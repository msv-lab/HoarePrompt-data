Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[x][j]` is True and `ans[fa[x]][j]` was an empty list, after execution, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now True. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` is True, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is True.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is True, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is True**
