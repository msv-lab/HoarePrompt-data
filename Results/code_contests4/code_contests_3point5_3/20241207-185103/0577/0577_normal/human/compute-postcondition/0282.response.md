Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by adding the values of `ans[x][j]` to it. The value of `j` should be the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` after the current `j`, and `j` should not be in `ans[x]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1, `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` after the current `j`, and `j` is not in `ans[x]`.

Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1, `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` after the current `j`, and `j` is not in `ans[x]`**
