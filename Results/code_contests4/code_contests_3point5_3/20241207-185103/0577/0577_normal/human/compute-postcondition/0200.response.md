Output State: **`nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` remain unchanged. If `x` is not equal to 0 and the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[x]` is an empty set. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to be the same as `ans[x]`, and `nowlistindex` is updated accordingly.**
