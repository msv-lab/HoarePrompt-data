Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[fa[x]]` has at least one element, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then the program updates the state accordingly. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated based on the comparison of the lengths of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `len(ans[x][j])` is greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, `ans[x][j]` is updated by taking the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty set. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is cleared.***
