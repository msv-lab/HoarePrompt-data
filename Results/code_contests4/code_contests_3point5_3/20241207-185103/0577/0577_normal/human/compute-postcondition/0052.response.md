Example Answer:
The code clears the content of `ans[x][j]`. This ensures that either `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]` or the length of `ans[x][j]` is now less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **Content of `ans[x][j]` is cleared, ensuring either `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]` or the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]**.
