Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, meaning it is emptied. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **All variables are integers. `ans[x][j]` is updated with the result of a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.**
