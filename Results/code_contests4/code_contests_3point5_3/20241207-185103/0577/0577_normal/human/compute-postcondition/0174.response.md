Postcondition: ***All variables are integers. If the length of ans[x][j] is greater than the length of ans[fa[x]][j], ans[x][j] is updated to include the elements of ans[fa[x]][j]. If the length of ans[x][j] is not greater than the length of ans[fa[x]][j], ans[fa[x]][j] is updated to include the values of ans[x][j]. nowlistindex is updated accordingly based on the execution path.***
