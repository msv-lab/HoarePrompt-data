Example Answer:
The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The previous values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are unknown. The element `j` may be updated to the next element in `ans[x]` if available. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` is assigned to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is assigned to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]**
