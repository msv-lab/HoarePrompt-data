Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j`, `fa[x]` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][j]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[x]` is not empty and `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`. Additionally, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by taking the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and after execution, `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to include the values of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.***
