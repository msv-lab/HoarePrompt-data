Postcondition: ***`query[x]` has a length of at least 2, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is equal to the length of `query[x]`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` if the length of `query[x]` is odd, or the second-to-last element if the length is even, `j` is assigned the last element in `query[x]` if the length is even, and remains the same if the length is odd, depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` will be either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, `len(ans[x])` is less than `len(ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to the value of `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` has been updated with the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j`.***
