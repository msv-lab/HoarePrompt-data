Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` is not empty. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[x][j]` and the previous value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`. `j` remains the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list.***
