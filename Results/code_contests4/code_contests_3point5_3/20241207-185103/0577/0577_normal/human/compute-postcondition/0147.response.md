Example Answer: 
The list `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared by the `clear()` method. This means that all elements in the list `ans[fa[x]][j]` are removed. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `j` may be updated to the next element in `ans[x]` if available, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.**
