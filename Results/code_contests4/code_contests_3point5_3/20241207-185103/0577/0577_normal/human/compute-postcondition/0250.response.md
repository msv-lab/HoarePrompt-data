Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Since `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the first iteration, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated based on this assignment. All other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `fa[x]`, `j` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1, `ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the first iteration, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated**
