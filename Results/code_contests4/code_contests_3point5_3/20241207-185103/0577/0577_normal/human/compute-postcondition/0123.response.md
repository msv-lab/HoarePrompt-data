Output State: **All variables nowChild[x], lenChild[x], dep, x, ans[x][dep], query[x], i, j are integers. x is not equal to -1. ans[x][dep] contains the set ss[x], nowlistindex is incremented to the next valid index within the range of query[x] with an increment of 2, and j is assigned the next value from query[x]. If dep + i is not in ans[x], then answer[j] is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, answer[j] is assigned the length of ss[x]. i is assigned the value of query[x][nowlistindex], j is assigned the value of query[x][nowlistindex + 1]**
