Output State: **`query[x]` has a length of at least 2, `nowlistindex` is equal to the length of `query[x]`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` if the length of `query[x]` is odd, or the second-to-last element if the length is even, `j` is assigned the last element in `query[x]` if the length is even and remains the same if the length is odd, depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` will be either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, `len(ans[x])` is equal to or larger than `len(ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]`**.
