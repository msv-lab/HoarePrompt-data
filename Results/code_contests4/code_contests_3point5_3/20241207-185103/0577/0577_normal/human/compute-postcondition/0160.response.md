Output State: **ans[x] and ans[fa[x]] contain the merged sets of ss[x] and ss[fa[x]] for all elements in ans[x] that are also present in ans[fa[x]]. If an element in ans[x] is not present in ans[fa[x]], ans[fa[x]] is updated with the value of ans[x]. If the length of the set in ans[x] for an element is less than the length of the set in ans[fa[x]] for the same element, the set in ans[fa[x]] is updated with the union of the sets in ans[x] and ans[fa[x]]. Otherwise, the set in ans[x] is updated with the union of the sets in ans[x] and ans[fa[x]].**
