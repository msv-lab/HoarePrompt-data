Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[x][j]` and the previous value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `ans[x]`, `fa[x]`, and `j` are used in the operation. 
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[x][j]` and the previous value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time.**
