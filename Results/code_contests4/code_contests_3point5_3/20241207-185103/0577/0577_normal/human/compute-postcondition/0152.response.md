Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The previous values of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` are not directly given, so the output state is: `ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time**
