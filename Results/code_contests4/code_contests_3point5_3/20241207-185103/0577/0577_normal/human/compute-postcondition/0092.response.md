Output State: **For each unique element `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`, if `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` will be updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be cleared. If `j` is in both `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]`, the larger set between `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` will be assigned to `ans[x][j]` and the other set will be cleared.**
