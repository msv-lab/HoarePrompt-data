Example Answer:
`dep` is incremented by 1. The values of `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, and `dep` are affected. After execution, the new value of `dep` will be the previous value of `dep` plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]` is updated to the value `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `lenChild[x]` remains unchanged, `dep` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`nowChild[x]` is updated to the value `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `lenChild[x]` remains unchanged, `dep` is incremented by 1**
