Example Answer:
The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the content of the list `ans[x][j]`. It does not change the values of any other variables. After execution, the content of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the values that were cleared from `ans[x][j]`.
Output State: **ans[fa[x]][j] is updated to include the values of ans[x][j]**
