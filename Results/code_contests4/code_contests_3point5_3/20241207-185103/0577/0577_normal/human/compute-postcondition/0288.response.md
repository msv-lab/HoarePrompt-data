Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `x`, `j`, and `fa[x]` are not given, so the output state is: The states that need to be adjusted depend on the specific conditions met in the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **The states that need to be adjusted depend on the specific conditions met in the next iteration of the loop**
