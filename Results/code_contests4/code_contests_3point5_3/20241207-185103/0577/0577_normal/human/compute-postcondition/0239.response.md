Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[x]` is not empty and `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`. Additionally, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. The length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. `ans[x][j]` is updated to include the values of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
