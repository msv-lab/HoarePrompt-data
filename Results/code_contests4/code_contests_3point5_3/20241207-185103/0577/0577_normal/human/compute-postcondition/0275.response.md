Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous values of the variables are not affected, so the output state is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j` remain integers. `ans[x][dep]` is the set containing the value of `ss[x]`. `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. The length of `ans[x]` is still greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. The set `ans[x][j]` is now cleared.
