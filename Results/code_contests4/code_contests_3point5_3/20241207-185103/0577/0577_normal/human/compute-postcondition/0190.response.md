Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is cleared after the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `ans[x][j]` are cleared, but the values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been updated after performing a bitwise OR operation; `ans[x][j]` is cleared.
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` has been updated after performing a bitwise OR operation; `ans[x][j]` is cleared**
