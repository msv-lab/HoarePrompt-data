Example Answer:
The code clears the elements of the list ans[fa[x]]. The final state of ans[x] will be a combination of the elements from ans[x] and an empty list after clearing ans[fa[x]]. The nowlistindex will be updated accordingly based on the cleared elements. 
Output State: **ans[fa[x]] is an empty list, ans[x] is updated based on the combination of elements from ans[x] and the cleared ans[fa[x]], nowlistindex is updated accordingly**
