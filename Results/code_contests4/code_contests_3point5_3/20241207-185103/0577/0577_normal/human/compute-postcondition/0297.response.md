Example Answer:
The set `ans[fa[x]]` is cleared. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.
Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.**
