Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. Then, `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. The value of `j` and the contents of `answer` are unknown, so the output state is `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `answer[j]` is 0.
Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `answer[j]` is 0**
