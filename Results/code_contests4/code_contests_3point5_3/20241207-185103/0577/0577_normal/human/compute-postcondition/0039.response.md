Postcondition: ***If j is not in ans[fa[x]], ans[fa[x]][j] is assigned the value of ans[x][j], len(ans[x]) is less than len(ans[fa[x]]), and j is not in ans[fa[x]]. If j is in ans[fa[x]], the length of ans[x][j] is compared with the length of ans[fa[x]][j]. If the length of ans[x][j] is less than the length of ans[fa[x]][j, ans[fa[x]][j] is updated with the bitwise OR operation of ans[x][j] and ans[x][j] is cleared. Otherwise, ans[fa[x]][j] is set to ans[x][j], and ans[x][j] is updated with the result of the bitwise OR operation between ans[x][j] and ans[fa[x]][j].***
