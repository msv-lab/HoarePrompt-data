According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `ans[x]` and `fa[x]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans[x]` is not empty. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x]` becomes empty, otherwise `ans[x][j]` is assigned to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. 

So for the loop to execute another time, the next element `j` in `ans[x]` must be available.
State: **`ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time**
