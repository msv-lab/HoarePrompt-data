Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers and `x` is not equal to -1. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1 and `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are decremented by 1. Depending on the condition, `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` may be updated, and `nowlistindex` may be updated as well. If `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` remain unchanged.***
