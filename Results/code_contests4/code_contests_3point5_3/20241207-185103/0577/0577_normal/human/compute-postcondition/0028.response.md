Postcondition: ***query[x] has a length of at least 2, ans[x] has at least 1 element, nowlistindex is equal to the length of query[x], i is the last element in query[x] if the length of query[x] is odd, or the second-to-last element if the length is even, j is assigned the last element in query[x] if the length is even, and remains the same if the length is odd, depending on whether dep + i is in ans[x], answer[j] will be either 0 or the length of ans[x][dep + i], len(ans[x]) is less than len(ans[fa[x]]), j not in ans[fa[x]]***
