Example Answer:
The value of `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, where `fa[x]` represents the value at index `x` in the array `fa`. The previous values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are unknown, so it is not possible to calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: No specific information is provided about other variables.
Output State: **No specific information is provided about other variables**
