According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` in `ans[x]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the set `ans[x]` must not be empty. Before the loop starts, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]` does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `ans[x]` must not be empty and `j` must be the first element in `ans[x]`. 
State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[x]` is not empty and `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`.**
