Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The value of `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` after the current `j`, and `j` is not in `ans[x]`. Therefore, after execution, the set `ans[x]` will contain the value of `ss[x]` and the value of `j` will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` after the current `j`, and `j` is not in `ans[x]`.**
