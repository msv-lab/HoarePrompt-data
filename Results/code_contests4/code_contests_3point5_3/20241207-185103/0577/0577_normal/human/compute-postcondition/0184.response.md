Postcondition: ***All variables are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, there is no specific impact on the variables `ans`, `x`, `fa`, and `j` after the execution of the if else block.***
