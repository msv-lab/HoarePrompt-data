Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` after performing a bitwise OR operation. The previous value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been updated after performing a bitwise OR operation; `ans[x][j]` is cleared.
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` has been updated after performing a bitwise OR operation; `ans[x][j]` is cleared**
