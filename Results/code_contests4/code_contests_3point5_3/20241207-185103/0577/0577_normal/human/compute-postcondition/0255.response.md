Output State: **All variables are integers. If j is not in ans[fa[x]], then the state remains unchanged. If the length of ans[x][j] is less than the length of ans[fa[x]][j], then ans[fa[x]][j] is equal to ans[x][j]. Otherwise, ans[fa[x]][j] will be updated to the bitwise OR of ans[fa[x]][j] and ans[x][j].**
