Postcondition: ***`query[x]` has a length of at least 2, `nowlistindex` starts at 0, `i` is assigned the value `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is assigned the value of the second element in `query[x]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is now assigned the value 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
