Postcondition: ***`query[x]` has a length of at least 2. `nowlistindex` is incremented by 4. `i` is assigned a value based on `query[x][nowlistindex]`. `j` is assigned a value based on `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. If dep + i is not in ans[x], then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
