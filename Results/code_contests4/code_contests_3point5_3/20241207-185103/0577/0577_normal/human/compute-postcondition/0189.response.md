Example Answer:
The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of the current value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. All variables are integers, so the bitwise OR operation is performed on the integers. The output state is not explicitly mentioned, so we can assume that the output state includes the updated values of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` has been updated after performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`**
