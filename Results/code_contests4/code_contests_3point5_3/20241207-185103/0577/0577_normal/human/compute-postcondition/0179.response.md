Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, which means all elements of the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` are removed. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables are integers, with `ans[x][j]` updated based on `ans[fa[x]][j] where the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.
Output State: **All variables are integers, with `ans[x][j] updated based on `ans[fa[x]][j] where the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared**
