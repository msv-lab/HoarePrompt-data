According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nowlistindex` and `query[x]`. If `nowlistindex` is less than the length of `query[x]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nowlistindex` needs to be increased by 2.
State: **`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 3]`.**
