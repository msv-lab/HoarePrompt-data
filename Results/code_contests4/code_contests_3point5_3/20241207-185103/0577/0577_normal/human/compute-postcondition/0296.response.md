Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, all variables retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, and the loop has finished executing.**
