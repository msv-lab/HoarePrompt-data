Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `j` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. If `x != 0` and len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]]), `ans[x]` is an empty list and all other variables retain their current integer values. If `x != 0` and len(ans[x]) >= len(ans[fa[x]]), `ans[x]` has the same values as `ans[fa[x]]` and the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
