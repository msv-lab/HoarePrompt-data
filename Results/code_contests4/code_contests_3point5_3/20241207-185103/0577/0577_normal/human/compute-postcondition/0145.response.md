Example Answer:
The `clear()` method is called on the element at index `j` of the list `ans[x]`, which empties the list. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x]` is now empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`ans[x]` is now empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time**
