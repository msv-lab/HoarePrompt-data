Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, where `Child` is a 2D list. The value of `x` is used to index into the `Child` list to access another value. The loop will execute again if `x` is not equal to -1 and the condition `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers, and for the loop to execute again `x` is not equal to -1. The condition `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.
Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers, and for the loop to execute again `x` is not equal to -1. The condition `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`**
