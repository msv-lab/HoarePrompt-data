Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous state of `ans[x][j]` is cleared, and the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is copied to `ans[x][j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
