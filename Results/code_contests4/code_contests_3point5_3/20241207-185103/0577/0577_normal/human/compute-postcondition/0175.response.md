Postcondition: ***All variables are integers. If j is not in ans[x], ans[x][j] is assigned the value of ans[fa[x]][j]. If j is in ans[x], the length of ans[x][j] is compared to the length of ans[fa[x]][j]. If the length of ans[x][j] is greater, ans[x][j] is updated to include the elements of ans[fa[x]][j]. If the length of ans[x][j] is not greater, ans[fa[x]][j] is updated to include the values of ans[x][j]. nowlistindex is updated accordingly based on the execution path.***
