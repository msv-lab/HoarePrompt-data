Output State: **After the loop finishes, `nowlistindex` is equal to the length of `query[x]`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]`, `j` is the last element in `query[x]`, and depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` will be either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. Additionally, `len(ans[x])` is less than `len(ans[fa[x]]`**
