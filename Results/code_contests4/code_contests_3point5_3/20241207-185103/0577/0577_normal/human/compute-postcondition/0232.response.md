Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[x]` is not empty and `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`. Additionally, after the if condition `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`***
