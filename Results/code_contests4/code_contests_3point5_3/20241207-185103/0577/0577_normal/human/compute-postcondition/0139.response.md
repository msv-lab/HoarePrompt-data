Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list, after execution, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will now contain the same elements as `ans[x][j]`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now populated with the elements of `ans[x][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now populated with the elements of `ans[x][j]`**
