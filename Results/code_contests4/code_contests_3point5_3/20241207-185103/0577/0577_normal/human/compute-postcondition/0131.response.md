Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The variable `j` is set to the first element in `ans[x]`, so `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: *ans[x] is not empty, j is set to the first element in ans[x], `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]`.
Output State: ***ans[x] is not empty, j is set to the first element in ans[x], `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]***.
