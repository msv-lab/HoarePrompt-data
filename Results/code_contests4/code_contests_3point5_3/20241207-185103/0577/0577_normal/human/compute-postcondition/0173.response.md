Example Answer:
The value of `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are unknown, but after execution, `ans[x][j]` will contain the values of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: ans[fa[x]][j] is updated to include the values of ans[x][j].
Output State: **ans[fa[x]][j] is updated to include the values of ans[x][j]**
