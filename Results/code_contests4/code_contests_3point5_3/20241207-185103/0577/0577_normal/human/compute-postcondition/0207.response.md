Example Answer:
`ans[x][dep]` is assigned a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers and `x` is not equal to -1, `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`.
Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers and `x` is not equal to -1, `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`**
