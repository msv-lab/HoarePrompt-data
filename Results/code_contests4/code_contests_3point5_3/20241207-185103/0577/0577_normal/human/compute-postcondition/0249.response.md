Example Answer:
The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list at the specified index `j` within the list at index `fa[x]` in the `ans` list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `fa[x]`, `j` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1, `ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the first iteration, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `fa[x]`, `j` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1, `ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the first iteration, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
