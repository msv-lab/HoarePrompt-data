Example Answer:
The value at `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value at `ans[x][j]`. To enable the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the values of `fa[x]` and `x` allow for another iteration. Therefore, `fa[x]` and `x` should be adjusted to achieve this. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **Adjust the states based on the conditions mentioned above to enable the loop to execute one more time**
