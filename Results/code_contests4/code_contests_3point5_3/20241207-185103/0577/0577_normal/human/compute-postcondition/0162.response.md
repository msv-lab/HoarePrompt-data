Postcondition: ***All variables nowChild[x], lenChild[x], dep, x, ans[x][dep], query[x], i, j are integers. x is not equal to -1. ans[x][dep] contains the set ss[x]. If dep + i is not in ans[x], then answer[j] is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, answer[j] is assigned the length of ss[x]. nowlistindex is updated to the next valid index within the range of query[x]. i is assigned the value of the last element of query[x]. j is assigned the value of the last element of query[x]. The length of ans[x] is not less than the length of ans[fa[x]].***
