Example Answer:
The list `ans[x][j]` is cleared after the code execution. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[x][j]` and the previous value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time, `ans[x][j]` is cleared.
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[x][j]` and the previous value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time, `ans[x][j]` is cleared**
