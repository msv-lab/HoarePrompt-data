Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` is not empty. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x]` becomes empty, and `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
