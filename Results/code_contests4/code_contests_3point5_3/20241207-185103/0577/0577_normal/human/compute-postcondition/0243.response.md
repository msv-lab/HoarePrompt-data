Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `fa[x]`, `j` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[x]` is not empty and `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`. After the if-else block executes, the state of the program variables will be as follows: If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be updated by taking the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` will be cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` will be updated to include the values of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be cleared.***
