Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. `nowlistindex` is 0. For the loop to execute, `query[x]` has elements to iterate over. `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
