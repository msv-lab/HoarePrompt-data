Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `x`, `j`, and `fa` are not provided, so the specific values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables are integers, the assignment of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]` has occurred.
Output State: **All variables are integers, the assignment of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]` has occurred**
