Example Answer:
The `clear()` method is called on the list `ans[x][j]`, which clears all elements from the list. The loop will execute one more time since the list `ans[x][j]` has been cleared. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: Loop will execute one more time.
Output State: **Loop will execute one more time**
