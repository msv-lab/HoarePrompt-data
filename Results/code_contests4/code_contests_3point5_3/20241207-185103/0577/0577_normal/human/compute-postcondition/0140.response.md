Postcondition: ***ans[x] is not empty, j is set to the first element in ans[x], j is in ans[fa[x]]. If len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j]), then the length of ans[fa[x]][j] is equal to the maximum of the lengths of ans[x][j] and ans[fa[x]][j]. Otherwise, ans[x][j] is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with ans[fa[x]][j], and ans[fa[x]][j] is now populated with the elements of ans[x][j]***
