Example Answer:
The `ans[x]` list is cleared, which means all elements inside it are removed. This action affects the values of `ans[x]`, `len(ans[x])`, `len(ans[fa[x]])`, and depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]`. Since `ans[x]` is cleared, it is now an empty list. This also implies that the length of `ans[x]` is 0. Since `len(ans[x])` is now 0, it is less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`. The values of `i` and `j` remain the same. Depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` will now be 0 since `ans[x]` is empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x]` is an empty list, `len(ans[x])` is 0, `len(ans[fa[x]])` is still greater than 0, `i` and `j` remain the same, and `answer[j]` is now 0.
Output State: **`ans[x]` is an empty list, `len(ans[x])` is 0, `len(ans[fa[x]])` is still greater than 0, `i` and `j` remain the same, `answer[j]` is now 0**
