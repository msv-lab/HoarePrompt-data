Example Answer:
The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list `ans[x][j]`. Since `j` is the first element in `ans[x]` and `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Therefore, after execution, the list `ans[x][j]` becomes empty.
Output State: **ans[x][j] is an empty list, j is set to the first element in ans[x], j is in ans[fa[x]], len(ans[x][j]) is less than len(ans[fa[x]][j]), and the length of ans[fa[x]][j] is equal to the maximum of the lengths of ans[x][j] and ans[fa[x]][j]**
