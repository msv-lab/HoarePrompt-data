Example Answer:
The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, the state remains unchanged. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be updated based on the conditions mentioned. 
Output State: **The state of the variables is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.**
