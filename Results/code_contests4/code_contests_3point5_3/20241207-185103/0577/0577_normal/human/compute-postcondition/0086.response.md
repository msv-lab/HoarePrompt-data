Example Answer:
The clear() method is called on the list located at ans[fa[x]][j]. The loop will not execute one more time, so the impact of this code is that the list at ans[fa[x]][j] is cleared. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will not execute one more time.
Output State: **The loop will not execute one more time.**
