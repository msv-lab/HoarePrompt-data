Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The previous state of `ans[x][j]` is unknown, but now `ans[fa[x]][j]` has the same value. `j` remains the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `j` remains the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `j` remains the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list**
