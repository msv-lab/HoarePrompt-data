Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. Then, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. The values of `x`, `nowlistindex`, `dep`, and `i` are unknown, so we cannot determine the specific values of `j` and `answer[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, and `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.
Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, and `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`**
