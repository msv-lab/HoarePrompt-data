The value of `j` is assigned the value from `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]` and `dep + i` is calculated. `len(ans[x][dep + i])` returns the length of the set `ss[x]`. Therefore, `answer[j]` is assigned this length value. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **All variables remain integers, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ss[x]`**
