Example Answer:
The value of `dep` is incremented by 1. The values of `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` are not changed, and the loop will execute again as long as `x` is not equal to -1 and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.
Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`**
