Postcondition: ***All variables are integers. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the result of a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is not greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been updated after performing a bitwise OR operation, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared.***
