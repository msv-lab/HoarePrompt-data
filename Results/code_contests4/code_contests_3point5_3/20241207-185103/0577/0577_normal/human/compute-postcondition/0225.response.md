Example Answer:
`j` is now `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]` and `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. After executing the code `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is now `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `answer[j]` is 0.
Output State: **`j` is now `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `answer[j]` is 0**
