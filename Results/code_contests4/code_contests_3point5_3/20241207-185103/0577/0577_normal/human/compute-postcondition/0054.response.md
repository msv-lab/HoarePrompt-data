Example Answer:
The code clears the contents of the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes in the state of the variables to maintain the condition that either `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]` or the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
Output State: **No changes in the state of the variables to maintain the condition that either `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]` or the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]**.
