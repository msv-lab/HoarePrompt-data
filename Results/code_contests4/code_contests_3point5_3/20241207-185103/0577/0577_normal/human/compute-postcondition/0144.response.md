Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation between the values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are not given, so the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time**
