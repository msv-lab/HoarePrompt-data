Postcondition: ***`x` is of any value other than -1. `nowChild` and `lenChild` are lists. The element at index `x` in both lists are equal. If `x` is not equal to 0, `query[x]` has a length of at least 2. After the loop finishes, `nowlistindex` is equal to the length of `query[x]`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` if the length of `query[x]` is odd, or the second-to-last element if the length is even. `j` is assigned the last element in `query[x]` if the length is even, and remains the same if the length is odd. Depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` will be either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. If `ans[x]` is an empty list and `len(ans[x])` is 0, while `len(ans[fa[x]])` is greater than 0, then `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`, `i` and `j` remain the same, and `answer[j]` becomes 0. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
