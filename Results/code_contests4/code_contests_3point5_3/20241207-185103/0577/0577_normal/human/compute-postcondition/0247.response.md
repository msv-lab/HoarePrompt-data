Example Answer:
The `clear()` method is called on `ans[x][j]`, which clears all elements from the list. The variables `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `fa[x]`, `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `fa[x]`, `j` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the first iteration, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x`, `fa[x]`, `j` are integers, `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x]` is not empty, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the first iteration, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
