Correctness: **False**

The code provided is quite complex and difficult to understand without a clear explanation of the logic and purpose of the function `func_1`. The function seems to involve updating some data structures based on certain conditions, but the exact nature of these updates and their significance is not apparent. The lack of a clear indication of the end goal or intended behavior makes it challenging to determine if the code follows the problem description for every potential case.

Additionally, the output hints do not provide a clear understanding of the expected functionality of the function. The hints mention some transformations and assignments happening to various variables but do not specify the exact task or processing being carried out by the function. This ambiguity makes it difficult to verify if the code aligns with the problem description for all cases.

Without a clear understanding of the purpose of the function and the expected behavior, it is hard to determine if the code is correct. Further clarification and context are needed to assess the correctness of the program.
