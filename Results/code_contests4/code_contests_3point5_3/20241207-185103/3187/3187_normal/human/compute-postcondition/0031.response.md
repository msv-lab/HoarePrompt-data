According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ans` at index `i`. If there are elements in `ans` at index `i`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the length of the element at index `i` in `ans` is printed, so it needs to be adjusted to `ans[i]` has elements and j is the first element in `ans[i]`.
State: **The length of the element at index `i` in `ans` is printed, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[i]` has elements, j is the first element in `ans[i]`**
