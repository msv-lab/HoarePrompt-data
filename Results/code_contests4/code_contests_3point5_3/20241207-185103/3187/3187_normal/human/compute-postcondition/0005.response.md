According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, `ans` contains [[1, 1]], `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than or equal to 2**
