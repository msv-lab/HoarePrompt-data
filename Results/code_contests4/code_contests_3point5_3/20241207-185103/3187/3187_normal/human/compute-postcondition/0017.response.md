Example Answer:
The code appends a new sublist `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1` in the `ans` list. Given that `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `j` is the fourth list of integers in `edges`, the new sublist will have values `[1 + n + 1, j[0]]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` contains at least 3 lists of integers, `ans` is updated with a new sublist at index `j[1] - 1` containing the value `[i + n + 1, j[1]]`, `i` is 1, `j` is the fourth list of integers in `edges`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` contains at least 3 lists of integers, `ans` is updated with a new sublist at index `j[1] - 1` containing the value `[i + n + 1, j[1]]`, `i` is 1, `j` is the fourth list of integers in `edges`**
