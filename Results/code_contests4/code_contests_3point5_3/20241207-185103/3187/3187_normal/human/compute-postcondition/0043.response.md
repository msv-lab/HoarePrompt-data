Example Answer:
Since `j` is not defined, an error will occur when trying to print it. To avoid the error, `j` must be defined. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must be defined and `i` must be within the bounds of `ans`. Since these conditions are not met, the code will not execute successfully.
Output State: **Error: j is not defined, `ans` and `i` are not defined or within bounds for the loop to execute**
