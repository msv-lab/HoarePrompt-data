Example Answer:
The code prints the elements in the list `j` with a space in between them. The variable `j` is the last element in the list at the new index `i` in `ans`. Since `ans` contains elements and `i` is within the bounds of `ans`, `j` represents the last element. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is within the bounds of `ans` (updated), `j` is the last element in the list at the new index `i` in `ans`, `ans` contains elements, the length of the first element in `ans` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is within the bounds of `ans` (updated), `j` is the last element in the list at the new index `i` in `ans`, `ans` contains elements, the length of the first element in `ans` is printed**
