The code appends a new list to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1` of the `ans` list. The new list contains two elements: `i + n + 1` and `j[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 element, `ans` contains [[1, 1], [2, 2], ..., [n, n], [i + n + 1, j[0]]], `i` is 0, `j` is the first list of integers in `edges`**
