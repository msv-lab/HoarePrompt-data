Example Answer:
The code appends the list `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1` in the `ans` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `edges`, `i`, `j` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` contains at least 3 lists of integers, `ans` contains [[1, 1], [2, 2], ..., [n, n], [i + n + 1, j[0]], [i + n + 1, j[1]]], `i` is 0, `j` is the third list of integers in `edges.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` contains at least 3 lists of integers, `ans` contains [[1, 1], [2, 2], ..., [n, n], [i + n + 1, j[0]], [i + n + 1, j[1]], [i + n + 1, j[0]]], `i` is 0, `j` is the third list of integers in `edges**
