According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ans` at index `i`. If there are more elements in `ans[i]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the length of the element at index `i` in `ans` is printed, `ans[i]` has elements, and `j` is the first element in `ans[i]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ans[i]` must have more elements, and `j` must be the next element in `ans[i] after the last iteration.
State: **The length of the element at index `i` in `ans` is printed, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[i]` has more elements, `j` is the next element in `ans[i]**
