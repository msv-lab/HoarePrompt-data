Example Answer:
The code initializes two lists, `edges` and `ans`, with specific values. `edges` is populated with `m` lists of integers returned by the `rints()` function, and `ans` is initialized with `n` empty lists. Since the initial state does not provide information about the specific values returned by `rints()` or the contents of the lists, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, `ans` is a list of empty lists**
