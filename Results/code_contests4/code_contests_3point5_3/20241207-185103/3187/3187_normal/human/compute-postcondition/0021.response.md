Example Answer:
The code prints the length of the `i-th` element in the list `ans`. The value of `i` is 0, so it will print the length of the first element in `ans`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is the last list of integers in `edges`, `ans` contains the updated values after all iterations, the length of the first element in `ans` is printed**
