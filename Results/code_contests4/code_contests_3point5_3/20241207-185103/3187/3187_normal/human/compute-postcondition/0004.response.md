Example Answer: 
`ans[i - 1]` accesses the list at index 0 in `ans` and appends the list `[i, i]` to it. Since `i` is 1, the list `[1, 1]` is appended to the list at index 0 in `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, `ans` contains [[1, 1]], `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, `ans` contains [[1, 1]], `i` is 1**
