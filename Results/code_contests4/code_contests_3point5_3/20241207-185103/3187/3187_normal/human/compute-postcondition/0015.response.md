Example Answer:
The code appends the value `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` to the sublist at index `j[1] - 1` in the `ans` list. The value of `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `j` is the third list of integers in `edges`. Therefore, after execution, the `ans` list will be updated with the new sublist at index `j[1] - 1` containing the value `[i + n + 1, j[1]]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` contains at least 3 lists of integers, `ans` is updated with a new sublist at index `j[1] - 1` containing the value `[i + n + 1, j[1]]`, `i` is 0, `j` is the third list of integers in `edges**.
