Example Answer: 
The `len` function is used to find the length of the element at index `i` in the list `ans`. The previous values indicate that `i` is updated to a valid index within the bounds of `ans`, and `ans` contains elements. Therefore, the length of the element at index `i` in `ans` is printed.
Output State: **The length of the element at index `i` in `ans` is printed**
