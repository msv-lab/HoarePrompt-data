Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are reassigned values from `rints()`, where `rints()` accepts two positive integers as input. The values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input provided. The constraints for `n` and `m` are 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints**
