Functionality: **The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `m`, then constructs a list `ans` with elements [[1, 1], [2, 2], ..., [n, n]]. It then updates `ans` based on the values in `edges`. Finally, it prints the length of each element in `ans` and the elements themselves. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
