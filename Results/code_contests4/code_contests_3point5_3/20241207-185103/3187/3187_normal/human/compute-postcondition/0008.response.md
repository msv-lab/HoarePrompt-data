Example Answer:
`ans[i - 1]` selects the sublist [2, 2] from the list `ans`. Then, `append([i, i])` appends [2, 2, [2, 2]] to the selected sublist. Therefore, after execution, the value of `ans` becomes [[1, 1], [2, 2, [2, 2]]].
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer satisfying the given constraints, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, `ans` contains [[1, 1], [2, 2, [2, 2]], `i` is 2**
