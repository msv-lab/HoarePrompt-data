Example Answer:
The lambda function `rints` is defined to take input from the standard input and convert it into a list of integers. The variables `n` and `m` are positive integers meeting the given conditions. Since the lambda function does not directly affect the values of `n` and `m`, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2).**
