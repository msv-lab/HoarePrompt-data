Example Answer:
The elements of `j` are printed with a space in between. The value of `j` is the last element in the list at the new index `i` in `ans`. The length of the first element in `ans` is already printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is updated to the next valid index within the bounds of `ans`, `j` is the last element in the list at the new index `i` in `ans`, `ans` contains elements, the length of the first element in `ans` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is updated to the next valid index within the bounds of `ans`, `j` is the last element in the list at the new index `i` in `ans`, `ans` contains elements, the length of the first element in `ans` is printed**
