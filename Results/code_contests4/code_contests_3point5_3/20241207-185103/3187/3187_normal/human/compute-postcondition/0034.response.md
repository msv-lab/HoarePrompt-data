Example Answer:
The code prints all elements in `j` separated by a space. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific elements that will be printed. Therefore, the Output State is: The length of the element at index `i` in `ans` is printed, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[i]` has more elements, `j` is the next element in `ans[i].
Output State: **The length of the element at index `i` in `ans` is printed, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[i]` has more elements, `j` is the next element in `ans[i]**
