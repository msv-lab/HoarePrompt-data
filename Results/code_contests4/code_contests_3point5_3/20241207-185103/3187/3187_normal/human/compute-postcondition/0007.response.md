According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer satisfying the given constraints, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, `ans` contains [[1, 1], [2, 2]], `i` is 2**
