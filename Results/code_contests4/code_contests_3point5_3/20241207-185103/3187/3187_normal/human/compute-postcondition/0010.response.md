According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `edges`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` contains [[1, 1], [2, 2], ..., [n, n]]. So for the loop to be executed, the list `edges` must have at least 1 element, and the index `i` is 0 and `j` is the first list of integers in the `edges` list.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 element, `ans` contains [[1, 1], [2, 2], ..., [n, n]], `i` is 0, `j` is the first list of integers in `edges`**
