According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the length of the element at index `i` in `ans` has been printed for each element in `ans[i]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **At the end of the last iteration, the length of the element at index `i+1` in `ans` is printed for each element in `ans[i+1]`**
