The code snippet appends a new list `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` to the list at index `j[1] - 1` in the `ans` list. Since `j` is the first list of integers in `edges`, `j[1]` refers to the second element of the first list in `edges`. 

Therefore, the new list `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` is appended to the list at index `j[1] - 1` in `ans`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 element, `ans` contains [[1, 1], [2, 2], ..., [n, n], [i + n + 1, j[0]], [i + n + 1, j[1]]], `i` is 0, `j` is the first list of integers in `edges`**
