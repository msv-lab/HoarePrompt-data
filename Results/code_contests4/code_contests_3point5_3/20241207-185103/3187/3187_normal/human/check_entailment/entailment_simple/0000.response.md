Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input values for the number of colors `n`, the number of pairs of harmonizing colors `m`, and the list of harmonizing color pairs `edges`. It then creates a list `ans` containing `n` sublists, each representing a color.

The program then fills the `ans` list with the coordinates of the rooks for each color. It ensures that each color has at least one rook on the board and that the set of rooks for each color is connected. It also ensures that the union of the sets of rooks of two different colors is connected if and only if the two colors harmonize with each other.

Finally, the program prints the number of rooks for each color and their corresponding coordinates.

The program follows the problem description and correctly arranges the rooks on the chessboard according to the given requirements.
