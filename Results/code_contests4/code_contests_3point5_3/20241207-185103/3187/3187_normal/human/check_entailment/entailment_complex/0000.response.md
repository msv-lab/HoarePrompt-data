Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values `n` and `m`, constructs a list `ans` containing the rooks for each color, updates the list based on the harmonizing pairs of colors, and then prints the rooks for each color with the required properties. The program ensures that for any color, there is a rook of that color on the board, the set of rooks of each color is connected, and the union of sets of rooks of different colors is connected if and only if those colors harmonize with each other. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
