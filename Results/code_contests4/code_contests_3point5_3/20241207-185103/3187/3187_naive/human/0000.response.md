Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and constructs the rooks arrangement based on the given pairs of colors that harmonize with each other. It ensures that each color has a rook on the board and that the sets of rooks of each color are connected. Additionally, it ensures that the union of sets of rooks of different colors is connected if and only if those colors harmonize with each other. The output format also matches the requirements specified in the problem description. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
