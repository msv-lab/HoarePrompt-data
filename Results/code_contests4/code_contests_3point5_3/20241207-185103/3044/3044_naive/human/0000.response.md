Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality of changing and displaying the current directory based on the input commands. It handles both absolute and relative paths correctly, including the ".." indicator to move up to the parent directory. The output produced by the program matches the expected absolute paths for the given commands. Additionally, the program processes the input commands in a loop, ensuring that it can handle multiple commands in a sequence.
