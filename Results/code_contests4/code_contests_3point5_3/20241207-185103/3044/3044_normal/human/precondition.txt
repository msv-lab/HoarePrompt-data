n is a positive integer indicating the number of commands. Each command is either pwd or cd followed by a non-empty parameter containing lower case Latin letters, slashes, and dots. The command parameter cd does not end with a slash, except when it points to the root directory. The length of the command parameter is between 1 and 200 characters, inclusive.**
