According to the code, the loop can execute multiple times depending on the value of `n` provided by the user. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the values in `cur` need to be updated based on the conditions related to `s`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is an empty string**
