Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`. The list `cur` was initially empty, and `x` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string where the first character is not '/'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string where the first character is not '/'**
