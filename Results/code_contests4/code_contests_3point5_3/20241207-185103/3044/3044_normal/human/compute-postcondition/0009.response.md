Example Answer:
The code snippet removes the first character of the string `s`. Since the first character of `s` is '/', after execution, `s` will be updated to remove the '/' character. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is the string without the first character '/'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is the string without the first character '/'**
