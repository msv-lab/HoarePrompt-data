Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the updated values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` contains at least two '/' for the loop to execute one more time. If x == '..', then the final values of `x` remain the same in `cur`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` contains at least two '/' for the loop to execute one more time.***
