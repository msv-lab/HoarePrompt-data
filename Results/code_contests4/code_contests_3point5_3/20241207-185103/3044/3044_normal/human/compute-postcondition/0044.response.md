According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s` and `x`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is modified to remove either the first element or the first two elements, and `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` should not be empty and `x` should be the first element in `s.split('/')`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` either does not contain the last element or contains x which is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove either the first element or the first two elements, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`**
