According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` provided by user input. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is a list. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', the list `cur` remains empty. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', and `s` is a non-empty string with all sections separated by '/'. If the first character of `s` was '/', it has been removed, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be incremented by 1**
