Example Answer:
The code `cur = cur[:-1]` removes the last character from the string stored in the variable `cur`. The value of `cur` changes based on the previous value, but the initial state of `cur` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of x where x is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from raw_input() after the first '/', for the loop to execute s contains at least one '/'. Additionally, `x` is equal to '..'.
