Example Answer:
After executing the code, the value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`. The initial state does not provide the value of `x`, so the final state will be: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the appended value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the appended value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/'**
