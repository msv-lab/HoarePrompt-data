Example Answer:
The code prints a string where the elements of `cur` are joined by '/' and preceded by '/'. The value of `cur` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the input string received from raw_input().
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the input string received from raw_input()**
