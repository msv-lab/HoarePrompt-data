According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s` which is modified in each iteration. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains x which is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove the first element. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must not be empty and `x` must be the first element in `s.split('/')`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains x which is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove the first element, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`**
