Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`. The list `cur` now contains the updated value of `x`. The positive integer `n` and the non-empty string `s` remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the appended value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/'**
