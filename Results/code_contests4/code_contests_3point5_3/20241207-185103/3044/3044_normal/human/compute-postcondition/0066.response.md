Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from `raw_input()` after the first '/', for the loop to execute one more time `s` contains at least two '/'. If x == '..', the program maintains the current state. Otherwise, new values are added to `cur` after this execution.***
