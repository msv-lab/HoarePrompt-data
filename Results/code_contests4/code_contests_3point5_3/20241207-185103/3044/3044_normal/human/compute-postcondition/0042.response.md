Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `cur`, and `x` is the first element of the list `s` after splitting. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains x which is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove the first element, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains x which is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove the first element, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`**
