According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value provided by the user. If the input is a non-negative integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is already a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, `cur` is an empty list, but the code does not specify any conditions related to `cur`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `cur`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the input value provided by the user must be a non-negative integer**
