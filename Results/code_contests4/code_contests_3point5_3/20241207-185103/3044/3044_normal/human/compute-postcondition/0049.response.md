Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1 if the loop executes one more time. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', `cur` remains empty. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', `cur` contains the elements in `s.split('/')` that are not '..', `i` is equal to the number of valid elements in `s.split('/')`, and `s` is an empty string.***
