Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from raw_input() after the first '/', for the loop to execute `s` contains at least one '/'. If `x` is equal to '..', then the program enters the if block. Otherwise, the program enters the else block where `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` and the value of `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from raw_input() after the first '/', for the loop to execute `s` contains at least one '/'.***
