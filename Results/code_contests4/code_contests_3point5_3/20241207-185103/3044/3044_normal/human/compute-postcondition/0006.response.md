Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the second word from the input provided by the user after splitting the input. Since the input provided by the user is not equal to 'pwd', the second word is guaranteed to exist. Therefore, the new value of `s` will be the second word from the input. The other variables `n` and `cur` remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is the second word from the user input**
