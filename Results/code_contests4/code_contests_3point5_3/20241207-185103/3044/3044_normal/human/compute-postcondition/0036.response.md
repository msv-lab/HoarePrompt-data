Example Answer:
The code `cur = cur[:-1]` removes the last element from the list `cur`. As the initial state mentions that `cur` is an empty list, removing the last element from an empty list will result in an empty list. All other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove the first element, for the loop to execute `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`, and the first element of `s.split('/')` is '..'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove the first element, for the loop to execute `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`, and the first element of `s.split('/')` is '..'**
