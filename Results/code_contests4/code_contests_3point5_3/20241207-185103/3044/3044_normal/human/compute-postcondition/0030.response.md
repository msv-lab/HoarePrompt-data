Example Answer:
The code splits the string `s` by whitespaces and retrieves the second element. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', the list `cur` remains empty. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', and `s` is a non-empty string with all sections separated by '/'. If the first character of `s` was '/', it has been removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1**
