Example Answer:
The last element of the list `cur` is removed by using slicing `cur[:-1]`. The value of `n` is a positive integer and the list `cur` contains the value of `x`, so after execution, the list `cur` will have one less element. The string `s` with sections separated by '/' remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the value of `x` with one less element, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/'**
