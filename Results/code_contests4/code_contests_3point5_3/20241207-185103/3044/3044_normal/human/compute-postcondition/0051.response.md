Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the input value received from the raw_input() function. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the input string received from raw_input().
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the input string received from raw_input()**
