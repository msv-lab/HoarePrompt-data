Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`, so `x` is added to the `cur` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` and the value of `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from raw_input() after the first '/', for the loop to execute `s` contains at least one '/'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` and the value of `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from raw_input() after the first '/', for the loop to execute `s` contains at least one '/'**
