According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `s` which is the input string received from `raw_input()` after the first '/'. If `s` contains at least one more '/', the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from `raw_input()` after the first '/'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain at least one more '/'.
