According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has more sections separated by '/', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cur` is a list containing the value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string. If `x` is equal to '..', the first character of `s` is removed if it was '/'. If `x` is not equal to '..', the first character is not removed from `s`. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have more sections separated by '/' after splitting.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is a list containing the value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/'**
