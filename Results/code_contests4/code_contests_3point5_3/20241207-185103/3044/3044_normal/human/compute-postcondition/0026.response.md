Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is a list. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', the list `cur` remains empty. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', and `s` is a non-empty string with all sections separated by '/'. If the first character of `s` was '/', it has been removed.***
