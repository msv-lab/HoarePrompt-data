Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1 if the if part is executed, or the number of times the loop executed if the else part is executed, `s` is the input string received from raw_input() in the if part, and the second element of the input string received from raw_input() after the last '/' in the else part. If `x` is equal to '..', then the program removes the last element from `cur`***
