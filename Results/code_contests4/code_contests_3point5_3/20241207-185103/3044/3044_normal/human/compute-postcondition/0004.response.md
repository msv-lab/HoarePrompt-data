Example Answer:
The code snippet prints '/' followed by each element in the list `cur` joined with '/'. However, since `cur` is empty and the input `s` is 'pwd', the output will be '/'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is 'pwd'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is 'pwd'**
