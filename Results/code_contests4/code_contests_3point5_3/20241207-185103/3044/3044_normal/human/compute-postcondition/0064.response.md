Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value of `cur` excluding the last character. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from `raw_input()` after the first '/', for the loop to execute one more time `s` contains at least two '/'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from `raw_input()` after the first '/', for the loop to execute one more time `s` contains at least two '/'**
