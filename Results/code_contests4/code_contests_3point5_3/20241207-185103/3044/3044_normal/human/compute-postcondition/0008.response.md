Example Answer:
`cur` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is the second word from the user input. The first character of `s` is '/'
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is the second word from the user input. The first character of `s` is '/'**
