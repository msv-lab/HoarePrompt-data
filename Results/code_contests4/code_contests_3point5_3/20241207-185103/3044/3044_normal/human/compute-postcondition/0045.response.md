Example Answer:
The last element is removed from `cur` using slicing, so if `cur` originally contained x, it no longer does. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` does not contain the last element, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove either the first element or the first two elements, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` does not contain the last element, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove either the first element or the first two elements, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`**
