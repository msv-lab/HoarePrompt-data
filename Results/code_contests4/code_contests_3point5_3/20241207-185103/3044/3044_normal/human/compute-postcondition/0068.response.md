Example Answer:
The last character of `cur` is removed using the `[:-1]` slicing operation. The value of `cur` changes accordingly. The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the updated values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` contains at least two '/' for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the updated values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` contains at least two '/' for the loop to execute one more time.**
