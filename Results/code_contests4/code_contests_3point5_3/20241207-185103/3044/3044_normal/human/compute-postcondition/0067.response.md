According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If `s` contains at least two '/', the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from `raw_input()` after the first '/'. So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain at least two '/'. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` contains at least two '/' for the loop to execute one more time.**
