According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute. Since `s` is the second word from the user input, it implies that the input has at least two words. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be a non-empty string. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and `cur` is an empty list. Additionally, if the first character of `s` is '/', then the first character should be removed from `s`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is a non-empty string, if the first character of `s` is '/', then the first character is removed from `s`**
