The input provided by the user is stored in the variable `s` using `raw_input()`. The previous values of `n` and `cur` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is the input provided by the user.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is an empty list, `s` is the input provided by the user**
