Example Answer:
The empty list `cur` is assigned to `cur`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from raw_input().
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from raw_input()**
