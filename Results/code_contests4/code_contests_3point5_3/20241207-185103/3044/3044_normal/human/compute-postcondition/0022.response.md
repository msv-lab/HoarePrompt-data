Example Answer:
The list `cur` is modified by removing the last element using slicing. The previous state of `cur` is unknown, so the updated `cur` list could have one less element than before. The variables `n` and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` either contains the value of `x` with one less element or the appended value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` either contains the value of `x` with one less element or the appended value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/'**
