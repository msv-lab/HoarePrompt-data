Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `cur`, so the list `cur` now contains the last element `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains x which is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove either the first element or the first two elements, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains x which is appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove either the first element or the first two elements, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`**
