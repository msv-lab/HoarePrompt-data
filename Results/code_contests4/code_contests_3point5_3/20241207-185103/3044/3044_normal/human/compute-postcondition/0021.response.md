According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `s`. If there are more sections left in the split string `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cur` is a list that either contains the value of `x` with one less element or the appended value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/' depending on whether `x` is equal to '..' or not. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more sections left in the split string `s`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` is a list that either contains the value of `x` with one less element or the appended value of `x`, `s` is a non-empty string with more sections separated by '/'**
