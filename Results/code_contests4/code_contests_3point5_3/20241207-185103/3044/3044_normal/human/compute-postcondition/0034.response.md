According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is modified to remove the first element does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is not empty and `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is modified to remove the first element, for the loop to execute `s` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `s.split('/')`**
