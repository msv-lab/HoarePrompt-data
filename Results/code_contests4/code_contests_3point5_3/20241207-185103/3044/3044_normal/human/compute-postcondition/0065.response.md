Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `cur`. The value of `x` is not given in the initial state, so the final values of `cur` will depend on the values of `x` when this code snippet is executed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..' and new values added after this execution, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from `raw_input()` after the first '/', for the loop to execute one more time `s` contains at least two '/'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cur` contains the final values of `x` where `x` is not equal to '..' and new values added after this execution, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the second element of the input string received from `raw_input()` after the first '/', for the loop to execute one more time `s` contains at least two '/'**
