Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the command parameter in 'cd' contains the '..' operator multiple times consecutively. For example, if the input command is "cd /home/vasya/../../petya", the code does not correctly handle navigating back multiple parent directories. The code only considers one '..' at a time and removes the last directory from the current path. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case as it does not correctly handle consecutive '..' operators in the command parameter.
