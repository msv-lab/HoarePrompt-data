Correctness: **True**

The provided program reads the input commands, processes them, and updates the current directory path `cur` accordingly. It correctly handles both 'pwd' and 'cd' commands as described in the problem description.

When the 'pwd' command is encountered, it prints the full absolute path of the current directory by joining the elements in `cur` with slashes.

When the 'cd' command is encountered, it correctly updates the current directory path based on the specified path. It handles both absolute paths (starting with '/') and relative paths. It correctly processes '..' to move up to the parent directory.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible cases.
