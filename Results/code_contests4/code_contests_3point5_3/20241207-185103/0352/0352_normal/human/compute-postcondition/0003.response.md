According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `sq` is False. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 1, `sq` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
