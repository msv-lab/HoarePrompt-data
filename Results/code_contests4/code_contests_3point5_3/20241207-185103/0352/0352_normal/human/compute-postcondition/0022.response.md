The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates under the precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52, and `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` are integers representing the cards in the deck, with the property that for all `i=1,...,n` there is exactly one `j∈{1,...,n}` such that `c_j = i`. The function does not return any value; its purpose is to verify the constraints and relationships described in the precondition. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the specified constraints and relationships. It verifies the properties of the deck of cards described in the precondition.**
