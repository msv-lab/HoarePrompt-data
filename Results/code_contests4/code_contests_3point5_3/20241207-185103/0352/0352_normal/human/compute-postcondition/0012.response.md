According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 12, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is already less than or equal to `n`, no adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`i` is 12, `sq` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again**
