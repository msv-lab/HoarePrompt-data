Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from the user, initializes a loop control variable i to 1, and iterates through the loop until i is greater than n. Within the loop, i is multiplied by 3 at each iteration. After the loop, if i equals n, the variable sq is set to True. Then, if sq is True, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the described constraints. It verifies if a specific property related to a deck of cards holds true.**
