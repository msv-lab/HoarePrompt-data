Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. The program is supposed to sort the deck of cards by splitting the deck into nonempty contiguous parts and reversing the order of the parts. However, the program does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates the value of `i` by multiplying it by 3 in a loop and then checks if `sq` is True, printing 'YES' if it is and 'NO' if it is not.

The program does not perform the required operations to sort the deck of cards as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
