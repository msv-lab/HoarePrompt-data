Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not implement the required functionality to sort the deck of cards as described in the problem description. The program reads an integer `n` from the user, initializes a loop control variable `i` to 1, and iterates through the loop until `i` is greater than `n`, multiplying `i` by 3 at each iteration. After the loop, if `i` equals `n`, the variable `sq` is set to True, and then it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `sq`. This program does not perform the deck sorting operations as described in the problem.

The program should have implemented a function that sorts the deck of cards by splitting the deck into contiguous parts and reversing the order of those parts as described in the problem description. The program should output the number of operations performed and the details of each operation to obtain a sorted deck.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
