Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply checks if the number n is a power of 3, and if it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. However, the problem description is related to sorting a deck of cards by splitting and reversing parts of the deck, which is not reflected in the code at all. The code does not address the task of sorting the deck by following the specified operations. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
