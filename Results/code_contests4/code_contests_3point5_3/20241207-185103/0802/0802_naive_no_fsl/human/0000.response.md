Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly handle the input constraints and logic specified in the problem description. The program is not iterating through the delivery destination locations correctly to find the nearest store for each order. Additionally, the program is checking for the presence of the delivery destination in a hardcoded modulo 8 calculation, which does not account for the actual distance values and locations provided in the input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
