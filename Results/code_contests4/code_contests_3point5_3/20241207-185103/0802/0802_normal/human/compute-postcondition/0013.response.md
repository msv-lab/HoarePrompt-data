Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless a break statement is encountered within the loop body. Given that `i` is increased by 1 after each iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the `i` variable which needs to be increased by 1.
State: **Output State: `d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `sum` remain unchanged. `i` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again**
