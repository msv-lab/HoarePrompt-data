Example Answer:
The `input` variable is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element of the list obtained by splitting the contents of the file object `f`. The `map` function returns a map object that needs to be converted into a list to see the values. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints, `f` is the file object for 'input.txt', `input` contains the integer values parsed from the file.
Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints, `f` is the file object for 'input.txt', `input` contains the integer values parsed from the file**
