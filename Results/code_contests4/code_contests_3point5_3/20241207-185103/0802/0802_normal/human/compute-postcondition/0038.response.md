Output State: `d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `sum`, `i` remain unchanged. The loop continues indefinitely, incrementing `i` by 1 each iteration and updating `k` to a new value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S`. The program breaks out of the loop when the condition is met.
