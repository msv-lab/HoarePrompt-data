According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `K` has at least 1 element. 
Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `K` has at least 1 element. 
State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints, `f` is closed, `S` is a set containing sorted values from 0 to the (n-1)th index of the input list, `K` is a list containing elements from the (n-1)th index to the end of the input list with at least 1 element, `sum` is 0**
