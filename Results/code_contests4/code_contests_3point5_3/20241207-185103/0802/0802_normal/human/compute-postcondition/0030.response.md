According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will continue indefinitely until a break statement is encountered. Therefore, all the states remain unchanged at the end of the previous iteration, except for `k` which needs to be updated to a new value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S` in order for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `sum`, `i` remain unchanged. `k` is updated to a new value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S` for the loop to execute one more time**
