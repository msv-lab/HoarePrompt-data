Example Answer:
The `close()` method is called on the file object `f`, which closes the file. The values of `d`, `n`, and `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints, and `f` is the file object for 'input.txt'. After closing the file, the file object `f` will no longer be usable for reading or writing. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints, `f` is closed.
Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints, `f` is closed**
