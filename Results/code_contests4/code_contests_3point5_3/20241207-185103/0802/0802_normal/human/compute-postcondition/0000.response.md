Example Answer:
The code opens a file named 'input.txt' in read mode and assigns it to the variable `f`. The previous values of `d`, `n`, and `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints. The values of these variables remain unchanged by opening the file. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints, `f` is the file object for 'input.txt'.
Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers within the specified constraints, `f` is the file object for 'input.txt'**
