Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1 until the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S` is met, then the loop breaks. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `sum` remain unchanged. `i` is increased until the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S` is met, then the loop breaks.**
