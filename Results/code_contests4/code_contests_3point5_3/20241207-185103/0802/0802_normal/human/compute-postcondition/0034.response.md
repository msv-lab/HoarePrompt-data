According to the code, the loop will execute indefinitely as it is a `while True` loop. To execute the loop one more time, we need to update the value of `k` to a new value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S`.

State: **`d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `sum`, `i` remain unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be updated to a new value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S`**
