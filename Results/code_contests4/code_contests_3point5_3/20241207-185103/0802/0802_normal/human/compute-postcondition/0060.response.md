Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `i` remain unchanged. The loop continues indefinitely incrementing `i` by 1 each iteration. `k` is updated to a new value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S`. The program breaks out of the loop when the condition is met. `sum` is incremented by `i` after each iteration. The value of `sum` is written to the file `f` as a string.**
