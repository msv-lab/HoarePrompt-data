According to the code, the `while True` loop will execute indefinitely unless there is a breaking condition. In this case, the breaking condition is when `(k + i) % 8` is in `S` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `sum` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 3**.
