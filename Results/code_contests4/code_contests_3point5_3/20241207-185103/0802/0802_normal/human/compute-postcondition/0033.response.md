Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `sum`, `i` remain unchanged. `k` is updated to a new value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S` for the loop to execute one more time. If the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S` is satisfied, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
