According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, the loop will certainly execute. Therefore, the states remain unchanged except for `k` and `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be updated to the next value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S`.
- `i` needs to be assigned the value 1.

State: **`d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `i` remain unchanged, `k` is updated to the next value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S`, `i` is assigned the value 1**
