**d, n, and m are positive integers such that 2 <= d <= 1000000000, 2 <= n <= 100000, and 1 <= m <= 10000. The values d2, ..., dn are integers representing the locations of stores other than the main store, such that 1 <= di <= d - 1. The values k1, ..., km are integers representing the delivery destination locations, such that 0 <= ki <= d.
