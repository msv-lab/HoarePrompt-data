The function `func` reads input from a file, processes the data to calculate a sum based on specific conditions, and writes the result to an output file. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function iterates indefinitely through a loop, incrementing a counter `i` until a certain condition is met with the elements in `S` and `K`. The sum is then calculated based on the value of `i` during each iteration. The code may potentially run into an infinite loop due to the while True statement.
