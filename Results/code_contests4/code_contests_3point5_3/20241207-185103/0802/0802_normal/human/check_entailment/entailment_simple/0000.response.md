Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. It has several issues:
1. The program is reading the input from a file named 'input.txt', but the problem description states that the input consists of multiple datasets and specifies the format of the input.
2. The program is using hardcoded values such as `8` instead of using the variable `d` to determine the modulus operation.
3. The program is using the value `8` in the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S`, which does not correspond to the given `d` value.
4. The program is not handling the case when `d` is `0` to indicate the end of input.

Overall, the program does not follow the problem description and has implementation errors.
