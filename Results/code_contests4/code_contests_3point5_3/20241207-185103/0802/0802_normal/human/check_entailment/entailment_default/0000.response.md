Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the while loop where the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S` is checked. This condition does not correctly account for the delivery destination location and the locations of the stores along the loop line. The code may potentially run into an infinite loop due to the while True statement. This means that the code does not accurately calculate the sum based on the specific conditions provided in the problem description.
