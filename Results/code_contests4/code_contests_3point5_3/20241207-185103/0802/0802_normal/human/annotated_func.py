#State of the program right berfore the function call: d, n, m are positive integers such that 2 <= d <= 1000000000, 2 <= n <= 100000, 1 <= m <= 10000. All other integers in the input are non-negative integers satisfying the given constraints.**
def func():
    f = open('input.txt', 'r')
    input = map(lambda x: int(x), f.read().strip().split('\n'))
    f.close()
    d, n, m = input[0], input[1], input[2]
    S, K = set(sorted([0] + input[3:3 + n - 1])), input[3 + n - 1:]
    sum = 0
    for k in K:
        i = 1
        
        while True:
            if (k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S:

            i += 1
        
        sum += i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `i` remain unchanged. The loop continues indefinitely, incrementing `i` by 1 each iteration and updating `k` to a new value from `K` that satisfies the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S`. The program breaks out of the loop when the condition is met. `sum` is incremented by `i` after each iteration.
    f = open('output.txt', 'w')
    f.write(str(sum))
    f.close()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from a file, processes the data to calculate a sum based on specific conditions, and writes the result to an output file. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function iterates indefinitely through a loop, incrementing a counter `i` until a certain condition is met with the elements in `S` and `K`. The sum is then calculated based on the value of `i` during each iteration. The code may potentially run into an infinite loop due to the while True statement.
