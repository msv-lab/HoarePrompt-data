Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for n, permutation p, and matrix A.
2. It then iterates through the permutation p and matrix A to determine if swaps are possible and performs the swaps if conditions are met.
3. Finally, it prints the prettiest permutation that can be obtained.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic provided and should work correctly for all test cases.
