Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and `i` is 0, so after execution, `j` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 1**
