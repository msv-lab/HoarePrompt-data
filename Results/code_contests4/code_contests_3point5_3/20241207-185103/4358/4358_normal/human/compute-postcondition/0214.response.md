Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a`, `j`, `p`, `tmp` remain as described in the precondition. The loop will continue to iterate until `j` is equal to or greater than `n`. The values in `p` will be sorted in non-decreasing order based on the conditions in the loop. The values in `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.**
