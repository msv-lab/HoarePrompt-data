Example Answer:
`p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`**
