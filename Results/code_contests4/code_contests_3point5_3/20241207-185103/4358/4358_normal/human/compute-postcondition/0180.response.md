According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than `n + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists containing converted values from strings, `j` is incremented by 1, `p` is updated and sorted in non-decreasing order, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `tmp` holds the value of the first element of the sorted list `p`, for the loop to execute `j` is less than `n + 1`**
