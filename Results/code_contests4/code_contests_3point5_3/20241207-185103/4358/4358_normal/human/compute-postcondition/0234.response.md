According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n`**
