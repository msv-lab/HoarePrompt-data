Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing converted values from strings, `j` is 5, `p[i]` equals `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` equals 1, `a[j][i]` equals 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[j]` is equal to `tmp`. If `p[i] > p[j]` and `a[i][j]` equals 1 and `a[j][i]` equals 1, then `p[i]` is updated to the value of `p[j`] after the execution of the if else block.***
