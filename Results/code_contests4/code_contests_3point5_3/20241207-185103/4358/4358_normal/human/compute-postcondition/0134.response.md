Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, so after execution, `j` is `i + 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`**
