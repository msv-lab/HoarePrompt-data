According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j+1` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j+1` is less than `n`, so no adjustments are needed for `j`. 
The conditions for modifying `p[i]` and `p[j]` are based on the comparison of `p[i]` and `p[j]`. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` must still hold true at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **`j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again**
