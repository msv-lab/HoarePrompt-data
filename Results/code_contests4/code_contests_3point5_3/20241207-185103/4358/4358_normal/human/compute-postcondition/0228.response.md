Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`**
