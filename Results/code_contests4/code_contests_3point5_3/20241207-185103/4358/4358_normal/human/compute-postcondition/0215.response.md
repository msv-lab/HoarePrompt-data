Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `n`, `a`, `j`, `p`, `tmp` remain as described in the precondition.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `n`, `a`, `j`, `p`, `tmp` remain as described in the precondition**
