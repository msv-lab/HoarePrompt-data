Output State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, where each character is either '0' or '1'. For all integers i,j where 1 <= i < j <= n, A[i][j] = A[j][i]. For all integers i where 1 <= i <= n, A[i][i] = '0'.**
