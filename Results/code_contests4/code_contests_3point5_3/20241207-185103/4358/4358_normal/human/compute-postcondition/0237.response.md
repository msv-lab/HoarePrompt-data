Example Answer:
The value of `tmp` is assigned the initial value of `p[i]`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n`**
