Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `n`, `p` are integers. `p[i]` is equal to `tmp`. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be less than `n`.
Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `n`, `p` are integers. `p[i]` is equal to `tmp`. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. For the loop to execute the first time, `j+1` should be less than `n`.**
