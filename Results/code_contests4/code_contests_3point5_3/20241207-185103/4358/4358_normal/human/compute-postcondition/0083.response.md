Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than `n` and `n` is greater than 1. `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`. Additionally, `a[i][j]` equals 1 and `a[j][i]` equals 1***
