Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than 1, `n` is such that 1 is less than `n`, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is incremented by 1, `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in `p`, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `j` is less than `n` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, and `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then the function continues with the specified conditions.***
