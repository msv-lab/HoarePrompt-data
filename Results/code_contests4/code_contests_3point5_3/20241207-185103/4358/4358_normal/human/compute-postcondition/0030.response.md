Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the affected variables are: `i` is increased by 2, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to the length of `s`, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the conditions in the if-else block for each character in `s`, `s` is a non-empty string. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is increased by 2, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the conditions in the if-else block for each character in `s`, `s` is a non-empty string.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 2, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the conditions in the if-else block for each character in `s`, `s` is a non-empty string**
