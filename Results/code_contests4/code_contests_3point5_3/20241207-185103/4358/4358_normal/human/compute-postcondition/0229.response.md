Example Answer:
The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, where `j` is `i+1`. The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before the change. Therefore, after execution, `p[i]` is updated with the value of `p[j]`, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`, and other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`**
