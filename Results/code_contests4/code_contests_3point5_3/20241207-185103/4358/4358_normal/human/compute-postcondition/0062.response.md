Postcondition: ***`i` is increased by 6, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b` appended with another list `b` with an additional element at the end based on the condition within the if else block, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 depending on the condition, `s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 0, and for the loop to execute the first time `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `s`. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is '1', `b` contains 1 and if it is not '1', `b` contains 0.***
