Example Answer:
The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The initial value of `p[i]` is stored in `tmp`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`, so `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n`**
