Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is initially 3 or greater, after execution, `i` will be greater than 3. The value of `s` is updated based on `p[i]`, but the details of `p` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 3, `s` is updated based on the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`i` is greater than 3, `s` is updated based on the value of `p[i]`**
