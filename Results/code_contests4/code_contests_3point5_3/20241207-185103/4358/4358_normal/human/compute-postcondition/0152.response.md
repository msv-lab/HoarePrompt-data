Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The values of `tmp`, `p[i]`, `j+1`, and `n` are not directly provided, so we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`**
