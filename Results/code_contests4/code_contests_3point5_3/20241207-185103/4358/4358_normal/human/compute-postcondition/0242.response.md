Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. If `p[i] > p[j]`, and `a[i][j] == 1` and `a[j][i] == 1`, the swapping of values between `p[i]` and `p[j]` is performed. The final output state ensures that the array `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
