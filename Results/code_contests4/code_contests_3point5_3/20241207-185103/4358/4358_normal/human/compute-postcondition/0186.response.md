Output State: **For `i` as 0, `n` greater than 1, `a` a list of lists containing converted values from strings, `j` incremented by 1, `p` updated and sorted in non-decreasing order, `tmp` holding the value of the first element of the sorted list `p`, for the loop to execute `j` less than `n + 1, if `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, and if `a[i][j]` equals 1 and `a[j][i]` equals 1, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` and `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. `j` is incremented by 1.**
