According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 1, `s` is '5', for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1**
