Example Answer:
`p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `p`, `j`, and `tmp` are not provided, so we can't determine the exact values after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `n`, `a` are all incremented by 1, `p` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be less than the new value of `n`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a` are all incremented by 1, `p` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be less than the new value of `n`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`**
