Example Answer:
The value of `j` is increased by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a`, `j`, `p`, `tmp` are as described in the precondition. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[i]` is replaced with `p[j]`, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both updated to 1. `j` is increased by 1.**
