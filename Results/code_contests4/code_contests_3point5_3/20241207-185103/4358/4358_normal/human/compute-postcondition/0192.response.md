Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than 1, `n` is the sum of the first `n+1` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing converted values from strings, `j` is less than `n`, `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in `p`, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `tmp` is a temporary variable used for swapping values. `p[i]` is greater than `p[j`]***
