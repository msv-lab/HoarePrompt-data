Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 1, `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in `p`, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j] which is greater than the value of `p` at index `j`, if `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, then `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]` after executing the code `p[j] = tmp`***
