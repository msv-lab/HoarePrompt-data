According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty string. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` should be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
