Example Answer:
The value of `j` is increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the condition in the if-else block, `s` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `len(s) + 1, `b` appends 1 if s[j] == '1', otherwise `b` appends 0.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the condition in the if-else block, `s` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `len(s) + 1, `b` appends 1 if s[j] == '1', otherwise `b` appends 0**
