Postcondition: ***i is greater than 1, n is such that 1 is less than n, a is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, j is less than n, p is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in p, the list a may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop. If p[i] > p[j] and a[i][j] == 1 and a[j][i] == 1, then the value at index i of list a is set to 1, the value at index j of list a is set to 1, and p[j] is updated to match the value at index i in list p.***
