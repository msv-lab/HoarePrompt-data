Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than 1, `n` is the sum of the first `n+1` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing converted values from strings, `j` is less than `n`, `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in `p`, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `tmp` is the value of `p[i]`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j`, `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, and after the execution of the if statement, the values of `p[i]` and `p[j]` have been interchanged, as well as the values of `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` have been swapped.***
