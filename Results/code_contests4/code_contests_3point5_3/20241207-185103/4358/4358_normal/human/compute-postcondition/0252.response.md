According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 or greater. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 3 or greater, `s` is updated based on the value of `p[i]`**
