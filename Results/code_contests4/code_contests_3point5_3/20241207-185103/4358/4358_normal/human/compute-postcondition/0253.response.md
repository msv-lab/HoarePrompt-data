Example Answer:
The value of `p[i]` is concatenated with a space to the string `s`. The value of `i` is 3 or greater, so the value of `s` is updated based on the specific value of `p[i]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3 or greater, `s` is updated based on the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`i` is 3 or greater, `s` is updated based on the value of `p[i]`**
