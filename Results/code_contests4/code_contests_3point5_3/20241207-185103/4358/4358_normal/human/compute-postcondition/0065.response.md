Example Answer:
`b` is appended with the value 1. The previous state of `b` contains either 1 or 0. After appending 1, the new state of `b` will have an additional element at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 6, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b` appended with another list `b` with an additional element at the end based on the condition within the if else block, `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than the length of string `s`, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 depending on the condition, `s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 0.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 6, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b` appended with another list `b` with an additional element at the end based on the condition within the if else block, `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than the length of string `s`, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 depending on the condition, `s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 0**
