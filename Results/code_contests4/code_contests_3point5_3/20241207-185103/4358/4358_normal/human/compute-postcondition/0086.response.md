Example Answer:
`p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is the value of `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, after execution `p[j]` will have the same value as `p[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 1, `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` equals 1, `a[j][i]` equals 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i`, and `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 1, `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` equals 1, `a[j][i]` equals 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i`, `p[j]` is equal to `p[i]`**
