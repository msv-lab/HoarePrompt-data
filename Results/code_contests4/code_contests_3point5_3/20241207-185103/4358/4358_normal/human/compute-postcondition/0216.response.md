According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `n + 1`, `n`, `a`, `j`, `p`, `tmp` remain as described in the precondition**
