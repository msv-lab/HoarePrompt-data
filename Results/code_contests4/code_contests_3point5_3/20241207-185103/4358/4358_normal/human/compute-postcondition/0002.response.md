Example Answer:
The list `p` is assigned the mapped integer values from the input split by spaces. The input is taken from the user as raw input and split into integers. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `A` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
Output State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, where each character is either '0' or '1'**
