Example Answer:
`p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, where `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The conditions for the loop to execute again are not provided, so the output state is: `j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`.
Output State: **`j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`**
