Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and `i` is increased by 1, so after execution, `j` is one more than the new value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `n`, `a`, `j` is `i + 1`, `p`, `tmp` remain as described in the precondition.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `n`, `a`, `j` is `i + 1`, `p`, `tmp` remain as described in the precondition**
