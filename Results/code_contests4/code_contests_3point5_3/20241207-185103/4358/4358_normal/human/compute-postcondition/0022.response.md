Example Answer: 
After executing the code `b.append(1)`, the list `b` appends the value 1. The initial state of `b` was an empty list, so after execution, `b` will contain a single element which is 1. The other variables `i`, `a`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `len(s) + 1`, `b` contains the value 1, `s` is a non-empty string.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `len(s) + 1`, `b` contains the value 1, `s` is a non-empty string**
