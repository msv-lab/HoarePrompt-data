Example Answer:
The list `b` is appended to list `a`. The list `b` contains 1 or 0 based on the conditions in the if-else block for each character in string `s`. The loop has finished execution, and `j` has reached the length of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to the length of `s`, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the conditions in the if-else block for each character in `s`, `s` is a non-empty string.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to the length of `s`, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the conditions in the if-else block for each character in `s`, `s` is a non-empty string**
