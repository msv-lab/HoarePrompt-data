According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is increased by 1, `n`, `a`, `j` is `i + 1`, `p`, `tmp` remain as described in the precondition. Since `j` is `i + 1`, in order for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `j` is `i + 1`, `p`, `tmp` remain as described in the precondition**
