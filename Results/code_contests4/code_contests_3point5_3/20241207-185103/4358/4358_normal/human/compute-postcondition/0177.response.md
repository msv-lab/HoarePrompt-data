Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists containing converted values from strings, `j` is 3, `p` is updated and sorted in non-decreasing order, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `tmp` holds the value of the first element of the sorted list `p`. If `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then `p[j]` is assigned the value `tmp`.***
