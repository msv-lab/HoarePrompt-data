Example Answer:
Initially, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty string, and `n` is assumed to be greater than 0 to enter the loop. The code concatenates the string representation of `p[i]` (assuming `p` is a list) with a space to the string `s`. Since the value of `i` is 0, `p[0]` is accessed, and if `p[0]` is, for example, 5, then after execution, `s` will be '5 '. The value of `i` will remain 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `s` is '5 '.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is '5 '**
