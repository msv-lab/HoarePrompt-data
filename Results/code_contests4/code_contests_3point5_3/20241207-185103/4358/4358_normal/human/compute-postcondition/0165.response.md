Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 1, `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in `p`, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `tmp` is a temporary variable used for swapping values. The value of `p` at index `i` is greater than the value of `p` at index `j`***
