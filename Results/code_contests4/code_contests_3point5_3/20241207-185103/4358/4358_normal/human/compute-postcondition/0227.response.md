According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 and `i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `j` should be less than `n`.
State: **`i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `j` should be less than `n`**.
