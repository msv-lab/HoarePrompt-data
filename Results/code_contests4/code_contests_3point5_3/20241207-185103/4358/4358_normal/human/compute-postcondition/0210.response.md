Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `j` is incremented by 1, and then `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. The previous values of the variables are not specified, so the output state is: `i`, `n`, `a` are all incremented by 1, `p` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be less than the new value of `n`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a` are all incremented by 1, `p` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be less than the new value of `n`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`**
