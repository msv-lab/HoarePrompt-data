Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a` are all incremented by 1, `p` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than the new value of `n`. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` and `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.**
