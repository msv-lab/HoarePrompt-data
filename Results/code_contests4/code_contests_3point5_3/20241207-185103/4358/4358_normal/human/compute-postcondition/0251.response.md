Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The value of `s` is updated based on the value of `p[i]`, but the initial value of `p` is not given, so the specific value of `s` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `s` is updated based on the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is updated based on the value of `p[i]`**
