Example Answer:
The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The variables `i` and `j` have been incremented by 1 at the start, and `j` needs to be less than `n` by 1 for the loop to execute again. The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `p[i]` is the value of `p[j]`, and `tmp` holds the previous value of `p[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `a`, `j` increased by 1, `p` with updated values, `tmp` holds the previous value of `p[i]`, `j` is less than `n` by 1 for the loop to execute again**
