According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `n`, `a`, `j` increased by 1, `p`, `tmp` are as described in the precondition, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n` by 1**
