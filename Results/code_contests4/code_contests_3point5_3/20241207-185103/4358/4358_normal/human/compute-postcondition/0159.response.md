Example Answer:
The value of 'i' is incremented by 1. The previous value of 'i' is unknown, so after execution, 'i' will be increased by 1. The values of 'j', 'n', 'p', and 'tmp' remain unchanged.
Output State: **'i' is incremented by 1, 'j' is equal to 'n', 'n' is unchanged, 'p' is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'tmp' is a temporary variable used for swapping values**
