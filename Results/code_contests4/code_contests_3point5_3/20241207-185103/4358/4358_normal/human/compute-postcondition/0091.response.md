The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, which means `tmp` now holds the same value as `p[i]`. All other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 3, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` equals 1, `a[j][i]` equals 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[j]` is equal to `p[i`**
