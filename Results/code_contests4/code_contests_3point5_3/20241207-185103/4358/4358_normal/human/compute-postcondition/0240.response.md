Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `n`, `a` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1. `tmp` holds the initial value of `p[i]`. For the loop to execute again, `j` is less than `n`. If `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then the overall state of the program is maintained as described.
