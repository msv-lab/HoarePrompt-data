Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, where the previous value of `i` was increased by 6. Hence, after execution, `i` will be increased by 7. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 7, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to the length of string `s`, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `a` contains the appended list `b`.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 7, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to the length of string `s`, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `a` contains the appended list `b`**
