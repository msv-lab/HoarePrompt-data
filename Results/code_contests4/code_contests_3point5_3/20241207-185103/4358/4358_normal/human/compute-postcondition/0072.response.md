Postcondition: ***`i` is increased by 6, `a` is a list containing the values from list `b` appended with another list `b` with an additional element at the end based on the condition within the if else block, `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than the new length of string `s`, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 depending on the condition, `s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 0, `j` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is equal to '1', a new element with value 1 is appended to list `b`. Otherwise, `b` is appended with 0.***
