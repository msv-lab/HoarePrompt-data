Output State: **`i` is greater than 1, `n` is such that 1 is less than `n`, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is incremented by 1, `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in `p`, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop for the loop to execute again, `j` is less than `n`. If `p[i] > p[j]` and `a[i][j] == 1` and `a[j][i] == 1`, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j` is incremented by 1.**
