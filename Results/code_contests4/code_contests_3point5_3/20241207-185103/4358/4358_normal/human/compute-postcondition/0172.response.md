Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 2, `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in `p`, the list `a` may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `tmp` is a temporary variable used for swapping values. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, and `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, then `p[i]` is updated to the value of `p[j]` after swapping.**
