Example Answer:
`p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, where `tmp` is the value of `p[i]`. The loop condition is not specified, so the loop may or may not execute again. Therefore, the output state is: `j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[j]` is now equal to `tmp`.
Output State: **`j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[j]` is now equal to `tmp`**
