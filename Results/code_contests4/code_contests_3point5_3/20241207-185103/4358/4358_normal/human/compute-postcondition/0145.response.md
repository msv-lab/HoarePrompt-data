Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The value of `p[i]` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `tmp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`j+1` is less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` for the loop to execute again, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]**
