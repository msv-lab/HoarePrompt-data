Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. The value of `n` and `a` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings**
