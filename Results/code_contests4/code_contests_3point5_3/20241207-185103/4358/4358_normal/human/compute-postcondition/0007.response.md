Example Answer:
A new empty list `b` is created. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is an empty list.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is an empty list**
