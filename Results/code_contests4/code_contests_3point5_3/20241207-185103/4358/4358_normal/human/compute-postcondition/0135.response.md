According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is `i + 2`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be incremented again to update `j` accordingly. Additionally, `n` needs to be adjusted such that `j` is less than `n`. 
State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `j` is updated to `i + 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than `n`**
