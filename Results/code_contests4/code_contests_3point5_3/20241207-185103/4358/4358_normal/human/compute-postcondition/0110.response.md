Postcondition: ***i is greater than 1, n is such that 1 is less than n, a is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, j is less than n, p is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the values in p, the list a may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop. The value at index i in list p is greater than the value at index j in list p. Additionally, the value at index i of list a is equal to 1 and the value at index j of list a is equal to 1***
