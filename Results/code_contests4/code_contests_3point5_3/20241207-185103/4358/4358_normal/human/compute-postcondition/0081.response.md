According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is 1, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` and `n` should be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, `a` is a list of lists containing the converted values from strings, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than `n` and `n` is greater than 1**
