Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input permutation p and the matrix A, then iterates through the elements of p to check if there are any pairs that need to be swapped based on the conditions specified in the problem description. It then performs the swaps if necessary and prints the resulting permutation.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description to determine the prettiest permutation that can be obtained by swapping elements based on the values in the matrix A. It iterates through all possible pairs of elements in the permutation and checks if swapping them is allowed by the corresponding values in the matrix A. If swapping is allowed, it performs the swap.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
