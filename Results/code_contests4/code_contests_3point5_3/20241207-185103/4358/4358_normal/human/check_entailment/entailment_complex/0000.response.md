Correctness: **True**

The provided program reads the input data correctly, processes it according to the problem description, and outputs the prettiest permutation that can be obtained based on the given constraints. The program iterates through the permutation, checks the conditions for swapping elements based on the matrix values, and swaps the elements accordingly to achieve the prettiest permutation. Finally, it prints the prettiest permutation as required. The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
