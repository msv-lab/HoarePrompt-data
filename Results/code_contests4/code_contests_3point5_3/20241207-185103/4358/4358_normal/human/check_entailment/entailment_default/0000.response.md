Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input data and processes it to sort the values in list `p` in non-decreasing order using the matrix `A` to determine if swaps are allowed between elements. 
- The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement where a swap can only be performed if the corresponding element in the matrix `A` is 1. 
- The code iterates over all pairs of elements in the permutation `p` and performs the swap if the conditions are met. 
- Finally, the code prints the sorted values as a concatenated string separated by spaces, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code handles all potential cases correctly as specified in the problem description, ensuring that the prettiest permutation is obtained based on the constraints provided.
