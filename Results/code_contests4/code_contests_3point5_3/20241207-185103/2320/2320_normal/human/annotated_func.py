#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return a, 1, 0
        #The program returns variable 'a' and two integers 1 and 0. 'b' is an integer equal to 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `b` is equal to 0, the value of `b` is not equal to 0
    g, tmp_x, tmp_y = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
    return g, x, y
    #The program returns the values of 'g', 'x', and 'y' based on the calculations and assignments mentioned in the code snippet.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. In Case_1, if `b` is 0, it returns the value of `a` along with two integers 1 and 0. In Case_2, it recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (g), and the coefficients (x, y) of Bezout's identity for `a` and `b`. The function returns these values based on the calculations and assignments in the code snippet.
