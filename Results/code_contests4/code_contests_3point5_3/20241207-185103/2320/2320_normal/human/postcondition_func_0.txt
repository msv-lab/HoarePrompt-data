The function func_1 accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. In Case_1, if `b` is 0, it returns the value of `a` along with two integers 1 and 0. In Case_2, it recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (g), and the coefficients (x, y) of Bezout's identity for `a` and `b`. The function returns these values based on the calculations and assignments in the code snippet.
