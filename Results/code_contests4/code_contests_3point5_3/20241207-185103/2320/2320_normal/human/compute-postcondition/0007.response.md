The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is returned along with two integers 1 and 0 in Case_1, where `b` is an integer equal to 0. In Case_2, the function returns the values of variables 'g', 'x', and 'y' based on the calculations and assignments mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, and return different values based on the conditions specified in the two cases.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. In Case_1, it returns 'a' along with two integers 1 and 0 when `b` is 0. In Case_2, it returns the values of 'g', 'x', and 'y' based on calculations and assignments.**
