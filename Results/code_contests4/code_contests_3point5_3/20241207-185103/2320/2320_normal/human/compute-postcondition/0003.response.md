Example Answer:
`func_1` is called with the arguments `b` and `a % b`, and the returned values are assigned to `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y`. The previous value of `b` is 0, and `a % b` depends on the specific value of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is equal to 0, the value of `b` is not equal to 0; `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` are assigned values based on the return of `func_1`.
Output State: **`b` is equal to 0, the value of `b` is not equal to 0; `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` are assigned values based on the return of `func_1`**
