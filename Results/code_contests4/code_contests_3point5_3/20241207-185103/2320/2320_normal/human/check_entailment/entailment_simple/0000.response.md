Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers 'a' and 'b'. This algorithm is used to calculate the starting point for Vanya's path in the field in order to see as many apple trees as possible. The program follows the problem description by recursively calculating the coordinates of the cell from which Vanya should start his path.
