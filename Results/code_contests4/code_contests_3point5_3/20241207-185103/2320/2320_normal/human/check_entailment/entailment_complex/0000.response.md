Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a recursive function `func_1` that calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the coefficients of Bezout's identity for two given integers `a` and `b`. This function is not directly related to the problem description provided. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
