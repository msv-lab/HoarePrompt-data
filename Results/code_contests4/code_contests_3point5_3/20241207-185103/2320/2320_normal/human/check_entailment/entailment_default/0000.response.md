Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to follow the problem description for every potential case. It correctly reads the input and calculates the starting point based on the movements of Vanya. The function `func_1` also seems to correctly calculate the greatest common divisor and return the coefficients based on Bezout's identity. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code and further confirm that the code is correct. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
