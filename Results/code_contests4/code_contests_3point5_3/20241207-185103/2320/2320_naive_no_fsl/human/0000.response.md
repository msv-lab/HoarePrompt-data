Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the field size, number of apple trees, and Vanya's movement vector.
2. The program correctly calculates the coordinates of the cell from which Vanya should start his path to see as many apple trees as possible.
3. The program handles the movement of Vanya based on the given vector (dx, dy) and ensures that he ends his path when he reaches a square he has already visited.
4. The program outputs the coordinates of the cell from which Vanya should start his path, as required by the problem description.
5. The program iterates through all the apple tree coordinates and calculates the count of apple trees visible from each starting cell, then determines the starting cell with the maximum count of visible apple trees.

Overall, the program implements the logic as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
