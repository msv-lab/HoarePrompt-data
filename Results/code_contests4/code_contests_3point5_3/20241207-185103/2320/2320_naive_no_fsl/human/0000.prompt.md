You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vanya decided to walk in the field of size n × n cells. The field contains m apple trees, the i-th apple tree is at the cell with coordinates (xi, yi). Vanya moves towards vector (dx, dy). That means that if Vanya is now at the cell (x, y), then in a second he will be at cell <image>. The following condition is satisfied for the vector: <image>, where <image> is the largest integer that divides both a and b. Vanya ends his path when he reaches the square he has already visited. 

Vanya wonders, from what square of the field he should start his path to see as many apple trees as possible.

Input

The first line contains integers n, m, dx, dy(1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n) — the size of the field, the number of apple trees and the vector of Vanya's movement. Next m lines contain integers xi, yi (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1) — the coordinates of apples. One cell may contain multiple apple trees.

Output

Print two space-separated numbers — the coordinates of the cell from which you should start your path. If there are several answers you are allowed to print any of them.

Examples

Input

5 5 2 3
0 0
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 1


Output

1 3


Input

2 3 1 1
0 0
0 1
1 1


Output

0 0

Note

In the first sample Vanya's path will look like: (1, 3) - (3, 1) - (0, 4) - (2, 2) - (4, 0) - (1, 3)

In the second sample: (0, 0) - (1, 1) - (0, 0)
Program:
```
def func_1(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    (g, tmp_x, tmp_y) = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
    return (g, x, y)
(n, m, dx, dy) = map(int, raw_input().split())
count = [0] * n
for i in range(0, m):
    (x, y) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (g, t, k) = func_1(n, dy)
    k = -k * y
    rep_x = ((x + k * dx) % n + n) % n
    count[rep_x] = count[rep_x] + 1
ans_x = 0
for x in range(0, n):
    if count[x] > count[ans_x]:
        ans_x = x
print(ans_x, 0)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
