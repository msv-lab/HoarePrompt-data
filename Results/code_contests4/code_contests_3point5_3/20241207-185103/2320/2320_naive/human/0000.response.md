Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description. It does not handle the case where Vanya ends his path when he reaches the square he has already visited. The code only considers the number of apple trees seen from each square, but it does not take into account the condition of revisiting squares. Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases.
