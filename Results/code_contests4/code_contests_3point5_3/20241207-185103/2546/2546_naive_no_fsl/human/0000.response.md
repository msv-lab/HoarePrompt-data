Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only checks for specific combinations of syllables (5-5-7, 5-7-5, 7-5-5) and prints 'YES' for those combinations only. However, the problem description states that the order should be 5-7-5. The program does not cover all possible valid combinations, such as 5-5-7, 7-5-5, or 7-7-5. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
