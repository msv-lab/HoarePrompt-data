Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to construct a Haiku by using each of the phrases once, in some order. It checks if the input values match the specific combinations required for a Haiku (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), or (7, 5, 5) and prints 'YES' if any of these conditions are met. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program covers all possible valid combinations and ensures that it follows the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.
