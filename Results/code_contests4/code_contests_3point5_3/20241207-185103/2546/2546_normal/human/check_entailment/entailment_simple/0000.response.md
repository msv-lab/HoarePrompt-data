Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to construct a Haiku by using each of the phrases once, in some order. It checks all possible combinations of the number of syllables in the three phrases and prints 'YES' if a valid Haiku can be constructed, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program covers all cases as specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
