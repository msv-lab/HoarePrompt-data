Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes input for three integers a, b, and c and checks if they match specific values (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), or (7, 5, 5) in any order. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The code covers all possible valid combinations of syllable counts for a Haiku (5, 5, 7) and (7, 5, 5) and correctly outputs 'YES' in those cases. Since the code follows the problem description for all potential valid cases, the correctness is True.
