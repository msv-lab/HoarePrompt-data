The function `func` takes input from the user for three integers a, b, and c. It then checks if a, b, and c match specific values (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), or (7, 5, 5) in any order and prints 'YES' if any of these conditions are met. If none of the conditions are satisfied, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on the user input within the given constraints.
