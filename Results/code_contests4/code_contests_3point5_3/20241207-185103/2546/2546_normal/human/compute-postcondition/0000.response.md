Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained by converting the input values from `raw_input().split()` to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of A, B, and C are between 1 and 10. Therefore, after execution, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 1 and 10.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 1 and 10**
