Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 1 and 10. The values of `a` and `b` are not equal to 5, or the value of `c` is not equal to 7. The values of `a` and `b` are not both 5 and 7, or `c` is not equal to 5. The values of `a` and `b` are not 7 and 5, or `c` is not 5. If `a` is 5, `b` is 7, and `c` is 5, then 'YES' is printed. If `a` is 7, `b` is 5, and `c` is 5, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the original conditions are maintained.***
