Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads an integer input `q` from each line until it encounters -1, which is in line with the problem description.
- It initializes `x` to be `q/2.0` as instructed.
- It then calculates the cube root approximation using the recurrence formula provided in the problem description.
- The program stops the calculation when the condition `abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff` is met, where `diff` is set to `q * 1e-05`.
- The output is formatted correctly to display the result with an error margin of 0.00001.
- The program handles multiple datasets and terminates when -1 is encountered, as specified in the problem description.
- Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
