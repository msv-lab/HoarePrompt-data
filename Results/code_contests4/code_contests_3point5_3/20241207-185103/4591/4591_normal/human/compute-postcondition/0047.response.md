Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `q / 2.0`. If `q` is not equal to -1, the value of `x` will be half of `q`. The program will then continue to calculate the approximate cube root of `q` based on the value of `x`. If `q` is -1, the program will terminate without any further calculations.
Output State: **If `q` is not -1, `x` is half of `q`.**
