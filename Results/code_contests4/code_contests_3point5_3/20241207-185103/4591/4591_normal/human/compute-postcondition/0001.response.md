Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value `int(line)`, where `line` is read from stdin and converted to an integer. The value of `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31**
