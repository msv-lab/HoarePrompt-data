Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is updated based on the given formula. The value of `q` is not provided in the initial state, so it is unknown. The output state after running the code is that `x` is updated according to the formula, but the exact value depends on the initial value of `x` and `q`.
Output State: **`x` is updated according to the formula, but the exact value depends on the initial value of `x` and `q`**
