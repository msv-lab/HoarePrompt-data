Output State: **`q` is either -1 or not -1, if `q` is not -1, `x` will be updated based on the formula, `diff` will be updated accordingly. If `q` is -1, `x` is not defined, `diff` remains 0. The loop will break when the absolute value of the difference between `x` cubed and `q` is less than `diff`.**
