Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `q` divided by 2.0. Since `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` will be half of `q`. The value of `diff` is calculated as `q` multiplied by 1e-05. If `q` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is half of `q`, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05. If q == -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is half of `q`, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05. If q == -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
