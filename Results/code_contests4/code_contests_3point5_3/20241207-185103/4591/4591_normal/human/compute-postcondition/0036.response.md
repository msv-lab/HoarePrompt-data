Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is updated based on the given expression, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05. If the absolute value of the cube of `x` minus `q` is less than `diff`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
