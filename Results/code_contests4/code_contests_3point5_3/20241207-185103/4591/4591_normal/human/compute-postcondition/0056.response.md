Example Answer: 
The code `break` is used outside of a loop or switch statement, which results in a syntax error. The program cannot break out of a loop that does not exist. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state: No adjustments needed as it is a while True loop.
Output State: **No adjustments needed as it is a while True loop**
