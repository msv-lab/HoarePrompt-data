Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from stdin, calculates the approximate cube root of a positive integer `q`, and prints the result formatted to 6 decimal places. It continues this process until `-1` is entered as input. The function does not accept any parameters and iterates indefinitely until the break condition is met. If input is not a positive integer or `-1`, the behavior is not specified. **
