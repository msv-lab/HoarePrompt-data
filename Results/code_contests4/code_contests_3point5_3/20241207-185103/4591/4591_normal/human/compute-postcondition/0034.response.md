Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated based on the given expression. The value of `diff` is calculated as `q` multiplied by 1e-05. The new value of `x` is based on the formula provided in the code snippet. 
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is updated based on the given expression, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05**
