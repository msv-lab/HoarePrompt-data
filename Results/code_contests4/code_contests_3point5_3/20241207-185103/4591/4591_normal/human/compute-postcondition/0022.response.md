According to the code, the loop will execute for each line in the input until there are no more lines to read from the standard input. Since the loop is reading lines from standard input, the state variables `q`, `x`, and `diff` will remain the same after each iteration unless modified within the loop body.

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31. To execute the loop one more time, the state remains the same as the loop is not dependent on `q` for termination.

State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is the calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05**
