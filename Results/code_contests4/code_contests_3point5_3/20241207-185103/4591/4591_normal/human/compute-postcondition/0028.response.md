Since the loop condition is `while True`, the loop will certainly execute one time. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is half of `q`, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05**
