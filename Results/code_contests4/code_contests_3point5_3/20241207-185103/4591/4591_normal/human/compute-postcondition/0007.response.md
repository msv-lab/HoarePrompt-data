Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will run indefinitely until explicitly broken out of within the loop body. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute one time. No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, x is the value of q divided by 2.0, diff is the value of q multiplied by 1e-05**
