Postcondition: ***q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, x is the value of q divided by 2.0, and diff is the value of q multiplied by 1e-05. If the absolute difference between x raised to the power of 3 and q is less than diff, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
