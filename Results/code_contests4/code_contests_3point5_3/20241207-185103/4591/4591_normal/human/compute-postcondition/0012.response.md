According to the code, the loop will continue indefinitely since it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, we simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, x is the value of q divided by 2.0, diff is the value of q multiplied by 1e-05. If the absolute difference between x raised to the power of 3 and q is less than diff, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
