Example Answer:
The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05. If `q` is not -1, then `x` is half of `q`. Therefore, if `q` is not -1, `diff` will be equal to half of `q` multiplied by 1e-05. If `q` is -1, then `x` is not defined and `diff` will be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: If `q` is not -1, `x` is half of `q`, `diff` is calculated accordingly. If `q` is -1, `x` is not defined, `diff` is 0.
Output State: **If `q` is not -1, `x` is half of `q`, `diff` is calculated accordingly. If `q` is -1, `x` is not defined, `diff` is 0**
