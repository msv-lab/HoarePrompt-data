Example Answer:
If `q` is not -1, `x` is updated by the formula provided. If `q` is -1, `x` is not defined, and `diff` remains 0. The output state will depend on the value of `q` and the previous values of `x` and `diff`.
Output State: **If `q` is not -1, `x` and `diff` will be updated based on the formula. If `q` is -1, `x` is not defined, and `diff` remains 0.**
