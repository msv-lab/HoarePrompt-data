Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `x` formatted to 6 decimal places. The initial state states that `x` is the approximate cube root of `q`, which means `x` is a floating-point number. Therefore, the code will print the value of `x` with 6 decimal places.
Output State: **The code will output the approximate cube root of `q` formatted to 6 decimal places.**
