Example Answer:
`x` is updated by subtracting the result of the expression `(x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)` from its current value. The value of `q` is not directly used in this calculation, so it remains the same. The value of `x` was initially half of `q`, so after the calculation, `x` is adjusted accordingly. The variable `diff` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is updated based on the given expression, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is updated based on the given expression, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05**
