According to the code, the `while True` loop will execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. In this case, the loop will terminate if the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is updated based on the given expression, and `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. Update the value of `x` based on the given expression.
2. Make sure that the absolute difference between the cube of the updated `x` and `q` is not less than `diff`.

State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is updated based on the given expression, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05**.
