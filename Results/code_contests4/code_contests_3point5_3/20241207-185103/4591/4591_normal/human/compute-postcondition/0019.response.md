Postcondition: ***q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, x is the new value after updating it with the given formula, diff is the value of q multiplied by 1e-05, loop will repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. If the absolute value of x cubed minus q is less than diff, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
