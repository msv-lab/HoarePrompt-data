Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value `int(line)`, where `line` is read from standard input and converted to an integer. The code will output the approximate cube root of `q` formatted to 6 decimal places. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line available to read from standard input.
Output State: **`q` is assigned the value of the integer input read from standard input, the code will output the approximate cube root of `q` formatted to 6 decimal places. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line available to read from standard input.**
