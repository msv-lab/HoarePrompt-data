Postcondition: ***`x` is updated according to the formula, but the exact value depends on the initial value of `x` and `q`. If abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff, `x` is updated according to the formula and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of `x` and the program continues as usual.***
