Since the while loop condition is `while True`, the loop will execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop. Therefore, in this case, the loop will certainly execute one time without any adjustments needed to the program state right before the loop.

State: **If `q` is not -1, `x` is half of `q`, `diff` is calculated accordingly. If `q` is -1, `x` is not defined, `diff` is 0**
