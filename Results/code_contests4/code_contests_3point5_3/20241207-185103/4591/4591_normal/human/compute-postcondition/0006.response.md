Example Answer:
`diff` is assigned the value `q * 1e-05`, where `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31. If `q` == -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is assigned the value of q divided by 2.0. Therefore, the Output State is: q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, x is the value of q divided by 2.0, diff is the value of q multiplied by 1e-05.
Output State: **q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, x is the value of q divided by 2.0, diff is the value of q multiplied by 1e-05**
