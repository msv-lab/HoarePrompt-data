Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a positive integer q as input, initializes x to q/2.0, and then iterates using the recurrence formula until the condition abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff is met. It stops the calculation when the value of |x ** 3 - q| becomes small enough and prints the result formatted to 6 decimal places. The program handles multiple datasets until -1 is entered as input, as specified in the problem description. The program meets all the requirements and produces the correct output as expected.
