You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The solution of $ x ^ 3 = q $ is to calculate the recurrence formula $ x_ {n + 1} = x_n-\ frac {x_ {n} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {n} ^ 2} $ It can be calculated approximately with.

Put a positive number $ \ frac {q} {2} $ in $ x_1 $

$ x_2 = x_1-\ frac {x_ {1} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {1} ^ 2} $, $ x_3 = x_2-\ frac {x_ {2} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {2} ^ Calculate as 2} $,â€¦.

While doing this calculation

When the value of $ | x ^ 3 --q | $ becomes small enough, stop the calculation and use the last calculated $ x_n $ as an approximate solution of $ x ^ 3 = q $.

Follow this method to create a program that outputs an approximation of the cube root of $ q $ for the input positive integer $ q $. However, use $ | x ^ 3-q | <0.00001 q $ to determine that it is "small enough".



input

Multiple datasets are given. For each dataset, $ q $ ($ 1 \ leq q <2 ^ {31} $) (integer) is given on one line. The end of the input is -1.

The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

output

Print $ x $ (real number) on one line for each dataset. The output result may contain an error of 0.00001 or less.

Example

Input

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31.
def func():
    for line in stdin:
        q = int(line)
        
        if q == -1:
            break
        
        x = q / 2.0
        
        diff = q * 1e-05
        
        while True:
            x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)
            if abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff:
                break
        
        print('{:.6f}'.format(x))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `q` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is the approximate cube root of `q` formatted to 6 decimal places, `diff` is the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from stdin, calculates the approximate cube root of a positive integer `q`, and prints the result formatted to 6 decimal places. It continues this process until `-1` is entered as input. The function does not accept any parameters and iterates indefinitely until the break condition is met. If input is not a positive integer or `-1`, the behavior is not specified.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
