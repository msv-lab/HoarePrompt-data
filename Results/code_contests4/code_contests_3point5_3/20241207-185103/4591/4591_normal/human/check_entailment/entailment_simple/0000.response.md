Correctness: **True**

The provided program follows the problem description accurately. It calculates the approximation of the cube root of q using the given recurrence formula and stops the calculation when the condition $ | x ^ 3 - q | < 0.00001 q $ is met. The program correctly outputs the approximate value of x for each dataset. It handles multiple datasets until -1 is encountered as the end of input.

Therefore, the program is correct as it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
