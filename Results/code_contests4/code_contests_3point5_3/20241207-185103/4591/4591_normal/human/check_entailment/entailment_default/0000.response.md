Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads input from stdin and calculates the approximate cube root of a positive integer q as described in the problem statement.
- It uses the given recurrence formula to approximate the cube root of q until the condition `abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff` is met.
- The program stops the calculation when the value of `| x ** 3 - q |` becomes small enough, which is defined as `<0.00001 q`.
- The output is formatted to 6 decimal places and printed for each dataset.
- The code seems to follow the problem description accurately for all potential cases and the output hints align with the code's functionality.
