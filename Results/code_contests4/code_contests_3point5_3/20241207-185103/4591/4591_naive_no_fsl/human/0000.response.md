Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program accurately follows the problem description by implementing the recurrence formula to calculate an approximation of the cube root of a given positive integer q. It correctly checks the condition for stopping the calculation when |x^3 - q| < 0.00001q. The program iterates through each dataset, calculates the approximation, and prints the result with a precision of 6 decimal places. The program handles multiple datasets until it encounters -1 as the input, as specified in the problem description. Overall, the program meets all the requirements and produces the expected output for the given problem statement.
