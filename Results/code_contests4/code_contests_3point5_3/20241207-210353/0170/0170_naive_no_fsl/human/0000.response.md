Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not generate a sequence p that satisfies the given conditions. The logic in the function `func_19()` to generate the sequence p is incorrect. The sequence p generated by the program violates the condition that no two adjacent elements should have equal values. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
