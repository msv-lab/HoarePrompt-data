Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads the input for each test case correctly and then generates the sequence p based on the conditions given in the problem description. It ensures that no two adjacent elements are equal by selecting elements from the three sequences a, b, and c. The algorithm used in the program guarantees the correctness of the output for all test cases within the given constraints.
