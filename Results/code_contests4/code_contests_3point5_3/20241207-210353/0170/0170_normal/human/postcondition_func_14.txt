The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs a series of calculations on `x` and `y` based on the conditions within the loop until `y` becomes 0. The function then returns the updated value of `res`. The loop iterates through the binary representation of `y`, updating `res`, `x`, and `y` accordingly. The function does not handle edge cases where `p` is 0, negative, or not provided as it might lead to division by zero errors or incorrect results.
