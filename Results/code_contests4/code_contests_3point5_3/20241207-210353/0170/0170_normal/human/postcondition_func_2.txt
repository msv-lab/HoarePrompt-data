The function func_3 reads t test cases, each containing an integer n and three sequences of n integers. It then extracts these integers from the input by stripping and splitting by space, returning a map object. The function does not enforce the constraints of 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100, and the conditions a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i described in the annotation.
