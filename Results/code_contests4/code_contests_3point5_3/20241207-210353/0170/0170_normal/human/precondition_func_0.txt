**Precondition**: The input consists of t test cases where each test case contains three sequences of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n), and (c_1, c_2, ..., c_n) such that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i. The value of n is between 3 and 100, and the values of a_i, b_i, and c_i are between 1 and 100.
