The function `func_13` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `r`, and calculates the result of the combination calculation using these values by utilizing the factorial function. The calculated result is returned by the function. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `r` are negative as factorial calculations are not defined for negative integers. Additionally, the function does not account for potential errors that might occur during the factorial calculation, such as overflow errors for large values of `n` and `r`.
