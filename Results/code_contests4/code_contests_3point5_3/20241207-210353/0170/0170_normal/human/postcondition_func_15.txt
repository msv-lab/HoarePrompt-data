The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and iteratively calculates the final value of `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. The function then returns the last calculated value of `x % y`, which is the value that `x` holds after the modulo operation with `y`. `y` is updated to 0 after the operation.
