** The input consists of t test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the sequences, followed by three lines containing n integers each representing the sequences a, b, and c respectively. Each integer a_i, b_i, c_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) is such that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.
