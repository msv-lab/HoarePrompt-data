The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` within the range 3 <= n <= 100. It checks various conditions and returns True or False based on those conditions. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns False. If n equals 3, it returns True. If n is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns False. It then checks if n is a prime number by iterating through a loop. If the loop finishes execution and n is a prime number, it returns True. The function returns different values depending on the specified conditions. It does not return what the annotations suggest for some cases, indicating potential discrepancies between the code and annotations.
