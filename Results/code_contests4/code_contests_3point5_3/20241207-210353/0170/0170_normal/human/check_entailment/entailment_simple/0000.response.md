Correctness: **True**

The annotated program follows the problem description accurately. It takes input for multiple test cases, each containing three sequences of integers. It then generates a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_n based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program ensures that each element in the sequence p is chosen from the corresponding elements in the input sequences a, b, and c, and that no two adjacent elements are equal.

The program correctly loops through the elements of the input sequences, compares them, and assigns values to the output sequence accordingly. It then prints the final sequence for each test case.

The functions in the program are well-defined and perform the necessary operations to achieve the desired output. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
