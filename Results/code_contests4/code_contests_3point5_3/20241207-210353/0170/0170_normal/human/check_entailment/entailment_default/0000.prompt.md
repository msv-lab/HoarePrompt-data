You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three sequences: a_1, a_2, …, a_n; b_1, b_2, …, b_n; c_1, c_2, …, c_n.

For each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.

Find a sequence p_1, p_2, …, p_n, that satisfy the following conditions:

  * p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}
  * p_i ≠ p_{(i mod n) + 1}.



In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements i,i+1 adjacent for i<n and also elements 1 and n) will have equal value.

It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100): the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100): the number of elements in the given sequences.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains n integers c_1, c_2, …, c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.

Output

For each test case, print n integers: p_1, p_2, …, p_n (p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}, p_i ≠ p_{i mod n + 1}).

If there are several solutions, you can print any.

1 2 3
1 2 1 2
1 3 4 3 2 4 2
1 3 2
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2

Note

In the first test case p = [1, 2, 3].

It is a correct answer, because:

  * p_1 = 1 = a_1, p_2 = 2 = b_2, p_3 = 3 = c_3 
  * p_1 ≠ p_2 , p_2 ≠ p_3 , p_3 ≠ p_1 



All possible correct answers to this test case are: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].

In the second test case p = [1, 2, 1, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = a_3, p_4 = a_4. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.

In the third test case p = [1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = b_3, p_4 = b_4, p_5 = b_5, p_6 = c_6, p_7 = c_7. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function `func_1` processes t test cases where each test case contains three sequences of n integers and returns an integer value obtained from the input. The function accepts no parameters. The preconditions state that the input consists of t test cases with specific constraints on the sequences of integers. However, the actual function does not process any test cases or sequences as indicated by the annotations. It simply returns an integer value obtained from the input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns the input provided by the user. This means that the program will wait for user input and return whatever the user inputs.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function func_3 reads t test cases, each containing an integer n and three sequences of n integers. It then extracts these integers from the input by stripping and splitting by space, returning a map object.

Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It processes an input string by splitting it into elements, then converts these elements to strings and returns a map object containing the converted elements. The function does not consider the initial conditions mentioned in the annotations regarding the range of `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i`. It solely focuses on processing the input string.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():

    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread targeting the `main` function, and starts the thread. It does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value. The purpose of the function is to initialize certain settings and create a new thread for further operations based on the provided preconditions.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function func_7 accepts a list 'item' as a parameter and returns the second item from the list. The function does not consider any edge cases or missing functionality as it directly returns the second item from the input list without any conditions.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function func_8 accepts a list 'l' and returns the list sorted in reverse order based on the custom key function 'getKey'.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function func_9 accepts three parameters: n, m, and num. It returns a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers representing the elements of the sequences, repeated m times. The function assumes the input parameters n and m fall within the specified ranges.
Function number 10 :

 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
'''

Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function func_12 accepts a parameter `n` and converts each character in the string representation of `n` into an integer, returning a list of these integers.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `r`, and calculates the result of the combination calculation using these values by utilizing the factorial function. The calculated result is returned by the function. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `r` are negative as factorial calculations are not defined for negative integers. Additionally, the function does not account for potential errors that might occur during the factorial calculation, such as overflow errors for large values of `n` and `r`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts two parameters: `x`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `y`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers a, b, c such that a != b, a != c, and b != c. The function then performs two different calculations based on the input parameters: 
- Case_1: If x is divisible by y, it returns the integer value of x divided by y.
- Case_2: If x is not divisible by y, it returns the result of the division of x by y plus 1.

    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:

        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs a series of calculations on `x` and `y` based on the conditions within the loop until `y` becomes 0. The function then returns the updated value of `res`. The loop iterates through the binary representation of `y`, updating `res`, `x`, and `y` accordingly. The function does not handle edge cases where `p` is 0, negative, or not provided as it might lead to division by zero errors or incorrect results.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and iteratively calculates the final value of `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. The function then returns the last calculated value of `x % y`, which is the value that `x` holds after the modulo operation with `y`. `y` is updated to 0 after the operation.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''

            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` within the range 3 <= n <= 100. It checks various conditions and returns True or False based on those conditions. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns False. If n equals 3, it returns True. If n is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns False. It then checks if n is a prime number by iterating through a loop. If the loop finishes execution and n is a prime number, it returns True. The function returns different values depending on the specified conditions. It does not return what the annotations suggest for some cases, indicating potential discrepancies between the code and annotations.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
