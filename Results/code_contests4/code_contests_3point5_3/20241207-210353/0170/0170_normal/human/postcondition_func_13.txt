The function `func_14` accepts two parameters: `x`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `y`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers a, b, c such that a != b, a != c, and b != c. The function then performs two different calculations based on the input parameters: 
- Case_1: If x is divisible by y, it returns the integer value of x divided by y.
- Case_2: If x is not divisible by y, it returns the result of the division of x by y plus 1.
