Since the loop executes based on the return value of `func_1()`, we need to focus on the behavior of `func_1()` to determine the next state. After the previous iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the list `ans` have not been altered. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the return value of `func_1()`. Without knowing the specifics of `func_1()`, we cannot determine the exact value it will return for the next iteration.

State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values from `func_1()` and `func_5()**.
