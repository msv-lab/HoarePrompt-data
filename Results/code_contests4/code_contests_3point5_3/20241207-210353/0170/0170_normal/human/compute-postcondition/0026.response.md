Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of functions, and `i` is incremented by 1. The specific values returned by `func_1()` and `func_5()` are unknown, but `ans` list is updated based on the condition mentioned above. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of functions, `ans` list is updated based on conditions, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of functions, `ans` list is updated based on conditions, `i` is incremented by 1**
