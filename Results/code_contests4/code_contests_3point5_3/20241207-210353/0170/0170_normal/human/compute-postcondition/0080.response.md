Output State: **`b`, `c` are lists of integers, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where each element is equal to the corresponding element of `a`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, for the loop to execute one more time the conditions for updating `ans[i]` based on `a`, `b`, and `c` must be met for the next iteration**
