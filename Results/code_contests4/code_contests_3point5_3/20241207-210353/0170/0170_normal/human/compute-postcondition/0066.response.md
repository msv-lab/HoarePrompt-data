Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, which means the value returned by `func_5()` is stored in `c`. The initial state does not provide information about the return value of `func_5()`, so the output state is: `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`.
Output State: **`b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`**
