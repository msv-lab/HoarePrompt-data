Example Answer:
The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values based on the `pop` method from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the keys 'sep' and 'file' exist in `kwargs`, their corresponding values are assigned to `sep` and `file`, otherwise, ' ' and `sys.stdout` are used as default values respectively. Since no initial state is provided, we can assume that `kwargs` is an empty dictionary. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ' and `file` is `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ' and `file` is `sys.stdout`**
