Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, where `i` iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. The initial state tells us that `ans` is a list of `n` zeros and `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. Additionally, `b` and `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`. The loop executes for `n` greater than or equal to 2 and ensures that the element at index `i-1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`. 
Output State: **`b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where each element is equal to the corresponding element of `a`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`, ensuring that `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]` and the condition for `ans[i-1] != a[i]` is satisfied.**
