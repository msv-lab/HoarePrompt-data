Postcondition: ***`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_5()`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values from `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]` from `func_5()`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 1. Additionally, in the loop, if the previous element in `ans` is not equal to the corresponding element in `a`, then the if condition is true.***
