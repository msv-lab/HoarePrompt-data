According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, the initial state can be adjusted to ensure the loop execution as follows:
State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_5()`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values from `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]` from `func_5()`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 1**.
