Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. The specific values of `a` and `ans` are not given, so we cannot determine the specific value of `ans[i]`. The loop will execute another time as `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` have specific values, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `c` have specific values, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time**
