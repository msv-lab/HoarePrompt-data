Example Answer: 
The list `ans` is initialized with `n` number of zeros. The values of `b` and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5() and `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
Output State: **`b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5() and `ans` is a list of `n` zeros**
