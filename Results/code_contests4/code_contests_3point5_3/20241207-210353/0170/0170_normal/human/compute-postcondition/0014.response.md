According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `args` list. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, args list has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in args. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 3 elements in the `args` list, and `x` should be the third element in the list.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, args list has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in args, a space ' ' is written to the output if `at_start` is False, `file.write(str(x))` is executed**
