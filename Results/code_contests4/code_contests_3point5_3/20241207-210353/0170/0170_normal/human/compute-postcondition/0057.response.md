Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans`, `i + 1` have specific values. If `ans[i]` is not equal to `a[i+1]`, then `ans[i+1]` is updated with the value of `b[i+1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i+1]` is updated with the value of `c[i+1]` at index `i+1`. `i` is incremented by 1. `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `c[i]`.**
