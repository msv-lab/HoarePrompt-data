Postcondition: ***`b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2. In the loop iteration, `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`. In the loop iteration, the value of `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`***
