Output State: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their original values from `func_1()` and `func_5()`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements where each element is updated based on the conditions in the loop. After all iterations, `ans` will be updated according to the conditions in the loop for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
