Postcondition: ***`b`, `c` are lists of integers, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where each element is equal to the corresponding element of `a`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`, ensuring that `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]` if `ans[i-1] != a[i]`, otherwise, `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `b[i]` if `ans[i-1] != b[i]` or with the value of `c[i]` if the previous condition is not met.***
