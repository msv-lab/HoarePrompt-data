Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_5()`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values from `func_5()`. `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]` from `func_5()`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute the condition (ans[i - 1] != a[i]) is false, implying that ans[i - 1] is equal to a[i]. The condition (ans[i - 1] != b[i]) is true. After the assignment `ans[i] = b[i]`, the value of `ans[i]` is updated to the value of `b[i]`.**
