According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the list `ans` contains values from either `a` or `b` or `c` based on the conditions met during each iteration. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0.
