Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans`, `i + 1` have specific values. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `a[i]` and `i` is incremented by 1. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `c[i]` or `b[i]` based on the values at index `i`.***
