Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are lists of integers. `ans` is a list where each element is equal to the corresponding element of `a`, with `ans[0]` assigned the value of `a[0]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to be equal to `a[i]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to be equal to either `b[i]` or `c[i]`, depending on the condition checking.***
