Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` are retained from `func_5()`. The specific values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` are unknown, but `n` now holds the value returned by `func_1()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values from `func_5()`.
Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values from `func_5()`**
