Example Answer: 
The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of the variable `x` to the output file. The initial state indicates that a space ' ' is written to the output if `at_start` is False. Since `at_start` is False, a space ' ' is written before the value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, args list has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in args, a space is written to the output, value of `x` is written to the output.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, args list has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in args, a space is written to the output, value of `x` is written to the output**
