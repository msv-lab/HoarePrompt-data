Output State: At the end of the loop, `a`, `b`, `c` will retain their original values from `func_5()`. `n` will be the value returned by `func_1()`. `ans` will be a list of length `n` where each element is determined based on the comparisons between the elements of `a`, `b`, and `c` at each index during the loop iterations.
