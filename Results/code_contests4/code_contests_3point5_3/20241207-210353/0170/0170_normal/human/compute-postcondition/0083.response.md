Postcondition: ***`b`, `c` are lists of integers, `ans` is a list where each element is equal to the corresponding element of `a`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, the conditions for updating `ans[i]` based on `a`, `b`, and `c` must be met for the next iteration.***
