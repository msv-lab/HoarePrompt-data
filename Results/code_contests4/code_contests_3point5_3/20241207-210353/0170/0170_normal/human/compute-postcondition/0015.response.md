Example Answer: 
`file.write(sep)` writes a space ' ' to the output file. The initial state specifies that `sep` is ' ', so a space is written. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, args list has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in args, a space ' ' is written to the output if `at_start` is False, `file.write(str(x))` is executed.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, args list has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in args, a space ' ' is written to the output if `at_start` is False, `file.write(str(x))` is executed**
