Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_1()` and `func_5()`, `ans` list is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. All other variables retain their original values.***
