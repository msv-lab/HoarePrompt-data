Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`, where `i` is the index that is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` have specific values, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `c` have specific values, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`**
