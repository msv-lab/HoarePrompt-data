Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are lists of integers. `ans` is a list where each element is equal to the corresponding element of `a`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to be equal to `b[i]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to be equal to `c[i]`.***
