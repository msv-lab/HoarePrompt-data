Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans`, `i + 1` have specific values. If `ans[i]` is not equal to `a[i+1]`, then `ans[i+1]` is updated with the value of `b[i+1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i+1]` is updated with the value of `c[i+1]` at index `i+1`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `c[i]`.***
