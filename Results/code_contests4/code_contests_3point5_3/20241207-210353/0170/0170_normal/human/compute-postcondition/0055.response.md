Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is the current index. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` have specific values, `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `c` have specific values, `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
