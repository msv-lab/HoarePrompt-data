According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute as the range starts from 1. Before the loop starts, `b` and `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, and `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `b` and `c` should have valid return values from `func_5()`, `ans` must be a list of `n` zeros, and `ans[0]` should have a valid value from `a[0]`.
State: **`b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
