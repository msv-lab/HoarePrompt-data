Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, and the values of `b`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The specific value returned by `func_5()` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_5()`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values from `func_5()`.
Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_5()`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values from `func_5()`**
