Functionality: **The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It iterates through the elements in `args`, writing each element to the output stream separated by a space ' '. After writing all elements, it writes a newline character '\n' by default. If the 'flush' key is present in the keyword arguments and set to True, the output is flushed. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
