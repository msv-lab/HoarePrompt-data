Postcondition: ***`b`, `c` are lists of integers, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element assigned the value of `a[0]`. The loop iterates over `n` where `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, if `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `c[i]`.***
