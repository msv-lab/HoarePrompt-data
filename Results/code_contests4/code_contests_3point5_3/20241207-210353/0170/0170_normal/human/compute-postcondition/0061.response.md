Example Answer:
The function `func_20` is called with the arguments unpacked from the list `ans`. The values in `ans` will determine the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` that will be used in the function. The final values of `ans` will depend on the conditions inside the function and how they compare to the previous values in `ans`. The values of `n` and `i` will not be affected by this function call. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `ans` will be a list containing values from either `a` or `b` or `c` based on the conditions met during each iteration.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `ans` will be a list containing values from either `a` or `b` or `c` based on the conditions met during each iteration.**
