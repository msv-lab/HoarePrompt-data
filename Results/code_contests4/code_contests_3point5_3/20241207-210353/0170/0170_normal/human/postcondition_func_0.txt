The function `func_1` processes t test cases where each test case contains three sequences of n integers and returns an integer value obtained from the input. The function accepts no parameters. The preconditions state that the input consists of t test cases with specific constraints on the sequences of integers. However, the actual function does not process any test cases or sequences as indicated by the annotations. It simply returns an integer value obtained from the input.
