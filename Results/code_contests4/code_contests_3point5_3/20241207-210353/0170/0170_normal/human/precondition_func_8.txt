**Precondition**: **n is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is an integer representing the number of elements in the sequences (3 ≤ m ≤ 100), num is a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers representing the elements of the sequences (1 ≤ num[i][j] ≤ 100).**
