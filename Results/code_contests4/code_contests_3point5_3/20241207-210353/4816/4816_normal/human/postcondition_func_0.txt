The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `N` and `NUMBERS`. `N` is converted to an integer, and `NUMBERS` is converted to a list of integers. The function calculates the sum of all elements in `NUMBERS`, then subtracts this sum from the sum of integers from 1 to `N`. The result is then printed to the console. The function does not explicitly return any value.
