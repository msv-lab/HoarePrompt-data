Example Answer:
The value of n is used to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2. Then, the difference between this sum and the current sum is calculated and converted to an integer. The result is then written to the standard output. Therefore, the Output State is: NUMBERS is a list with at least 1 element, sum is the sum of all elements in the list, n is the value of the last element in the list.
Output State: **NUMBERS is a list with at least 1 element, sum is the sum of all elements in the list, n is the value of the last element in the list**
