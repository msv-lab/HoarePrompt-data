Example Answer:
The list `numbers` is created by splitting the string `NUMBERS` using the space as a delimiter and converting each element to an integer. As all elements in `NUMBERS` are distinct, the resulting list `numbers` will contain unique integers. The value of `n` remains the same as `N`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and N, and all elements in NUMBERS are distinct; n is assigned the value of N.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and N, and all elements in NUMBERS are distinct; n is assigned the value of N**
