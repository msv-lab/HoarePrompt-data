Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `N`, which is an integer between 2 and 100000. The list `NUMBERS` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and N, and all elements in NUMBERS are distinct; n is assigned the value of N.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and N, and all elements in NUMBERS are distinct; n is assigned the value of N**
