According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list NUMBERS has at least 1 element. In this case, since all elements in NUMBERS are distinct and between 1 and N, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, n is assigned the value of N, sum is 0 does not determine the execution of the loop, so it needs to be adjusted to NUMBERS is a list with at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list, n is the value of the first element in the list, and sum is the sum of elements before the first element.
State: **NUMBERS is a list with at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list, n is the value of the first element in the list, sum is the sum of elements before the first element**
