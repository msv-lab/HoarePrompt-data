Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is incremented by the value of `num`. Since `num` is the third element in the list `NUMBERS`, `n` is the value of the third element in the list, and `sum` is the sum of elements before the third element plus `num`, the new value of `sum` will be the sum of all elements in the list `NUMBERS`. Therefore, the Output State is: NUMBERS is a list with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list, `n` is the value of the third element in the list, `sum` is the sum of all elements in the list.
Output State: **NUMBERS is a list with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list, `n` is the value of the third element in the list, `sum` is the sum of all elements in the list**
