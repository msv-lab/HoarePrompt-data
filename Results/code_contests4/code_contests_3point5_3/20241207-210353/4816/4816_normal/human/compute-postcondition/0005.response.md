According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `NUMBERS` is a list with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list, `n` is the value of the first element in the list, `sum` is the sum of elements before the first element. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `NUMBERS` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` should be the second element in the list, `n` should be the value of the second element in the list, and `sum` should be the sum of elements before the second element.
State: **NUMBERS is a list with at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list, n is the value of the second element in the list, sum is the sum of elements before the second element**
