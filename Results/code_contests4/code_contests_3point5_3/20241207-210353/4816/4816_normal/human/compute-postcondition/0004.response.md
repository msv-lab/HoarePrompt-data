Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is increased by the value of `num`, where `num` is the first element in the list `NUMBERS`. The previous values of `num`, `n`, and `sum` are not known, but the sum is increased by `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: NUMBERS is a list with at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list, n is the value of the first element in the list, sum is the sum of elements before the first element.
Output State: **NUMBERS is a list with at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list, n is the value of the first element in the list, sum is the sum of elements before the first element**
