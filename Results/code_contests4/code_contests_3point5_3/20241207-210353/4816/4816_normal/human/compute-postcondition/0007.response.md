According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `NUMBERS`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `NUMBERS` is a list with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list, `n` is the value of the second element in the list, `sum` is the sum of elements before the second element plus `num`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list, `n` is the value of the third element in the list, `sum` is the sum of elements before the third element plus `num`.
State: **NUMBERS is a list with at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list, n is the value of the third element in the list, sum is the sum of elements before the third element plus num**
