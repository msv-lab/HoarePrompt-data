Correctness: **True**

The annotated program takes in the number of episodes in a season and a list of episodes that Polycarpus has watched. It then calculates the sum of the watched episodes and subtracts it from the sum of the total episodes using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 where n is the total number of episodes. This will give the episode number that Polycarpus hasn't watched, and the program outputs this number.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly identifies the episode that Polycarpus hasn't watched based on the input provided. It calculates the missing episode by finding the difference between the sum of all episodes and the sum of the watched episodes, which is the correct approach to solve the problem. Hence, the program is correct.
