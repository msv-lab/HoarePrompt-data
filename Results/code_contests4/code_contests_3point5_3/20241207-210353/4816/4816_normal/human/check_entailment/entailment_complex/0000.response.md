Correctness: **True**

The program takes two inputs, `N` and `NUMBERS`, where `N` is the total number of episodes and `NUMBERS` is a list of episodes that Polycarpus has watched. It then calculates the sum of the watched episodes and subtracts it from the sum of all episodes from 1 to `N`. The result is the missing episode number, which is then printed.

The program follows the problem description accurately and will always output the correct missing episode number based on the provided input.
