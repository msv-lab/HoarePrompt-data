Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Polycarpus has watched all episodes except for one, and the function should identify which episode he has not watched. However, the code calculates the sum of all watched episodes and subtracts it from the sum of integers from 1 to `N`. This approach will only work if Polycarpus has watched all episodes in a consecutive manner from 1 to `N-1`, which is not guaranteed. The code does not handle cases where the watched episodes are not consecutive or do not start from 1. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
