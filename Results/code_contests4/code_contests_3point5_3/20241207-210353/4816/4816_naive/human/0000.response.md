Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly identify the episode that Polycarpus has not watched. The program calculates the sum of the episodes that Polycarpus has watched and then subtracts it from the sum of all episodes to find the missing episode number. This logic is flawed because it assumes that the episodes are in sequential order from 1 to n, which may not always be the case.

For example, if the input is:
```
10
3 8 10 1 7 9 6 5 2
```
The expected output should be 4, as episode 4 is the one that Polycarpus has not watched. However, the program will output 10 because it is summing all the watched episodes and subtracting it from the sum of all episodes, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
