You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Attention: we lost all the test cases for this problem, so instead of solving the problem, we need you to generate test cases. We're going to give you the answer, and you need to print a test case that produces the given answer. The original problem is in the following paragraph.

People don't use cash as often as they used to. Having a credit card solves some of the hassles of cash, such as having to receive change when you can't form the exact amount of money needed to purchase an item. Typically cashiers will give you as few coins as possible in change, but they don't have to. For example, if your change is 30 cents, a cashier could give you a 5 cent piece and a 25 cent piece, or they could give you three 10 cent pieces, or ten 1 cent pieces, two 5 cent pieces, and one 10 cent piece. Altogether there are 18 different ways to make 30 cents using only 1 cent pieces, 5 cent pieces, 10 cent pieces, and 25 cent pieces. Two ways are considered different if they contain a different number of at least one type of coin. Given the denominations of the coins and an amount of change to be made, how many different ways are there to make change?

As we mentioned before, we lost all the test cases for this problem, so we're actually going to give you the number of ways, and want you to produce a test case for which the number of ways is the given number. There could be many ways to achieve this (we guarantee there's always at least one), so you can print any, as long as it meets the constraints described below.

Input

Input will consist of a single integer A (1 ≤ A ≤ 105), the desired number of ways.

Output

In the first line print integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 106, 1 ≤ M ≤ 10), the amount of change to be made, and the number of denominations, respectively.

Then print M integers D1, D2, ..., DM (1 ≤ Di ≤ 106), the denominations of the coins. All denominations must be distinct: for any i ≠ j we must have Di ≠ Dj.

If there are multiple tests, print any of them. You can print denominations in atbitrary order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer input from the standard input, calculates a list of integers based on the input value, and prints the list along with other information. The function handles different cases based on the input value, such as when the input is less than or equal to 10, between 10 and 100, between 100 and 1000, between 1000 and 10000, and greater than 10000. In each case, it adjusts the list of integers accordingly. However, despite the annotations mentioning different scenarios, the actual code only prints out the list without returning any value. Also, there are missing edge cases such as when the input value is greater than 100000.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
