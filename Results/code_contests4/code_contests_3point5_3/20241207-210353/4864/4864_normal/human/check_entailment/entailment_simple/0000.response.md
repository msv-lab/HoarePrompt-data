Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not generate test cases as required by the problem description. Instead of generating a test case based on the given number of ways to make change, the program seems to be creating a list of denominations of coins based on the input number. This does not match the problem description, which asks for a test case to be generated based on the number of ways to make change.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
