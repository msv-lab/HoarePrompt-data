According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `x` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer read from standard input, change is 1000000, and nom is a list containing the integers 1 and 1000000. The loop is decrementing `x` by 1 in each iteration. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` needs to be checked. Since the loop is decrementing from 1000000 - 1 to 0, for the next iteration, `x` should be 0.
State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer read from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integers 1 and 1000000, x is 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
