Example Answer:
The code prints the elements in the list `nom` after converting them to strings and joining them with spaces. The list `nom` contains integers based on the conditions of the if-else block, and the value of `nom` is not given. The value of `nom` will be printed as a string with elements separated by spaces. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer; change is either 1000000 or 10000; nom is a list containing integers based on the conditions of the if-else block; res is 9999 if n is between 1000 and 10000, otherwise res is 1.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer; change is either 1000000 or 10000; nom is a list containing integers based on the conditions of the if-else block; res is 9999 if n is between 1000 and 10000, otherwise res is 1.**
