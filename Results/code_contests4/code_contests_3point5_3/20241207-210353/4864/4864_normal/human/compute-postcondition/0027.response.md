Example Answer:
After executing the code, `x` with the value 999999 is appended to the list `nom`. Since the length of `nom` is now 2, which is not equal to 10, the program does not break out of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom contains the integers 1 and 999999.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom contains the integers 1 and 999999**
