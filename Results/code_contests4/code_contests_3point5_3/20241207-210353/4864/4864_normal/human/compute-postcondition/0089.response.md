Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `nom`. The length of `nom` will be either increased by 1 or remain the same, depending on the previous length of `nom`. All other variables remain the same as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer between 1 and 105, n is greater than 10, n is larger than 10, n is either less than or equal to 10 or greater than 100, n is either less than or equal to 100 or greater than 1000, n is such that 1000 < n <= 10000, n is equal to 10000, the code prints '10000 2', change is 10000, nom is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, res is 9999, res_ is 1, for the loop to execute x is 0, the length of nom is either 10 or not equal to 10, and x is appended to nom. If the length of nom is equal to n % 10 + 2, then the program retains its initial state.
