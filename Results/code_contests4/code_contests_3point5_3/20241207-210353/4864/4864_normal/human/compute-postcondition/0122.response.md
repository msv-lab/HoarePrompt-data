Example Answer:
`nom` appends the value of `x`. The conditions for exiting the most internal loop or if statement are based on the length of `nom`. If the length of `nom` is 10, the loop exits, otherwise, if the length of `nom` is equal to the remainder of n divided by 10 plus 2, the loop exits. The value of `x` should be adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. The value of `change` is 100000. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer read from standard input such that n > 0, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer read from standard input such that n > 0, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be adjusted accordingly**
