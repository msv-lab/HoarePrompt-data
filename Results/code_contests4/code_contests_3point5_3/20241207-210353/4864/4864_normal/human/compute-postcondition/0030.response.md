Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom contains the integers 1 and 999999, for the loop to execute one more time x should be within the range of 999998 to 1. If the length of nom is 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
