Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer between 1 and 105, `n` is an input integer, `change` is either 1000000 or 10000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`, `res_` is either 1 or a value based on the conditions of the if else block. If 100 < n <= 1000, then `n` is an input integer, `change` is 1000000, and `nom` contains integers from 999999 to 999990 in descending order. If 1000 < n <= 10000, then `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` contains integers starting from 1 and adding consecutive integers until n % 10 + 2, `res` is 9999, and `res_` is 1.***
