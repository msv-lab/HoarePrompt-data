According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified in the for loop statement. The loop will execute as long as x is within the range specified. Before the loop starts, the value of x needs to be adjusted to be within the range specified in the for loop statement. In this case, x should be set to 999999 in order for the loop to execute as intended.

State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value `res_`; for the loop to execute the first time x is 999999**
