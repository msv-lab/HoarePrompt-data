Example Answer:
`res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`, where `//` is the floor division operator. As `change` is 1000000 and `res` is a calculated value, the value of `res_` will depend on the value of `res`. Since `res` is not explicitly given in the initial state, the exact value of `res_` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1. n is larger than 10. n is an integer, and the value of n is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 100; res is the calculated value based on the formula.
