Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer, change is either 1000000 or 10000, nom is a list containing the integer 1 and other integers based on the conditions of the if else block. If 10 < n <= 100, nom contains integers ranging from 999999 to 999991. If 100 < n <= 1000, nom contains integers from 999999 to 999990 in descending order. If 1000 < n <= 10000, nom starts from 1 and increases by consecutive integers until n % 10 + 2. res is 9999 if n is between 1000 and 10000, otherwise res is 1.***
