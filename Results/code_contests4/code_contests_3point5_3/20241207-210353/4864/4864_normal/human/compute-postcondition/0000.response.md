Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but it is guaranteed to be an integer within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input**
