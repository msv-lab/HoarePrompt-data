Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value `res_`; for the loop to execute the first time x is 999999. If the length of nom is equal to 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
