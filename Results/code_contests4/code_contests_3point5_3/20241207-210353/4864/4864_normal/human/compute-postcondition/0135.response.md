Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `change` concatenated with the length of the list `nom`. The value of `change` is either 1000000 or 10000. The contents of the list `nom` depend on the value of `n` as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer; change is either 1000000 or 10000; nom is a list containing integers based on the conditions of the if-else block; res is 9999 if n is between 1000 and 10000, otherwise res is 1.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer; change is either 1000000 or 10000; nom is a list containing integers based on the conditions of the if-else block; res is 9999 if n is between 1000 and 10000, otherwise res is 1**
