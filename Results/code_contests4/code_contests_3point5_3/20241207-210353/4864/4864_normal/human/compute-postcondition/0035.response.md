Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `nom`. Since `nom` initially contained the integers 1 and 999999, after executing `nom.append(x)`, `nom` will now contain the integers 1, 999999, and the value of `x`. The loop will execute one more time as `x` falls within the range of 999998 to 1. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an integer, change is 1000000, nom contains the integers 1, 999999, and the value of x, the loop executes one more time, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
