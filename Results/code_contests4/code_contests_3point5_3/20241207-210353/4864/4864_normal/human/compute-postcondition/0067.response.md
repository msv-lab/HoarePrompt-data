Example Answer:
The value of `change` is updated to 10000. The previous value of `change` is 1000000. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing the integer 1. n is larger than 10. The value of n is either less than or equal to 10 or greater than 100. n is either less than or equal to 100 or greater than 1000. n is such that 1000 < n <= 10000. n is equal to 10000.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing the integer 1. n is larger than 10. The value of n is either less than or equal to 10 or greater than 100. n is either less than or equal to 100 or greater than 1000. n is such that 1000 < n <= 10000. n is equal to 10000.**
