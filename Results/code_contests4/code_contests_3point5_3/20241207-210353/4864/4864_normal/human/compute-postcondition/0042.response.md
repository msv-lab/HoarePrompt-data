According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range provided to the for loop is valid. In this case, the loop will execute as long as x is in the range from 999999 to 1 in steps of -1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer read from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value of res_, x is 999999 for the loop to execute the first time**
