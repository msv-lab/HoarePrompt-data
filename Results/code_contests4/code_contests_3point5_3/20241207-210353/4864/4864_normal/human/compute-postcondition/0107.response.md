Example Answer:
`res_` is calculated based on the value of `change`, `res`, and `n`, and then appended to the list `nom`. The initial state of `nom` contains the integer 1, and after appending `res_`, it will have an additional value. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input; `change` is 100000; `nom` contains the integer 1 and an additional value based on the calculation of `res_`.
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input; `change` is 100000; `nom` contains the integer 1 and an additional value based on the calculation of `res_`**
