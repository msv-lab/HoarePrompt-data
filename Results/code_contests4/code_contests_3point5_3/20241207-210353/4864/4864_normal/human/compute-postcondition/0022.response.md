Example Answer:
`res_` is calculated based on a formula that is not provided, but it is then appended to the `nom` list. Since `nom` initially contained the integer 1, after this operation, it will contain the integer 1 followed by the calculated value `res_`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value `res_`.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value `res_`**
