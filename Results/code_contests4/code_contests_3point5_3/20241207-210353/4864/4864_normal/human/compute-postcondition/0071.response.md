Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing the integer 1. n is larger than 10. The value of n is either less than or equal to 10 or greater than 100. n is either less than or equal to 100 or greater than 1000. n is such that 1000 < n <= 10000. n is equal to 10000 and the code prints '10000 2'.***
