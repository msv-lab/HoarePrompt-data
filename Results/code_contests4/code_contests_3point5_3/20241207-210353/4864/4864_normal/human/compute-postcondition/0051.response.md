According to the code, the loop will iterate from 999999 down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, x is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, x should be 2.
State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer read from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integer 1, the calculated value of res_, and 999999, x is 2**
