Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer read from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integer 1, the calculated value of res_, and 999999, x is 2. If the length of nom is equal to n % 10 + 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
