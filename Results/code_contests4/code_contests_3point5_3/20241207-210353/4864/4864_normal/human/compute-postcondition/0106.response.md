Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`, where `n` is an input integer. The value of `res` depends on the value of `n`, which is read from standard input. After that, `res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`, where `change` is 100000. The value of `res_` is calculated based on the previous values of `change` and `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input; `change` is 100000; `nom` is a list containing the integer 1; n is larger than 10; `res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is calculated based on the value of `change`, `res`, and `n`.
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input; `change` is 100000; `nom` is a list containing the integer 1; n is larger than 10; `res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is calculated based on the value of `change`, `res`, and `n**
