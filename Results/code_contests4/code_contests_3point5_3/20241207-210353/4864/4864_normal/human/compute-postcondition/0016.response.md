Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `nom`. Since the length of `nom` will be increased by 1 after appending `x`, the new length of `nom` will be `n+1`. If the new length of `nom` is equal to `n`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, and `x` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
