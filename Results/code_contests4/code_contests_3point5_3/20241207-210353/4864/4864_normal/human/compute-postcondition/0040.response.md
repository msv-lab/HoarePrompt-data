Example Answer:
`res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`, where `change` is 1000000 and `res` is calculated based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is greater than 100, `res` is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the value of `res_` is determined by the calculation `1000000 // res`. Other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1. n is larger than 10. The value of n is either less than or equal to 10 or greater than 100. n is an integer such that 100 < n <= 1000; res is calculated based on the value of n; res_ is calculated based on the value of n and change.**
