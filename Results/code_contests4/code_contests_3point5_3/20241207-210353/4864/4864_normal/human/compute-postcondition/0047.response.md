Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer read from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value of res_, x is 999999 for the loop to execute the first time. The length of nom is not equal to 10. The length of nom is equal to n % 10 + 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
