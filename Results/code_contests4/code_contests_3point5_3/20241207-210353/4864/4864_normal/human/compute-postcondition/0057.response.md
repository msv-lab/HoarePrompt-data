According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer read from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, the calculated value of `res_`, and 999999, `x` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer read from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, the calculated value of `res_`, and 999999, `x` is 1**
