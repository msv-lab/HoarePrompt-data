Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input such that n > 0; `change` is 100000; `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, the length of `nom` is equal to the remainder of n divided by 10 plus 2. After the execution of the if else block, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
