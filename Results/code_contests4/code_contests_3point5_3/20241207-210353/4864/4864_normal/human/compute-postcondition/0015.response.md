Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, and x is 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If the length of nom is equal to n, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
