Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`, for the loop to execute one more time `x` should be decreased by 1. If the length of `nom` is equal to n % 10 + 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
