Example Answer:
`nom` appends `x` to its list, which is initially `[1, res_]`. Since the length of `nom` is increased by 1 after the append operation, the new length of `nom` will determine whether to break out of the loop or if statement. If the length becomes 10, we break out, otherwise if the length is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, we also break out. The value of `x` is 999999. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer read from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integer 1, the calculated value of res_, and 999999, x is 999999 for the loop to execute the first time.
