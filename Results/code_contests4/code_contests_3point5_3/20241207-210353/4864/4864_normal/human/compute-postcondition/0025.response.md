Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value `res_`; for the loop to execute the first time x is 999999. The length of nom is equal to 10 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
