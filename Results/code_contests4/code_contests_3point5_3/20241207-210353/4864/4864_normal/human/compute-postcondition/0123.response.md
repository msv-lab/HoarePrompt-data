According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `x` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`, and `x` is at a specific value based on the previous iteration. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to decrement `x` by 1 to move to the next value in the range specified by the for loop.
State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`, for the loop to execute one more time `x` should be decreased by 1**
