Example Answer: 
`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`, where `n` is the input integer read from standard input. Since `n` is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 100, `res` will be calculated as `n - (n % 10) - 1`. For example, if `n` is 35, then `res` will be 30. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1. n is larger than 10. n is an integer, and the value of n is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 100; res is the calculated value based on the formula.
