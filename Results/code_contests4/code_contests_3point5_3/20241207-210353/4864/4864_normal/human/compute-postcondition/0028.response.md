According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `x` is within the range of `1000000 - 1` to 1. At the end of the last iteration, the loop started at `1000000 - 1`, so `x` was 999999. To execute the loop one more time, `x` should be within the range of `999998` to `1`.
State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom contains the integers 1 and 999999, for the loop to execute one more time x should be within the range of 999998 to 1**
