Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer between 1 and 105. If 1000 < n <= 10000, then `n` is equal to 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing integers starting from 1 and adding consecutive integers until n % 10 + 2 is reached, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1. If the condition is not met, then `A` is an integer between 1 and 105, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of res_.***
