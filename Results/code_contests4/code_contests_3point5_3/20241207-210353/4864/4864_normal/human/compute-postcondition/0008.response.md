Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `nom`, and `x` is 1000000. Therefore, after execution, `nom` will contain `[1, 1000000]`. The length of `nom` will be 2, which is not equal to `n`, so the loop will continue. 
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integers 1 and 1000000.**
