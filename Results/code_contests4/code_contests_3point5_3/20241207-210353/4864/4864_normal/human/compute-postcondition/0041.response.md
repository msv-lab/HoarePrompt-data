Example Answer:
After executing the code, the value of `res_` is calculated based on the value of `n` and `change`. Since the value of `n` is between 100 and 1000, `res_` is calculated accordingly. The value of `res` is not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, so we cannot determine its value. After appending `res_` to the list `nom`, the list `nom` will contain the integer 1 and the calculated value of `res_`.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value of res_.**
