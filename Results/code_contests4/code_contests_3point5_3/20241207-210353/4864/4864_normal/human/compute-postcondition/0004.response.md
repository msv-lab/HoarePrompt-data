According to the code, the loop will execute as long as x ranges from 1000000 to 1 in decreasing order. Since n is an input integer, it is not directly related to the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the initial state needs to be adjusted so that x starts at 1000000 and ends at 1 in the loop.

State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1, for the loop to execute the first time x is 1000000**
