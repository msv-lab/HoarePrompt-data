According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1000000 to 1 in decreasing order. At the end of the last iteration, A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, and x is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, x should be 1 and nom should have a length less than n.
State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, and x is 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
