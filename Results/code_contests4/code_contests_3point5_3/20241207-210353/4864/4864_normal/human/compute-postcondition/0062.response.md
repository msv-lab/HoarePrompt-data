Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer read from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, the calculated value of `res_`, 999999, and 1, `x` is 1. If the length of `nom` is 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
