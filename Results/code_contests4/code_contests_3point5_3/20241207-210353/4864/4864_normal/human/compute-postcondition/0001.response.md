Example Answer:
The variable `change` is assigned the value 1000000. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input; `change` is 1000000.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input; `change` is 1000000**
