According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is in the range from 1000000 - 1 to 0 (exclusive). Since the loop starts at 1000000 - 1 and iterates downwards to 1, it will always execute. 

To adjust the states before the loop starts, we need to update `n` to ensure that the loop executes. Additionally, we need to update `res_` to determine the additional value in `nom`.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; `n` is an input integer read from standard input such that n > 0; `change` is 100000; `nom` contains the integer 1 and an additional value based on the calculation of `res_`**
