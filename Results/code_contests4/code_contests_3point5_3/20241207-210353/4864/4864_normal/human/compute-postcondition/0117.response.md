According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer read from standard input such that n > 0, `change` is 100000, and `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from 1000000 - 1 to 0, the next value of `x` would be one less than the current value of `x`.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, `n` is an input integer read from standard input such that n > 0, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and additional values based on the calculation of `res_`, for the loop to execute one more time `x` should be adjusted accordingly**
