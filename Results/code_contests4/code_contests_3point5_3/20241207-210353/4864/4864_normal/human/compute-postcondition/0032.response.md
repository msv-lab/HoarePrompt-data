According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x` and the length of the `nom` list. If `x` is within the range of 999998 to 1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an integer, change is 1000000, nom contains the integers 1 and 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, x should be within the range of 999998 to 1.
State: **A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an integer, change is 1000000, nom contains the integers 1 and 999999, for the loop to execute one more time x should be within the range of 999998 to 1**
