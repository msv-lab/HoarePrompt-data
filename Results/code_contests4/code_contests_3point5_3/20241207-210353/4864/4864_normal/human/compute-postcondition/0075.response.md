According to the code, the loop will execute as long as x > 0. Since the range starts from 1000000 - 1 and goes down to 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, A is an integer between 1 and 105, n is greater than 10, n is larger than 10, n is either less than or equal to 10 or greater than 100, n is either less than or equal to 100 or greater than 1000, n is such that 1000 < n <= 10000, n is equal to 10000 and the code prints '10000 2', change is 10000, nom is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, res is 9999, res_ is 1.
State: **A is an integer between 1 and 105, n is greater than 10, n is larger than 10, n is either less than or equal to 10 or greater than 100, n is either less than or equal to 100 or greater than 1000, n is such that 1000 < n <= 10000, n is equal to 10000 and the code prints '10000 2', change is 10000, nom is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, res is 9999, res_ is 1, for the loop to execute x is 1000000 - 1**
