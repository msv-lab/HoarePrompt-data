Postcondition: ***A is an integer between 1 and 105, n is greater than 10, n is such that 1000 < n <= 10000, the length of nom is equal to n % 10 + 2, x is equal to n % 10 + 1. If the length of nom is equal to 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of nom is not equal to 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
