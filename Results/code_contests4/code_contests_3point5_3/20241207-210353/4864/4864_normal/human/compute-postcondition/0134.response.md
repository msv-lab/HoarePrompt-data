Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer; change is either 1000000 or 10000; nom is a list containing the integers based on the conditions of the if else block. If n <= 10, nom contains 1, 1000000, and all integers from 999999 down to 1000001-n. If n is greater than 999999, nom will contain all integers from 1 to 1000000. If 10 < n <= 100, nom contains integers ranging from 999999 to 999991. If 100 < n <= 1000, nom contains integers from 999999 to 999990 in descending order. If 1000 < n <= 10000, nom starts from 1 and increases by consecutive integers until n % 10 + 2. res is 9999 if n is between 1000 and 10000, otherwise res is 1.***
