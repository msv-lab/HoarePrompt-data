Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`, which is `10000 - 10000 % 10 - 1 = 10000 - 0 - 1 = 9999`. Therefore, `res` is 9999. Then `res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`, which is `10000 // 9999 = 1`. Thus, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing the integer 1. n is larger than 10. The value of n is either less than or equal to 10 or greater than 100. n is either less than or equal to 100 or greater than 1000. n is such that 1000 < n <= 10000. n is equal to 10000 and the code prints '10000 2'; res is 9999; res_ is 1.
