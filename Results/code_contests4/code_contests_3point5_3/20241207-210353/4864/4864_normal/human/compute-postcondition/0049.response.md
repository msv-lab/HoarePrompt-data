Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105, n is an input integer read from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing the integer 1 and the calculated value of res_, x is 999999 for the loop to execute the first time. If the length of nom is 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the length of nom is equal to n % 10 + 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
