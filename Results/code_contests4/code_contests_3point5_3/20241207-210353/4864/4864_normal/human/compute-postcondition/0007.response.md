Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 <= A <= 105; n is an input integer read from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing the integer 1, for the loop to execute the first time x is 1000000. If the length of nom is equal to n, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
