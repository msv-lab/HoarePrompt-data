Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `r` from input as described in the problem description.
- The formula used in the code to calculate the star area is mathematically correct and aligns with the problem description.
- The code calculates the star area using the given formula and prints the result.
- The output is a single number representing the star area, which is what is expected according to the problem description.
- The code does not have any obvious logical errors or missing cases based on the problem description.
- The code does not have any error handling for cases where the input values are not within the specified constraints, but this is not a requirement based on the problem description.
