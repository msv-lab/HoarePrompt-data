Correctness: **False**

The program does not calculate the area of a star as described in the problem. Instead, it calculates some value using a mathematical formula involving the input values `n` and `r`. The formula used in the program does not match the description of how a star figure with `n` corners should be constructed. Additionally, the program lacks error handling for cases where the input values are not within the specified constraints.
