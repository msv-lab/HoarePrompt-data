Correctness: **False**

The program provided is incorrect because it is missing the `import math` statement at the beginning of the program. Additionally, there is a syntax error in the calculation of `ans` as the `math` module is not used correctly. The `math` module functions should be called with `math.` prefix.

Furthermore, the program does not output the star area with the required precision as mentioned in the problem description. The program simply calculates the area and prints it without considering the relative error.

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
