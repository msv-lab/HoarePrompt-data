Example Answer:
n and r are assigned values from the input after splitting it. As n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5 and r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the values assigned to n and r will follow those conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
