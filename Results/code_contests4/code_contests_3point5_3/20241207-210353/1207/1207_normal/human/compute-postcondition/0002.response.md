Example Answer:
The `ans` variable is assigned the result of a complex mathematical expression involving `n`, `r`, and `pi`. Since `n` is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, `r` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `pi` is a known constant, we can calculate the result of the expression. After execution, the value of `ans` will be a floating-point number. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, pi is 3.141592653589793, ans is a floating-point number.
Output State: **n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, pi is 3.141592653589793, ans is a floating-point number**
