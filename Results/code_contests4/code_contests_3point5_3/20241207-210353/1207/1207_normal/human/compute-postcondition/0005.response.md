Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `r` from input and calculates the value of nCr using a mathematical formula. It then prints the result. The function assumes `n` is a prime number greater than or equal to 5 and `r` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. However, the code snippet is missing the import statement for the `math` module, which is necessary for the calculations to be performed. Additionally, the function lacks error handling for cases where the input values are not within the specified constraints.**
