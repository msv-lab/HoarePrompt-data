Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the area of a star figure as described in the problem statement. It uses the formula provided in the problem description to calculate the area and outputs the result with the specified relative error. The code handles the input of n and r, calculates the area using the formula, and prints the result. Additionally, the code uses the math module to access the sin function. The program will work correctly for all valid inputs where n is a prime number and follows the given constraints.
