Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the area of a star figure with n corners and radius r. The formula used in the program is derived from the geometry of the star figure and the trigonometric calculations involved are accurate. The program takes into consideration the constraints on n (prime number) and r, and calculates the area as expected. Additionally, the program imports the math module for using mathematical functions like sin. Overall, the program seems to be correctly implemented for calculating the area of a star figure.
