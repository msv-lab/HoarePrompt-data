Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where there are no tower heights provided or if the loop does not execute due to certain conditions, potentially leading to incorrect output in those scenarios. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the target height is smaller than the minimum tower height. These cases are not covered in the current implementation.
