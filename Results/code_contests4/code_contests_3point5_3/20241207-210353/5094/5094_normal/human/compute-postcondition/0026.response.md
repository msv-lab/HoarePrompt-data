Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `cnt` is incremented by `tot`, `tot`, `slices`, `i` remain the same.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `cnt` is incremented by `tot`, `tot`, `slices`, `i` remain the same**
