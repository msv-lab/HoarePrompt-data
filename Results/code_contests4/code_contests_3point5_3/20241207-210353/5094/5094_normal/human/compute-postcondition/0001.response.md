Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a Counter object `h` by mapping each integer value from the input split by space. The input values are not provided in the initial state, so the specific values of the Counter object `h` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5 and n ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `h` is a Counter object created from the input values.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5 and n ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `h` is a Counter object created from the input values**
