Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5 and n ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `h` is a Counter object created from the input values, `tot` is incremented by the value of `h[i]`, `cnt` is equal to `tot` if the sum of `cnt` and `tot` is greater than `k`, `slices` is incremented by 1. If the sum of `cnt` and `tot` is less than or equal to `k`, `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot`, and `slices` is 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1 from the previous value.**
