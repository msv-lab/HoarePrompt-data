Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5 and n ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `cnt`, `tot`, and `slices` are integers representing counts and slices. If `cnt` + `tot` > `k`, then `cnt` is equal to `tot` and `slices` is incremented by 1. If `cnt` + `tot` ≤ `k`, then `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot` and `slices` is set to 0. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1 from the previous value.***
