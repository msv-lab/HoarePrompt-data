Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `cnt`, `tot`, `slices`, `i` should be adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time if `i` is in `h`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `cnt + tot > k`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`, `tot`, `slices` are all increased by 1 and `i` remains the same unless it is in `h` where it is adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. If `cnt + tot` is not greater than `k`, `n`, `k`, `cnt` are incremented by `tot`, `tot`, `slices`, `i` remain the same.***
