Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `k` are unknown until the input is provided. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5 and n ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5 and n ≤ k ≤ 10^9**
