Example Answer:
`cnt` is assigned the value of `tot`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `cnt`, `tot`, `slices`, `i` should be adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time if `i` is in `h`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables, `cnt` is equal to `tot`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `cnt`, `tot`, `slices`, `i` should be adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time if `i` is in `h`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables, `cnt` is equal to `tot`**
