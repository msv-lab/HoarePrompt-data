Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5 and n ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `h` is a Counter object created from the input values, `tot` is incremented by the value of `h[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot`, `slices` is 0, for the loop to execute `200000` is greater than the minimum value in `h`, and `i` is in `h`. Additionally, `cnt + tot` is less than or equal to `k`**
