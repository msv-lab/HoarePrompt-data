Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of n, k, and the heights of the towers.
2. It correctly calculates the minimum number of good slices required to make all towers have the same height.
3. The program iterates through the heights of the towers and calculates the total number of cubes that need to be removed to make each tower have the same height.
4. It handles all towers and all potential heights to ensure that the minimum number of good slices is calculated accurately.
5. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples.
