Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of towers and restriction on slices.
2. It correctly calculates the minimum number of good slices needed to make all towers have the same height.
3. The program iterates through the towers and calculates the total number of cubes to be removed in each slice, ensuring that the total number of removed cubes does not exceed the restriction on slices.
4. The program outputs the minimum number of slices required.

Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and should work for all potential cases.
