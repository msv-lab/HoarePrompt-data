You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. In each leaf vertex there's a single integer — the number of apples in this vertex. 

The weight of a subtree is the sum of all numbers in this subtree leaves. For instance, the weight of a subtree that corresponds to some leaf is the number written in the leaf.

A tree is balanced if for every vertex v of the tree all its subtrees, corresponding to the children of vertex v, are of equal weight. 

Count the minimum number of apples that you need to remove from the tree (specifically, from some of its leaves) in order to make the tree balanced. Notice that you can always achieve the goal by just removing all apples.

Input

The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105), showing the number of vertices in the tree. The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 108), ai is the number of apples in the vertex number i. The number of apples in non-leaf vertices is guaranteed to be zero. 

Then follow n - 1 lines, describing the tree edges. Each line contains a pair of integers xi, yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi) — the vertices connected by an edge. 

The vertices are indexed from 1 to n. Vertex 1 is the root.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the sin, cout streams cin, cout or the %I64d specifier.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

    #The program returns the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The list a contains n integers where each integer ai (0 <= ai <= 10^8) represents the number of apples in the vertex i. The input tree has n - 1 edges connecting the vertices.**
def func_3():
    return map(int, func_2().split())
    #The program returns a map object with integers after splitting the output of func_2()

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The list of integers a contains n elements where each element ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8. The input tree edges are represented as pairs of integers xi, yi where 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree.
def func_4():

#Function 5:

#Function 7:

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
