Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. It follows the steps outlined in the problem description to calculate the minimum number of apples that need to be removed in order to make the tree balanced. The functions in the program handle the input processing, tree traversal, and calculation of the minimum number of apples to remove as required by the problem.

The program ensures that the tree is traversed correctly, calculates the least common multiple of the children nodes, and determines the maximum number of apples to remove based on the calculated least common multiple. Ultimately, the program correctly updates the number of apples in each vertex to achieve balance in the tree.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
