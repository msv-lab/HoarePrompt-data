Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not handle the case where the tree is already balanced. The function `func_9` calculates the minimum number of apples that need to be removed to balance the tree, but it does not account for the scenario where the tree is already balanced. In this case, the function should return 0 as no apples need to be removed. Since the code does not include this scenario, it does not fully adhere to the problem description.

Additionally, there is a potential issue with the `func_8` function. The function removes the parent vertex from the list of children vertices, but it does not update the children vertices to reflect the removal of the parent. This could lead to incorrect calculations in the `func_9` function, as the removed parent might still be considered in the calculations.

Therefore, based on the missing handling of the already balanced tree case and the potential issue in the `func_8` function, the correctness of the code is **False**.
