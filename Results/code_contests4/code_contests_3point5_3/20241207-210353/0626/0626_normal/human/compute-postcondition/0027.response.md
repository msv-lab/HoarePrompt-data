Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the program will have `max` updated to the value of `t` satisfying the specified conditions. If `max` was initially less than 0 or greater than `t`, the function will execute the necessary conditions to update `max`. Additionally, there will be at least one more child node to iterate over for node 2, and `t` will be calculated based on the given formula using the values of `child[1]` and `lcm`.***
