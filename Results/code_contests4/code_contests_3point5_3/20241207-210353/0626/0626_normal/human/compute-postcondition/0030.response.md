Example Answer:
The value of `node[1]` is assigned the result of `max` multiplied by the length of `node[2]`. However, the initial state of `max` and `node[2]` are unknown, so the final state cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **The final state cannot be accurately determined due to unknown initial values of `max` and `node[2]`.**
