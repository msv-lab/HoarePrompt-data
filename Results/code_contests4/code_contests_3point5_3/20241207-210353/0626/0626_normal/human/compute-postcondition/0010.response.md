Example Answer:
The value of `lcm` is updated by calling `func_7` with parameters `lcm` and `child[0]`. The specific values of `lcm` and `child[0]` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi ≠ yi, vertex 1 is the root, node[1] is less than 0, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_7` with parameters `lcm` and `child[0]`, `max` is -1, for the loop to execute there are at least two child nodes for node 2, `func_9(child)` is executed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi ≠ yi, vertex 1 is the root, node[1] is less than 0, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_7` with parameters `lcm` and `child[0]`, `max` is -1, for the loop to execute there are at least two child nodes for node 2, `func_9(child)` is executed.**
