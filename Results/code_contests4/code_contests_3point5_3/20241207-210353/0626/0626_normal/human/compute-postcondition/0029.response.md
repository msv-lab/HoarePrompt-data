Example Answer:
`node[0]` is assigned the value `lcm`, but the previous values of other variables are unknown. The loop updates `max` based on the comparison with `t` for each child node of node 2. The loop iterates over all the child nodes, and `t` is calculated for each iteration using the formula provided. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop finishes executing, `max` will hold the maximum value calculated for `t` satisfying the specified conditions.
Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `max` will hold the maximum value calculated for `t` satisfying the specified conditions.**
