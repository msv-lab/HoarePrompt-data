Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi â‰  yi, vertex 1 is the root, node[1] is less than 0, lcm is the least common multiple of all the children nodes of node 2, max is -1, for the loop to execute the first time node 2 has at least 1 child, and t is calculated as described, additionally max is less than 0 or max is greater than t***
