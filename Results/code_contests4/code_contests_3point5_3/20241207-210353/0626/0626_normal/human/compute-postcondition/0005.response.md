According to the code, the loop can only execute if there are children nodes for node 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, there must be at least one child node for node 2. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that node 2 has at least one child node.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi â‰  yi. Vertex 1 is the root. node[1] is less than 0, `lcm` is 1, `max` is -1, for the loop to execute there is at least one child node for node 2**
