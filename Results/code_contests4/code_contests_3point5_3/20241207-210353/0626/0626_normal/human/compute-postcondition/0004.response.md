Example Answer:
The variable `max` is assigned the value -1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi ≠ yi. Vertex 1 is the root. node[1] is less than 0. `lcm` is 1, `max` is -1.
