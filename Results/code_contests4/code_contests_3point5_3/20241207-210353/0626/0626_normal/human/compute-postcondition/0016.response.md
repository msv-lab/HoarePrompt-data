Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value of `child[1]` divided by `lcm` and then multiplied by `lcm`. The values of `child[1]`, `lcm`, and other variables are not given. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi ≠ yi, vertex 1 is the root, node[1] is less than 0, `lcm` is the least common multiple of all the children nodes of node 2, `max` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time node 2 has at least 1 child, and `t` is calculated as described.
