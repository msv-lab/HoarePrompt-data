Example Answer:
The variable `max` is assigned the value of `t`. The value of `max` is updated to the new value of `t` satisfying the specified conditions. Other variables and values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi ≠ yi, vertex 1 is the root, node[1] is less than 0, lcm is the least common multiple of all the children nodes of node 2, `max` is updated with the value of `t` satisfying the specified conditions, there is at least one more child node to iterate over for node 2.
