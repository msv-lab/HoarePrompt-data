Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi â‰  yi, vertex 1 is the root, node[1] is less than 0, lcm is the least common multiple of all the children nodes of node 2, `max` is updated with the value of `t` satisfying the specified conditions, there is at least one more child node to iterate over for node 2. If `max` is less than 0 or `max` is greater than `t`, then the function executes the conditions mentioned above, for the loop to execute another time, there is at least one more child node to iterate over for node 2. `t` is calculated based on the given formula using the values of `child[1]` and `lcm`**
