Functionality: **The function func_9 accepts a parameter node representing a node in a tree structure. It calculates the least common multiple of all the children nodes of node 2 and the maximum value obtained by dividing the second element of each child node by the least common multiple. The function then updates the first and second elements of the input node accordingly. However, the annotations suggest that the function does not return anything, which is not accurate as the code performs calculations and updates the input node. It is important to note that the function does not explicitly return a value but modifies the input node in place.**
