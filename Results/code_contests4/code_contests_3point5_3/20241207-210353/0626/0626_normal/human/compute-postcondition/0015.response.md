According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the children nodes of node 2. If node 2 has at least 1 child, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the least common multiple `lcm` is already defined as the least common multiple of all the children nodes of node 2, so it does not need to be adjusted. The `max` value is set to -1 and does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the children nodes of node 2 must exist.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi â‰  yi, vertex 1 is the root, node[1] is less than 0, `lcm` is the least common multiple of all the children nodes of node 2, `max` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time node 2 has at least 1 child**
