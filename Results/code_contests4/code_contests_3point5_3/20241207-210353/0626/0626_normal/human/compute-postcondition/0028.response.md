Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `max` will hold the maximum value calculated for `t` satisfying the specified conditions. The loop will update `max` based on the comparison with `t` for each child node of node 2. The loop will iterate over all the child nodes, and `t` will be calculated for each iteration using the formula provided.**
