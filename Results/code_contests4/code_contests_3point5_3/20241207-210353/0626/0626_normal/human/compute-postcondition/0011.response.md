According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of child nodes for node 2 and the function `func_9(child)`. If there are at least two child nodes for node 2, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_7` with parameters `lcm` and `child[0]`, `max` is -1, and `func_9(child)` is executed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least two child nodes for node 2 and `func_9(child)` must be executed again.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, the list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8, the tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi â‰  yi, vertex 1 is the root, node[1] is less than 0, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_7` with parameters `lcm` and `child[0]`, `max` is -1, for the loop to execute there are at least two child nodes for node 2, `func_9(child)` is executed again**
