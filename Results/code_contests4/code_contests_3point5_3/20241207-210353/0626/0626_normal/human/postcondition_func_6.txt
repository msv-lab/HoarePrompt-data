The function func_7 accepts a list 'a' of n integers and an integer 'b'. It then divides the elements in 'a' by the result of calling func_6 with 'a' and 'b', and multiplies the result by 'b' to return the final value. The function assumes 'a' is a valid list and does not handle potential division by zero errors or other edge cases.
