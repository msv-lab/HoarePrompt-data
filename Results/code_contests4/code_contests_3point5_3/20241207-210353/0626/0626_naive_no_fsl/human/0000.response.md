Correctness: False

The provided code does not seem to correctly solve the given problem. The logic in the code does not seem to properly calculate the minimum number of apples that need to be removed to make the tree balanced. The functions defined in the code do not directly address the problem requirements of determining the balance of the tree based on the weights of its subtrees.

There is a lack of clear implementation of the logic required to calculate the minimum number of apples to remove in order to balance the tree. The code seems to be focused on tree traversal and node processing, but it does not directly address the problem statement.

Therefore, without a clear implementation of the logic to solve the problem, the correctness of the code is in question.
