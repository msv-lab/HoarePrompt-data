Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program implements a depth-first search to traverse the tree and calculate the minimum number of apples that need to be removed in order to make the tree balanced. It correctly handles the input of the tree structure and the number of apples in each vertex. The logic to calculate the minimum number of apples to remove is also correct. 

Since the program follows the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is considered to be true.
