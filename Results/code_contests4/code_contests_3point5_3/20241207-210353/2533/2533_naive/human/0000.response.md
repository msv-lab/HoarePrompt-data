Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimum possible time "t" such that if Igor closes the mousetrap at "t" seconds from the beginning, then all the mice are strictly inside the mousetrap. The program handles all the cases where the mice may or may not enter the mousetrap boundaries based on their initial positions and speeds. It correctly calculates the time needed for all mice to be inside the mousetrap and outputs the correct result. The program also checks for scenarios where it is not possible for all mice to be inside the mousetrap and outputs -1 in such cases. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
