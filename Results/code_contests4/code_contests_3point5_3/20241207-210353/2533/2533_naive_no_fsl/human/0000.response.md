Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the earliest time moment in which Igor is able to catch all the mice by determining the intersection points of the mice paths with the mousetrap rectangle. It handles the cases where the mice paths are parallel to the x-axis or y-axis and where the mice paths cross the mousetrap boundaries. The program outputs the minimum possible non-negative number 't' such that all the mice are strictly inside the mousetrap, or -1 if there is no such 't'. The logic and calculations in the program seem to be correct and align with the problem description. No case has been identified where the program does not work as expected.
