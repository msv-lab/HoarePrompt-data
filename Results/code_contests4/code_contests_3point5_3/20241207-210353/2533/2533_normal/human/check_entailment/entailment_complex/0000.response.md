Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program `func_1` does not perform the task of determining the earliest time moment in which Igor is able to catch all the mice inside the mousetrap. Instead, it simply reads input from `sys.stdin` line by line and yields each value from the input. The program does not process the input data to solve the actual problem described in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
