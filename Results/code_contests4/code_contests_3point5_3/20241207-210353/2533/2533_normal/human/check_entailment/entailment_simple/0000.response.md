Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not actually solve the problem described. It only reads input from `sys.stdin`, but it does not perform any calculations or logic to determine the earliest time moment in which Igor is able to catch all the mice inside the mousetrap.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not solve the problem as required.
