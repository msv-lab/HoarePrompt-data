Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately reads the input and calculates the earliest time moment in which Igor is able to catch all the mice by closing the mousetrap.
- It correctly considers the position and speed of each mouse to determine the time required for the mice to be strictly inside the mousetrap.
- The code handles cases where the mice are moving in different directions and ensures that all mice are considered before determining the minimum possible time.
- The output format also matches the expected output format as mentioned in the problem description.
- The implementation seems to cover all potential cases as per the problem description and the provided examples.
