Example Answer:
The code snippet `yield value` yields a value, but it doesn't directly affect the initial state variables. The loop will execute another iteration if more input is available from sys.stdin and another value is yielded. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time there is more input available from sys.stdin and another value is yielded.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time there is more input available from sys.stdin and another value is yielded**
