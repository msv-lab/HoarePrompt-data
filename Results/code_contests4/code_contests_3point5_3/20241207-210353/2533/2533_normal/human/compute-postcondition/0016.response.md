According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. If there is more input available, the loop will execute another time. At the end of the previous iteration, n is a positive integer and all values from the input 'line' have been yielded. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more input available from `sys.stdin`.
State: **n is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time there is more input available from sys.stdin**
