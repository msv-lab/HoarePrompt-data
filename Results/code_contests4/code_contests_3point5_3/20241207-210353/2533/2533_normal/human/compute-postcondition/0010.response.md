Example Answer:
The yield statement returns a value from a generator function. In this case, the value being yielded is 'value'. Since 'value' is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. However, when the yield statement is executed, the program will pause and return that value. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time there is more input available from sys.stdin and the value 'value' is yielded.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time there is more input available from sys.stdin and the value 'value' is yielded**
