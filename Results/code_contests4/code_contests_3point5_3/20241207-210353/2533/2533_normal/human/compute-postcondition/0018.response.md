Example Answer:
The code snippet `yield value` yields the value obtained from the next input available from `sys.stdin`. Since the loop will execute one more time after yielding the value, the program will wait for the next input to continue. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input**
