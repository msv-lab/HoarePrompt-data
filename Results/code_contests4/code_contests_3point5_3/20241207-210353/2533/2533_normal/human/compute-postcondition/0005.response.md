According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input `line` from sys.stdin. If there is more input available, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, and there must be input available from sys.stdin. For the loop to execute one more time, there must still be input available from sys.stdin.
State: **n is a positive integer, there must be input available from sys.stdin and a value is yielded for the loop to execute another time**
