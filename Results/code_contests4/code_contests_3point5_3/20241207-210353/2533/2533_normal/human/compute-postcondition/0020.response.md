Example Answer:
The code `yield value` is used to produce a value to be returned by a generator function. In this case, the program is paused and waiting for the next input that contains more values to be split for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input that contains more values to be split for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input that contains more values to be split for the loop to execute again**
