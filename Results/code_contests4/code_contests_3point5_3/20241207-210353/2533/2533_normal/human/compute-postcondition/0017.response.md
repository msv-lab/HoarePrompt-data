According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the availability of more input from sys.stdin. If there is more input available, the loop can execute another time. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `more input available from sys.stdin` and value is the next value after splitting the line.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time more input is available from sys.stdin, value is the next value after splitting the line**
