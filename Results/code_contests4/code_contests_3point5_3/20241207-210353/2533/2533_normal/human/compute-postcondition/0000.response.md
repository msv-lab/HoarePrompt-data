According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from `sys.stdin`. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted so that there is input available from `sys.stdin`. Additionally, since the loop will execute for each line of input, the loop will iterate over each line provided by `sys.stdin`. 
State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000, for the loop to execute there must be input available from sys.stdin**
