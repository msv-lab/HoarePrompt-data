According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input available from sys.stdin. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer and there must be input available from sys.stdin. To execute the loop one more time, there must still be input available from sys.stdin.
State: **n is a positive integer, there must be input available from sys.stdin for the loop to execute another time**
