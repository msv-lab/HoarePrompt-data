According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from sys.stdin and the values yielded by the split() function. If there is more input available from sys.stdin and another value is yielded, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer. So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more input available from sys.stdin and another value must be yielded by the split() function.
State: **n is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time there is more input available from sys.stdin and another value is yielded**
