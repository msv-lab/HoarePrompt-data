Example Answer:
The code snippet `yield value` is used to produce a value to be returned by a generator function. In this case, the program is waiting for the next input that contains more values to be split for the loop to execute one more time, and then it yields the value generated by the generator function. The state of the program remains the same as before executing the code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input that contains more values to be split for the loop to execute one more time**
