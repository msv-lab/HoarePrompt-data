According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is input available from sys.stdin and there is a value yielded from the split line. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, there must be input available from sys.stdin and a value yielded from the split line.
State: **n is a positive integer, there must be input available from sys.stdin and a value is yielded**
