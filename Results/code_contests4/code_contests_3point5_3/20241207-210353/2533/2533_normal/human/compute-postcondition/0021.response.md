According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `line`. If `line` contains more values to split, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input that contains more values to be split. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next input should contain more values to be split.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input that contains more values to be split for the loop to execute one more time**
