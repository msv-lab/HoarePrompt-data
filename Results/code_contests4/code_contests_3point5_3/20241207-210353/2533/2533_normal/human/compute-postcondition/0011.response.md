According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from sys.stdin and the availability of more values to yield. If there are more values available to yield, the loop will execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer and the loop has executed at least once. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more input available from sys.stdin and another value must be yielded.
State: **n is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time there is more input available from sys.stdin and another value is yielded**
