Example Answer:
The yield statement produces a value to be yielded from a generator function. In this case, we are yielding a value. Since the value yielded is not assigned to any variable, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, for the loop to execute another time there is more input available from sys.stdin and another value is yielded**
