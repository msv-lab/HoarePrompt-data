According to the code, the loop execution depends on the input line being split into values. If there are more values to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input. For the loop to execute one more time, the input line must contain more values to be split.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, and the program is waiting for the next input that contains more values to be split for the loop to execute again**
