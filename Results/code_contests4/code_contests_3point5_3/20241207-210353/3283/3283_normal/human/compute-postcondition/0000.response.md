Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the absolute value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since the input is integer `x`, `n` will be assigned the absolute value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109; `n` is the absolute value of `x`.
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109; `n` is the absolute value of `x`**
