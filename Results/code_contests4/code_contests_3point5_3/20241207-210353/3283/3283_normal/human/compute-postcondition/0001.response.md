Example Answer:
The value of `n` is the absolute value of `x`, so it can be any non-negative integer. The value of `d` is calculated based on the formula provided, which involves calculating the square root and ceiling function. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the value of `d` will also be an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109; `n` is the absolute value of `x`; `d` is an integer.
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109; `n` is the absolute value of `x`; `d` is an integer**
