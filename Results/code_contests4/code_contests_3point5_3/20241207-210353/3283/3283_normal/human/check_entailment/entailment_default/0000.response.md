Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately calculates the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x as described in the problem statement.
- It calculates the absolute value of the input, performs the necessary mathematical operations involving square root and ceiling functions, and then prints the result based on a nested list lookup.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement for all valid inputs within the specified range.
- Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
