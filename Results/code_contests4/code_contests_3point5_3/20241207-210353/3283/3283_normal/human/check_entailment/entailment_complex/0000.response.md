Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x based on the problem description. It first calculates the absolute value of the input, then performs a mathematical operation to determine the number of jumps needed, and finally prints the result based on a nested list lookup. The output of the program matches the expected output for all possible inputs within the specified range of -109 to 109. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
