Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x. It first calculates the absolute value of x, then uses a formula to calculate the minimal number of jumps needed based on the distance x. Finally, it prints the result by indexing into a pre-defined matrix. The program covers all potential cases of positive, negative, and zero values of x and correctly calculates the minimal number of jumps required.
