Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `n` is greater than 1, but it is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is the new input string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is the new input string**
