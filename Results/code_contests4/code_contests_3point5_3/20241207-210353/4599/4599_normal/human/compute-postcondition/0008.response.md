According to the code, the loop will execute based on the input integer `n`. If the input integer is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the input integer `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is the input string**
