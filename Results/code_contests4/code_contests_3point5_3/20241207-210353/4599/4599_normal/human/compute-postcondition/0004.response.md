According to the code, the loop executes based on the input value of `n`. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the input integer `n` must still be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is the input string**
