Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is directly dependent on the user input, so the value of `s` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is the input string**
