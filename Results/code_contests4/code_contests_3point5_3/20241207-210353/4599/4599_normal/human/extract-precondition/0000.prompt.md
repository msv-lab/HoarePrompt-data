You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1. Two binary strings a and b of equal length are similar, if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer i such that a_i = b_i). For example:

  * 10010 and 01111 are similar (they have the same character in position 4); 
  * 10010 and 11111 are similar; 
  * 111 and 111 are similar; 
  * 0110 and 1001 are not similar. 



You are given an integer n and a binary string s consisting of 2n-1 characters. Let's denote s[l..r] as the contiguous substring of s starting with l-th character and ending with r-th character (in other words, s[l..r] = s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} ... s_r).

You have to construct a binary string w of length n which is similar to all of the following strings: s[1..n], s[2..n+1], s[3..n+2], ..., s[n..2n-1].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The second line of each test case contains the binary string s of length 2n - 1. Each character s_i is either 0 or 1.

Output

For each test case, print the corresponding binary string w of length n. If there are multiple such strings — print any of them. It can be shown that at least one string w meeting the constraints always exists.

Example

Input

00000

1110000
2
101


Output


1
000
1010
00

Note

The explanation of the sample case (equal characters in equal positions are bold):

The first test case: 

  * 1 is similar to s[1..1] = 1. 



The second test case: 

  * 000 is similar to s[1..3] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[2..4] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[3..5] = 000. 



The third test case: 

  * 1010 is similar to s[1..4] = 1110; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[2..5] = 1100; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[3..6] = 1000; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[4..7] = 0000. 



The fourth test case: 

  * 00 is similar to s[1..2] = 10; 
  * 00 is similar to s[2..3] = 01. 
Function definition:

def func_5(f, *dim):
