Correctness: **False**

The code provided seems to be incorrect based on the problem description and the output hints. The function `func_1` reads the binary string `s` and prints every second character of `s`, which does not align with the requirement of constructing a binary string `w` of length `n` that is similar to all the given substrings. The function does not construct the required binary string `w` as per the problem description. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect solution.
