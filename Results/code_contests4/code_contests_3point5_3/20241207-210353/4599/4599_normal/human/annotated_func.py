#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        print(s[::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will execute as many times as specified by the user input. After all iterations, `n` will be the last input integer greater than 0, `s` will be the last input string, and every second character of the last `s` input will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads user input to determine the number of iterations for a loop. Within each iteration, it reads an integer `n`, a string `s`, and prints every second character of `s`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by converting each element of the input separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each element into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element is obtained by adding the integer value of each element in the input separated by spaces to the value of variable 'o'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts a parameter 'o' and adds the integer value of each element in the input separated by spaces to 'o'. It then returns a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and m is a binary string of length 2n-1 consisting of only 0s and 1s.**
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of the results of calling func_2() n times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. The function then returns a list of the results of calling func_2() n times. The precondition specifies that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 50, and `m` is a binary string of length 2n-1 consisting of only 0s and 1s.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer. n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. s is a binary string of length 2n - 1. Each character in s is either 0 or 1.**
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values calculated by calling func_5 with the arguments unpacked from dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times. If dim is empty, the program returns the result of calling f().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `f`, which is a function. It then returns a list of values calculated by repeatedly calling `func_5` with the arguments unpacked from `dim[1:]`, repeated `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, the function returns the result of calling `f()`. The function does not explicitly define the variable `dim`, so there may be an issue with missing or incorrect inputs, potentially leading to errors in execution.
