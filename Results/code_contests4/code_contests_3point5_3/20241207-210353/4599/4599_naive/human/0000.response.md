Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program only outputs the even-indexed characters of the input string, which is not in line with the problem requirements. The program should construct a binary string 'w' of length 'n' that is similar to all the specified substrings in the input string 's'. 

For example, for the input:
```
4
1
1
3
00000
4
1110000
2
101
```
The expected outputs should be:
```
1
000
1010
00
```
However, the program's output is incorrect as it does not construct the binary string 'w' as required by the problem description.
