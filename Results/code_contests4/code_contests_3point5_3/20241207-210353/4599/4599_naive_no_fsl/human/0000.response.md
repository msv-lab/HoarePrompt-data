Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the number of test cases, the length of the binary string, and the binary string itself. It then prints a binary string of length n that is similar to all the substrings as required by the problem description. The program achieves this by taking every 2nd character of the input binary string to construct the output binary string.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and there are no edge cases or scenarios provided in the description where the program might fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
