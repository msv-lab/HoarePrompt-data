Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for the given positive integers A_1,...,A_N based on the provided problem description. The program correctly implements the necessary mathematical operations and logic to handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. The program also correctly handles the input format and outputs the result modulo (10^9 + 7). Since the program logic aligns with the problem description and passes all the provided test cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.
