The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, and stores it in variable `c`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from `c`. The function then returns the integer value of `c`. However, the code does not handle the case when the input `mod` is not defined or not provided, which can lead to a NameError.
