The function `func_6` reads an integer `n` from the user input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the prime factors and their counts for each integer in the list. Afterward, it finds the least common multiple of these prime factors. Finally, it computes a result based on the least common multiple and some other functions, and prints the final integer result. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs the final result based on the input constraints.
