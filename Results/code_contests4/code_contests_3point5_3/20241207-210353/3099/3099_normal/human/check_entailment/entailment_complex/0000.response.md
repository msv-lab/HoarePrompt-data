Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code correctly implements the problem statement. The code effectively calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for the given positive integers A_1,...,A_N, satisfying the specified condition. The code handles the constraints of the input parameters and correctly calculates the result modulo (10^9 + 7). Additionally, the annotations provide insights into the functionality of each function, confirming that the code aligns with the problem description. Furthermore, no potential case or edge case was identified where the code does not work as expected based on the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
