Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for the given positive integers A_1,...,A_N while satisfying the condition specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the least common multiple of the prime factors of the input integers and then computes the final result according to the conditions provided. The program follows the problem description and ensures that the output is within the specified constraints.
