You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given are N positive integers A_1,...,A_N.

Consider positive integers B_1, ..., B_N that satisfy the following condition.

Condition: For any i, j such that 1 \leq i < j \leq N, A_i B_i = A_j B_j holds.

Find the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for such B_1,...,B_N.

Since the answer can be enormous, print the sum modulo (10^9 +7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^4
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for B_1,...,B_N that satisfy the condition, modulo (10^9 +7).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, `c`, and `mod` are integers. If `c` is less than `mod`, then the program fragment does not change the state of any variables.
    return c
    #The program returns the integer value of variable 'c'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, and stores it in variable `c`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from `c`. The function then returns the integer value of `c`. However, the code does not handle the case when the input `mod` is not defined or not provided, which can lead to a NameError.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the result of multiplying variables 'a' and 'b' and then taking the modulo 'mod' of the result
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts two parameters a and b, multiplies them, and then takes the modulo 'mod' of the result.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the value 1
    else :
        if (b % 2 == 1) :
            return func_2(a, func_3(a, b - 1))
            #The program returns the result of calling function func_2 with arguments a and the result of calling function func_3 with arguments a and b-1
        else :
            temp = func_3(a, b / 2)
            return func_2(temp, temp)
            #The program returns the value returned by func_2(temp, temp), where temp is the value returned by func_3(a, 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. It evaluates three cases:
- Case 1: If `b` is 0, the function returns 1.
- Case 2: If `b` is odd, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with arguments `a` and the result of calling `func_3` with arguments `a` and `b-1`.
- Case 3: If `b` is even, the function calculates `temp` by calling `func_3(a, b / 2)` and returns the result of calling `func_2` with `temp` as both arguments. However, the annotation mentions `func_3(a, 0)`, which is misleading since `b / 2` would not reduce `b` to 0. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` includes handling cases based on the parity of `b` and making recursive calls to `func_2` and `func_3` accordingly.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4(a):
    return func_3(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of calling function `func_3` with arguments `a` and `mod - 2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `a` and returns the result of calling function `func_3` with arguments `a` and `mod - 2`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(a, m):
    m0 = m
    y = 0
    x = 1
    if (m == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m0` is assigned the value of `m`, `y` is 0, `x` is 1. `m` is not equal to 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        
        t = m
        
        m = a % m
        
        a = t
        
        t = y
        
        y = x - q * y
        
        x = t
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `m0` is assigned the value of `m`, `y` is the updated value after executing the code, `x` is now equal to the previous value of `t`, `m` is not equal to 1, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `t`, `q` is the calculated floor division of `a` and `m`, `t` is now equal to the previous value of `y`, `m` is the result of `a % m`, `a` is now equal to the value of `t`, `t` is assigned the value of `y`, `y` is updated to `x - q * y`. The loop control variable `a` will eventually become 1 and the loop will terminate.
    if (x < 0) :
        x = x + m0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m`, `y`, `x`, `t`, `a`, `q` are integers. Initially, `m0` is assigned the value of `m`. After the execution of the if statement, `y` is updated to a new value, `x` takes the value of the previous `t`, `m` is not equal to 1, `a` takes the previous value of `t`, `q` is the floor division of `a` and `m`, `t` takes the previous value of `y`, `m` is the result of the modulus operation of `a` and `m`, `a` is assigned the value of `t`, `t` takes the value of `y`, and `y` is updated to `x - q * y`. The loop control variable `a` eventually becomes 1 and the loop terminates. Additionally, `x` is updated to `x + m0` after the execution of the if statement.
    return x
    #The program returns the final value of integer `x` after the execution of the code snippet
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `a` and `m`. It performs a series of calculations on `a` and `m` values using a loop until `a` reaches 1. If the initial value of `m` is 1, the function returns 0. After the loop terminates, if the value of `x` is negative, it is adjusted by adding the initial value of `m`. The function then returns the final value of integer `x`. The function provides two possible outcomes: returning 0 or the calculated final value of `x` based on the input parameters `a` and `m`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer. A_1, ..., A_N are positive integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i from 1 to N.**
def func_6():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    answer = {}
    for i in range(n):
        cnt = {}
        
        x = arr[i]
        
        i = 2
        
        while i * i <= x:
            while x % i == 0:
                x /= i
                cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1
            i += 1
        
        if x != 1:
            cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        for key in cnt:
            answer[key] = max(answer.get(key, 0), cnt[key])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', 'i' is equal to `2n + 2 + k`, `n` is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of all elements in 'arr' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to 1, 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by the total number of times the loop executed, `k` is the total number of times the loop executed. If x is not equal to 1, `cnt[x]` is updated by incrementing its previous value by 1
    lcm = 1
    for prime in answer:
        for _ in range(answer[prime]):
            lcm = func_2(lcm, prime)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 'answer' is not empty, 'i' is equal to 2n + 2 + k, 'n' is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of all elements in 'arr' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to the key 'prime' from 'answer', 'cnt[x]' has been updated by the total number of times the loop executed, 'k' is the total number of times the loop executed, 'lcm' is set to the least common multiple of all primes in 'answer'
    ans = 0
    for x in arr:
        ans = func_1(ans, func_2(lcm, func_4(x)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 'answer' is not empty, 'i' is equal to 2n + 2 + k, 'n' is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of all elements in 'arr' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to the key 'prime' from 'answer', 'cnt[x]' has been updated by the total number of times the loop executed + k, 'k' is the total number of times the loop executed, 'lcm' is set to the least common multiple of all primes in 'answer', 'ans' is updated to the final result after executing all iterations of the loop
    ans = int(ans)
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads an integer `n` from the user input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the prime factors and their counts for each integer in the list. Afterward, it finds the least common multiple of these prime factors. Finally, it computes a result based on the least common multiple and some other functions, and prints the final integer result. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs the final result based on the input constraints.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
