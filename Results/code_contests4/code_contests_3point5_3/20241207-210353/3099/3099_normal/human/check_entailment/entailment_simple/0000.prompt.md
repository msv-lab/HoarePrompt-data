You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given are N positive integers A_1,...,A_N.

Consider positive integers B_1, ..., B_N that satisfy the following condition.

Condition: For any i, j such that 1 \leq i < j \leq N, A_i B_i = A_j B_j holds.

Find the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for such B_1,...,B_N.

Since the answer can be enormous, print the sum modulo (10^9 +7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^4
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for B_1,...,B_N that satisfy the condition, modulo (10^9 +7).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, `c`, and `mod` are integers. If `c` is less than `mod`, then the program fragment does not change the state of any variables.
    return c
    #The program returns the integer value of variable 'c'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the result of multiplying variables 'a' and 'b' and then taking the modulo 'mod' of the result

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the value 1
    else :
        if (b % 2 == 1) :
            return func_2(a, func_3(a, b - 1))
            #The program returns the result of calling function func_2 with arguments a and the result of calling function func_3 with arguments a and b-1
        else :
            temp = func_3(a, b / 2)
            return func_2(temp, temp)
            #The program returns the value returned by func_2(temp, temp), where temp is the value returned by func_3(a, 0)

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4(a):
    return func_3(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of calling function `func_3` with arguments `a` and `mod - 2`

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(a, m):
    m0 = m
    y = 0
    x = 1
    if (m == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m0` is assigned the value of `m`, `y` is 0, `x` is 1. `m` is not equal to 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        
        t = m

        a = t
        
        t = y
        
        y = x - q * y
        
        x = t
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `m0` is assigned the value of `m`, `y` is the updated value after executing the code, `x` is now equal to the previous value of `t`, `m` is not equal to 1, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `t`, `q` is the calculated floor division of `a` and `m`, `t` is now equal to the previous value of `y`, `m` is the result of `a % m`, `a` is now equal to the value of `t`, `t` is assigned the value of `y`, `y` is updated to `x - q * y`. The loop control variable `a` will eventually become 1 and the loop will terminate.
    if (x < 0) :
        x = x + m0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m`, `y`, `x`, `t`, `a`, `q` are integers. Initially, `m0` is assigned the value of `m`. After the execution of the if statement, `y` is updated to a new value, `x` takes the value of the previous `t`, `m` is not equal to 1, `a` takes the previous value of `t`, `q` is the floor division of `a` and `m`, `t` takes the previous value of `y`, `m` is the result of the modulus operation of `a` and `m`, `a` is assigned the value of `t`, `t` takes the value of `y`, and `y` is updated to `x - q * y`. The loop control variable `a` eventually becomes 1 and the loop terminates. Additionally, `x` is updated to `x + m0` after the execution of the if statement.
    return x
    #The program returns the final value of integer `x` after the execution of the code snippet

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
