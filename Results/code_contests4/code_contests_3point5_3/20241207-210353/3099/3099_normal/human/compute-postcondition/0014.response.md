According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x % i` equals 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the result of `arr[2]` divided by 2, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `x % i` must equal 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`answer` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with key 2 and value 2, `x` is the result of `arr[2]` divided by 2 and for the loop to execute again `x % i` must equal 0**
