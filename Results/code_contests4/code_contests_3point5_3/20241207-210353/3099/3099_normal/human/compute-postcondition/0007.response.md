According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 2 and `x` is assigned the value of `arr[2]`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`answer` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is assigned the value of `arr[2]`**
