Example Answer:
The input is split into individual integers and stored in the list `arr`. The values of `A_1, ..., A_N` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, A_1, ..., A_N are positive integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i from 1 to N, n is an input integer; arr contains the integers inputted.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, A_1, ..., A_N are positive integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i from 1 to N, n is an input integer; arr contains the integers inputted**
