According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `answer` is an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`answer` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
