According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `x % i == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` must be divisible by `i`
- `i` must be less than or equal to `n`
- `cnt[i]` needs to be incremented by 1

State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is the value of arr[i] divided by 2, 'arr' has at least 3 elements, 'cnt' has at least 1 key-value pair, for the loop to execute `x` must be divisible by `i`, `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1**
