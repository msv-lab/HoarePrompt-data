Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is converted to an integer using the `int()` function. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 'answer' is not empty, 'i' is equal to 2n + 2 + k, 'n' is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of all elements in 'arr' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to the key 'prime' from 'answer', 'cnt[x]' has been updated by the total number of times the loop executed + k, 'k' is the total number of times the loop executed, 'lcm' is set to the least common multiple of all primes in 'answer', 'ans' is updated to the final result after executing all iterations of the loop.
