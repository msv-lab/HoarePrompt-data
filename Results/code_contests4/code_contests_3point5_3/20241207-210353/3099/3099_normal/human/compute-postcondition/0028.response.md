Example Answer: 
`cnt[i]` is updated by incrementing the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` is initially 1, `cnt[1]` will be updated to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `answer` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` has keys 1, 2, and 3 with values equal to the number of times `x` is divisible by 2 and incremented by 1 respectively, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `x` is the result of `arr[2]` divided by 8, for the loop to execute again `x % i` should be equal to 0.
