Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by the value of `i`, which is 2. Since the initial state mentions that `x` is assigned the value of `arr[2]`, and `i` is 2, the result of the division will be the value at index 2 of `arr` divided by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `answer` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is the result of `arr[2]` divided by 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements.
Output State: **`answer` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is the result of `arr[2]` divided by 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements**
