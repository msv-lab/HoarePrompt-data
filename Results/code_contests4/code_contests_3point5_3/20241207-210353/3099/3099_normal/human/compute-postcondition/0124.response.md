Output State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is n+2, `n` is greater than 2, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is divisible by all prime factors of 'arr[2]' in 'cnt' and not equal to 1, 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by the number of times the loop executed, `x` is divided by n, `cnt[i]` is incremented by n-1 for the loop to execute the first time x must be divisible by n+2, `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1.**
