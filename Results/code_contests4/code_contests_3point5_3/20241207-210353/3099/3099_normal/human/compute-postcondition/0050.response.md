Example Answer: 
The code updates the value associated with 'key' in the 'answer' dictionary to be the maximum of the current value stored in 'answer' for 'key' and the value stored in 'cnt' for 'key'. The initial state shows that 'answer' already contains the maximum value for each 'key', 'i' has a value such that i*i is greater than 'x', 'n' is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' and 'x' is 1. Since 'x' is equal to 1, the count of 'x' in 'cnt' is not incremented. Therefore, the Output State is: 'answer' is updated with the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' and the existing values associated with 'key' in 'answer', 'i' is such that i*i is greater than 'x', 'n' is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is still 1, 'arr' has at least 3 elements, and 'cnt' has at least 2 key-value pairs after the loop executes the second time.
Output State: **'answer' is updated with the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' and the existing values associated with 'key' in 'answer', 'i' is such that i*i is greater than 'x', 'n' is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is still 1, 'arr' has at least 3 elements, and 'cnt' has at least 2 key-value pairs after the loop executes the second time**
