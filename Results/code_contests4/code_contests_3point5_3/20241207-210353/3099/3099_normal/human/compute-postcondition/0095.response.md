Postcondition: ***'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is the smallest prime factor of 'x' greater than 2, `n` is greater than 1, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is 1, 'arr' has at least 3 elements, 'cnt' has at least 1 key-value pair, `x` is divisible by all the prime factors of 'arr[2]' present in 'cnt', 'i' is such that it no longer divides 'x', 'i' is incremented by 1, and 'x' is not equal to 1***.
