According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `x % i == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` must be divisible by the new value of `i`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- The value of `i` is `n + n + 1 + 1`, which can be simplified to `2n + 2`.
- The value of `n` is greater than 3.
- 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values.
- 'x' is divisible by all prime factors of 'arr[2]' in 'cnt' and not equal to 1.
- 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by the number of times the loop executed.
- `x` is divided by 1, which means it remains unchanged.
- `cnt[i]` is incremented by `n-1`.
- `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Update the value of `i` to be `2n + 2 + 1`, as it needs to be incremented for the next iteration.
- Increment the value of `cnt[i]` by 1, as it needs to be updated for the next iteration.
- No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.
