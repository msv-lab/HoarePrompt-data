Output State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is the last value that divides 'x' incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is divisible by 4, `arr` has at least 3 elements, 'cnt' has at least 1 key-value pair, `cnt[2]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, `x` is divided by all the prime factors of 'arr[2]' present in 'cnt', `cnt[i]` is updated with the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1, and `cnt[i]` is updated with the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1.**
