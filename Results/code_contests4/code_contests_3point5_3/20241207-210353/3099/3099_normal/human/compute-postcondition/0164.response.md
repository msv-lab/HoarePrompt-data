Example Answer: 
The value of `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2(lcm, prime)`. The loop will execute one more time only if the value corresponding to the key 'prime' in 'answer' is greater than 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 'answer' is not empty, 'i' is equal to 2n + 2 + k, 'n' is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of all elements in 'arr' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to the key 'prime' from 'answer', 'cnt[x]' has been updated, 'k' is the total number of times the loop executed, 'lcm' is updated by `func_2(lcm, prime)`, loop will execute one more time if the value corresponding to the key 'prime' in 'answer' is greater than 1.
Output State: **'answer' is not empty, 'i' is equal to 2n + 2 + k, 'n' is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of all elements in 'arr' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to the key 'prime' from 'answer', 'cnt[x]' has been updated, 'k' is the total number of times the loop executed, 'lcm' is updated by `func_2(lcm, prime)`, loop will execute one more time if the value corresponding to the key 'prime' in 'answer' is greater than 1**
