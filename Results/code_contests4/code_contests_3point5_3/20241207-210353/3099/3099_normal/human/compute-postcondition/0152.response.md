Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the 'answer' dictionary by taking the maximum between the current value of 'answer[key]' and 'cnt[key]'. This is done for all keys in 'cnt'. The loop executes 'k' times, and for each iteration, 'cnt[x]' is updated by incrementing its previous value by the number of times the loop executed. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that 'cnt' must contain at least one more key-value pair compared to the end of the previous iteration, and the key for which the loop is currently iterating should not have reached its maximum value yet. 'i' is updated to reflect the new value after the loop executes. 'n' is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: 'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', 'i' is updated to reflect the new value after the loop executes, 'n' is greater than 1, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to 1, 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by the number of times the loop executed, 'k' is the total number of times the loop executed.
Output State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', 'i' is updated to reflect the new value after the loop executes, 'n' is greater than 1, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to 1, 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by the number of times the loop executed, 'k' is the total number of times the loop executed**
