Output State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', 'i' is equal to `2n + 2 + k`, `n` is greater than 0, 'cnt' contains prime factors of all elements in 'arr' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is equal to 1, 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by the total number of times the loop executed, `k` is the total number of times the loop executed. If x is not equal to 1, `cnt[x]` is updated by incrementing its previous value by 1, `lcm` is set to 1**
