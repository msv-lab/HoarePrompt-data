According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be at least 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`answer` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with key 2 and value equal to the number of times `x` is divisible by 2, `x` is the result of `arr[2]` divided by 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, for the loop to execute again `i` should be at least 4**
