Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty dictionary `cnt`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is the smallest prime factor of 'x' greater than 2 and has been incremented until it no longer divides 'x', `n` is greater than 1 and incremented by 1, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is not equal to 1 and divisible by all the prime factors of 'arr[2]' present in 'cnt', 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by the number of times the loop executed. `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**
