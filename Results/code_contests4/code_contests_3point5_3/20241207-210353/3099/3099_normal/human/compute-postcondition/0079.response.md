Example Answer:
The value of `cnt[i]` is updated to `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. Since `i` is 5, this means `cnt[5]` will be updated to its previous value (if it exists) plus 1. The other variables remain the same as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: 'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 1, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is divisible by 4, `arr` has at least 3 elements, 'cnt' has at least 1 key-value pair, `cnt[2]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, `x` is divided by 4, `cnt[i]` is updated with the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`, for the loop to execute again `x` needs to be divisible by 6 and `cnt[6]` needs to be updated.
