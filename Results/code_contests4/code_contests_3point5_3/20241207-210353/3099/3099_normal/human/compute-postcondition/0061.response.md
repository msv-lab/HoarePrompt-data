Output State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is the value of arr[i] divided by 2, 'arr' has at least 3 elements, 'cnt' has at least 1 key-value pair for the loop to execute the first time, `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`, for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be divisible by 2 and `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1**
