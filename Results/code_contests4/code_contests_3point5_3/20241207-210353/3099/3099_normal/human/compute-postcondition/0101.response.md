Example Answer: 
The value of 'answer[key]' is updated to be the maximum of the current value and 'cnt[key]'. 'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', so after the execution of the code, 'answer[key]' is updated accordingly. The value of 'i' is the smallest prime factor of 'x' greater than 2, and it is incremented by 1. 'x' is not equal to 1 and 'x' is divisible by all the prime factors of 'arr[2]' present in 'cnt'. 'cnt[x]' is updated by incrementing its previous value by 1. 'n' and 'arr' are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: 'answer' is a dictionary containing the updated maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is the smallest prime factor of 'x' greater than 2 and has been incremented by 1, 'x' is not equal to 1 and is still divisible by all the prime factors of 'arr[2]' present in 'cnt', 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by 1.
Output State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the updated maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is the smallest prime factor of 'x' greater than 2 and has been incremented by 1, 'x' is not equal to 1 and is still divisible by all the prime factors of 'arr[2]' present in 'cnt', 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by 1**
