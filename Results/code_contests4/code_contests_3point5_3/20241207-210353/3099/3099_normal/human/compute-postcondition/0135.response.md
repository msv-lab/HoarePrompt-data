Output State: **'answer' is a dictionary containing the maximum values of 'cnt[key]' for all keys in 'cnt', `i` is `n + n + 1 + 1`, `n` is greater than 3, 'cnt' contains prime factors of 'arr[2]' as keys and their corresponding count as values, 'x' is divisible by all prime factors of 'arr[2]' in 'cnt' and not equal to 1, 'cnt[x]' has been updated by incrementing its previous value by the number of times the loop executed, `x` is divided by 1, `cnt[i]` is incremented by `n-1'**
