Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for the given N positive integers A_1,...,A_N. The program follows the condition mentioned in the problem description and calculates the answer modulo (10^9 + 7) as required. The program uses various functions to handle the calculations and loops through the input array to compute the result accurately. Since the program follows the problem description and produces correct output for the given examples, it can be considered correct.
