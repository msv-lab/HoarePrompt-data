The function `func_5` reads input from the user and returns it after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is expected to handle the input validations mentioned in the preconditions such as ensuring `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `k` is between 0 and `n-1`, and the array elements `a_i` are positive integers within the specified range. The function should also handle cases where the input does not meet these criteria or is not properly formatted.
