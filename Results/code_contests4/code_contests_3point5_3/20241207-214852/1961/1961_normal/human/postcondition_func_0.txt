The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The function does not have a specific return value specified in the given constraints. The function operates under the precondition that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements `a_i` are positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
