Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to accurately solve the given problem description. It takes multiple test cases as input and for each test case, it calculates the largest integer `x` such that, no matter what are the choices of the friends you didn't choose to control, the element you will take from the array will be greater than or equal to `x`. The function `func_8` handles the main logic of recursively calculating the maximum element you can obtain based on the choices made by your friends. The code seems to cover all the potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is as expected. The functions provided handle the input reading, processing, and output formatting effectively, meeting the requirements of the problem description. Since all the examples are covered correctly, we can conclude that the code is correct.
