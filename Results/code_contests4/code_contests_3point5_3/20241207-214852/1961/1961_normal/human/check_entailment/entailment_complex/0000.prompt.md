You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your n - 1 friends have found an array of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. You have decided to share it in the following way: All n of you stand in a line in a particular order. Each minute, the person at the front of the line chooses either the first or the last element of the array, removes it, and keeps it for himself. He then gets out of line, and the next person in line continues the process.

You are standing in the m-th position in the line. Before the process starts, you may choose up to k different people in the line, and persuade them to always take either the first or the last element in the array on their turn (for each person his own choice, not necessarily equal for all people), no matter what the elements themselves are. Once the process starts, you cannot persuade any more people, and you cannot change the choices for the people you already persuaded.

Suppose that you're doing your choices optimally. What is the greatest integer x such that, no matter what are the choices of the friends you didn't choose to control, the element you will take from the array will be greater than or equal to x?

Please note that the friends you don't control may do their choice arbitrarily, and they will not necessarily take the biggest element available.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of elements in the array, your position in line and the number of people whose choices you can fix.

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.

Output

For each test case, print the largest integer x such that you can guarantee to obtain at least x.

Note

In the first test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the last element and the second person to take the first element.

  * the first person will take the last element (5) because he or she was forced by you to take the last element. After this turn the remaining array will be [2, 9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * the second person will take the first element (2) because he or she was forced by you to take the first element. After this turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * if the third person will choose to take the first element (9), at your turn the remaining array will be [2, 3, 8] and you will take 8 (the last element); 
  * if the third person will choose to take the last element (8), at your turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3] and you will take 9 (the first element). 



Thus, this strategy guarantees to end up with at least 8. We can prove that there is no strategy that guarantees to end up with at least 9. Hence, the answer is 8.

In the second test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the first element. Then, in the worst case, both the second and the third person will take the first element: you will end up with 4.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The function does not have a specific return value specified in the given constraints. The function operates under the precondition that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements `a_i` are positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s` and prints the value of `s` followed by a new line. The functionality beyond this is not specified in the given information.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln().strip())
    #The program returns an integer after reading and stripping the input line
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads and strips the input line, then returns an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns the result of applying the 'int' function to each element of the input obtained from 'readln().split()'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input and splits it, then converts each element into an integer using the `int` function. It returns a list of integers obtained from the input. The code does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to input validation or handling exceptions.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_5():
    return readln().strip()
    #The program returns the input read from the user after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads input from the user and returns it after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is expected to handle the input validations mentioned in the preconditions such as ensuring `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `k` is between 0 and `n-1`, and the array elements `a_i` are positive integers within the specified range. The function should also handle cases where the input does not meet these criteria or is not properly formatted.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings that are input from the user after splitting them based on spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads input from the user, splits the input based on spaces, and returns a list of strings. However, it is missing error handling for cases where the input is not provided or where the input is empty. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a string.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If the program is in debug mode, then the function executes in debug mode. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. If the program is in debug mode, it prints the arguments passed. Otherwise, it does not perform any specific action. The function does not return any value.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **

    for pi in xrange(pri_idx, len(prilist) - 1):
        v, pl, pr = prilist[pi]
        
        lcut = max(0, pl - l + 1)
        
        rcut = max(0, r - pr + 1)

            return ans
        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `rcut` will be the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `lcut` will be less than or equal to k, and r - pl will be greater than or equal to seglen. The value of `ans` will be updated based on the maximum value determined by the function calls within the loop. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the loop will continue to the next iteration or statement. If `ans` is true at any point, the loop will return the updated value of `ans` based on the maximum value determined by the function calls. Otherwise, the loop will break out of the loop and the values of the variables `rcut`, `lcut`, `ans`, and `pri_idx` will remain unchanged.
    ans = 10000000000.0

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the maximum value of all `A` elements within the range `seglen` and `A` elements within the range `[i,i+seglen-1]`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `i` is adjusted, `seglen` is adjusted. If at any point `i + seglen - 1 > r`, the loop will terminate.
    return ans
    #The program returns the updated minimum value of the maximum elements within the specified ranges based on the given conditions
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen`. It iterates through `prilist` elements, adjusting values based on certain conditions. If specific conditions are met within the loop, it recursively calls itself to update the `ans` value. After the loop, it calculates the minimum value of the maximum elements within specified ranges and returns this value. The function handles different scenarios where `ans` can be updated and returned. However, the actual functionality may deviate from the annotations due to potential missing cases or edge conditions.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
