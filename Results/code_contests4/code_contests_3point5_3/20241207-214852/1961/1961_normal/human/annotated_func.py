#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The function does not have a specific return value specified in the given constraints. The function operates under the precondition that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements `a_i` are positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s` and prints the value of `s` followed by a new line. The functionality beyond this is not specified in the given information.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln().strip())
    #The program returns an integer after reading and stripping the input line
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads and strips the input line, then returns an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns the result of applying the 'int' function to each element of the input obtained from 'readln().split()'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input and splits it, then converts each element into an integer using the `int` function. It returns a list of integers obtained from the input. The code does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to input validation or handling exceptions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_5():
    return readln().strip()
    #The program returns the input read from the user after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads input from the user and returns it after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is expected to handle the input validations mentioned in the preconditions such as ensuring `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `k` is between 0 and `n-1`, and the array elements `a_i` are positive integers within the specified range. The function should also handle cases where the input does not meet these criteria or is not properly formatted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings that are input from the user after splitting them based on spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads input from the user, splits the input based on spaces, and returns a list of strings. However, it is missing error handling for cases where the input is not provided or where the input is empty. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a string.

def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If the program is in debug mode, then the function executes in debug mode. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. If the program is in debug mode, it prints the arguments passed. Otherwise, it does not perform any specific action. The function does not return any value.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `rcut` will be the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `lcut` will be less than or equal to k, and r - pl will be greater than or equal to seglen. The value of `ans` will be updated based on the maximum value determined by the function calls within the loop. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the loop will continue to the next iteration or statement. If `ans` is true at any point, the loop will return the updated value of `ans` based on the maximum value determined by the function calls. Otherwise, the loop will break out of the loop and the values of the variables `rcut`, `lcut`, `ans`, and `pri_idx` will remain unchanged.

If at any point `i + seglen - 1 > r`, the loop will terminate.
    return ans
    #The program returns the updated minimum value of the maximum elements within the specified ranges based on the given conditions
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen`. It iterates through `prilist` elements, adjusting values based on certain conditions. If specific conditions are met within the loop, it recursively calls itself to update the `ans` value. After the loop, it calculates the minimum value of the maximum elements within specified ranges and returns this value. The function handles different scenarios where `ans` can be updated and returned. However, the actual functionality may deviate from the annotations due to potential missing cases or edge conditions.
