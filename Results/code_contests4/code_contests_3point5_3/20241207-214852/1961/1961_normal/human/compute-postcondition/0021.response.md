Example Answer:
`rcut` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `r - pr + 1`. The values of `r`, `pr`, and `rcut` are not provided, so the output state is: `rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`.
Output State: **`rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`**
