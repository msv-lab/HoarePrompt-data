Example Answer:
The value of `lcut` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the value of `pl - l + 1`. The previous values of `pl`, `l`, and `lcut` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `lcut`. Therefore, the Output State is: `rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `lcut` is less than or equal to k and r - pl is greater than or equal to seglen. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement. `ans` is updated based on the maximum value determined by the function call. For the loop to execute one more time, `pri_idx` needs to be incremented by 1 and `pri_idx` should still be less than the length of `prilist` - 1.
