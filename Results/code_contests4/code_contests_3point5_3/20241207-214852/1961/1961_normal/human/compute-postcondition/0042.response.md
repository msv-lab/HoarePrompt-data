Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `rcut` remains the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `lcut` is still less than or equal to k, and r - pl is still greater than or equal to seglen. `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between the current value of `ans` and the result of the function call `func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`. `pri_idx` is incremented by 1, and `pri_idx` is still less than the length of `prilist` - 1. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement. Additionally, `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between the current value of `ans` and the result of the function call `func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`.***
