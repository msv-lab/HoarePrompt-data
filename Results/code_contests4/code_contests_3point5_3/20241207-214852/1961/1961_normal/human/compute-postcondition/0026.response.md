Postcondition: ***`rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `lcut` is less than or equal to k and r - pl is greater than or equal to seglen. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement. `ans` is updated based on the maximum value determined by the function call.***
