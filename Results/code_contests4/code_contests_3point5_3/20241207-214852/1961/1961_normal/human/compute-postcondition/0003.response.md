Example Answer:
`rcut` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the result of `r - pr + 1`. The previous values of `r`, `pr`, and `pi` determine the value of `rcut`. Therefore, the Output State is: rcut is the maximum of 0 and the value of r - pr + 1.
Output State: **rcut is the maximum of 0 and the value of r - pr + 1**
