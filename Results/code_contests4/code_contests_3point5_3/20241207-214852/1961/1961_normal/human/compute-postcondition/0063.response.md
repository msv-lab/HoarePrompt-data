The function `func_8` accepts parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen`. 

Case_1: The program returns the value of 'ans' after entering the if condition where 'ans' is true.

Case_2: The program returns the updated value of 'ans' based on the maximum value determined by the function call.
