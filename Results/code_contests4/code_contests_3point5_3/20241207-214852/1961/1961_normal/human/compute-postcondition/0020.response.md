Example Answer:
`lcut` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `pl - l + 1`. The initial state does not provide the values of `pl`, `l`, or `pi`, so the exact value of `lcut` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `ans` is updated based on the result of `func_8` if the conditions are met, for the loop to execute another time, `v`, `pl`, and `pr` are assigned values from `prilist[pi]`, `lcut` is the maximum value between 0 and `pl - l + 1`.
Output State: **`rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `ans` is updated based on the result of `func_8` if the conditions are met, for the loop to execute another time, `v`, `pl`, and `pr` are assigned values from `prilist[pi]`, `lcut` is the maximum value between 0 and `pl - l + 1`**
