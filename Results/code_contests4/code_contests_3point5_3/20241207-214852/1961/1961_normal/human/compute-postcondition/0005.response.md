Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we are in. Therefore, the Output State is: `rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of r - pr + 1, if `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration.
Output State: **`rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of r - pr + 1, if `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration**
