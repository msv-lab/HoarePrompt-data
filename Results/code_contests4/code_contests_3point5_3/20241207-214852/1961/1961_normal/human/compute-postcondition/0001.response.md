Example Answer: 
`v, pl, pr` are assigned the values at index `pi` of the list `prilist`. Since `pi` is equal to `pri_idx`, `pri_idx` must be less than the length of `prilist` - 1 for the loop to execute. The values of `v, pl, pr` depend on the elements at index `pri_idx` of `prilist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pi` is equal to `pri_idx`, `prilist` has at least 2 elements, `v, pl, pr` are assigned values based on the elements at index `pi` of `prilist`.
Output State: **`pi` is equal to `pri_idx`, `prilist` has at least 2 elements, `v, pl, pr` are assigned values based on the elements at index `pi` of `prilist`**
