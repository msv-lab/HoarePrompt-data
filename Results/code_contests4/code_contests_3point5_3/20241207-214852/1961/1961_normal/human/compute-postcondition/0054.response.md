Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `i` needs to be adjusted, `seglen` is needed to be adjusted and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`ans` is updated, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `i` needs to be adjusted, `seglen` is needed to be adjusted and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
