Output State: **`rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `lcut` is less than or equal to k and r - pl is greater than or equal to seglen, `ans` is 0, `pri_idx` is incremented by 1, `pri_idx` is still less than the length of `prilist` - 1. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
