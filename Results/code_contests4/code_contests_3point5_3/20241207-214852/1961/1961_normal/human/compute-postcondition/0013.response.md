Postcondition: ***`rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of r - pr + 1. If `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration without any changes to the variables. `ans` is 0. If `lcut` is less than or equal to k and r - pl is greater than or equal to seglen, then the value of `ans` is updated based on the result of the function `func_8`, while other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, if rcut is less than or equal to k and pr - l is greater than or equal to seglen, the state of the program variables remain the same as described in the preconditions and postconditions of the if part.***
