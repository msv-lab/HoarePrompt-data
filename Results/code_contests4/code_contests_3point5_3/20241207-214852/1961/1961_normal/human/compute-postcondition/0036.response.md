Output State: **`rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`, `lcut` is less than or equal to k and r - pl is greater than or equal to seglen, `ans` is updated based on the maximum value determined by the function call. For the loop to execute one more time, `pri_idx` needs to be incremented by 1 and `pri_idx` should still be less than the length of `prilist` - 1, `rcut` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `r - pr + 1`**
