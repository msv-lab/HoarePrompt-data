Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the maximum value of all `A` elements within the range `seglen` and `A` elements within the range `[i,i+seglen-1]`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `i` is adjusted, `seglen` is adjusted. If at any point `i + seglen - 1 > r`, the loop will terminate.**
