According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pi`, `pri_idx`, and `prilist`. If `prilist` has at least 2 elements and `pri_idx` is less than the length of `prilist` - 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state such that `pi` is equal to `pri_idx` and `prilist` has at least 2 elements.
State: **`pi` is equal to `pri_idx`, `prilist` has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute `pri_idx` is less than the length of `prilist` - 1**
