Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and the result of the function `func_8` called with the updated parameters. The function `func_8` is called with `pl + 1` instead of `pl`, and other variables are passed as they are. The output state after execution is dependent on the return value of the `func_8` function, which is unknown based on the provided information.
Output State: **The value of `ans` is updated based on the result of the function `func_8`, other variables remain unchanged**
