Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimal amount of discrete jumps required for Vasya to reach the last skyscraper. The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum jumps required at each skyscraper. It iterates through the heights of the skyscrapers and updates the minimum jumps based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

The program handles cases where Vasya needs to jump to a higher or lower skyscraper while ensuring that all intermediate skyscrapers are strictly lower or higher than both the starting and ending skyscrapers. It maintains two stacks to keep track of the maximum and minimum heights encountered so far.

Overall, the program seems to cover all the conditions specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, it can be considered correct.
