Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program implements a solution to find the minimal amount of discrete jumps needed to reach the last skyscraper. It follows the conditions provided in the problem description for determining discrete jumps. The logic of maintaining two stacks (one for maximum values and one for minimum values) to keep track of potential jumps is correctly implemented. The program considers all possible cases and provides the correct output for the given examples. Since the program adheres to the problem description and provides the expected output for all cases, it can be considered correct.
