Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal amount of discrete jumps required for Vasya to reach the last skyscraper based on the given conditions in the problem description. The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum jumps required at each skyscraper while considering the heights of the skyscrapers.

The program iterates through the list of skyscraper heights, updating the minimum jumps required based on the conditions specified in the problem description. It maintains two stacks to keep track of the maximum and minimum heights encountered so far, allowing it to efficiently calculate the jumps required.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all test cases.
