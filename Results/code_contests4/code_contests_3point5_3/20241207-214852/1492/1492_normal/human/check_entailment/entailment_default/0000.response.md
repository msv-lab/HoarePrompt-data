Initial assessment: The provided code consists of multiple functions that work together to determine the minimal amount of discrete jumps required for Vasya to reach the last skyscraper. The code uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum jumps at each step while considering the height constraints between the skyscrapers.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it seems that the code aligns with the problem statement. The functions prompt the user for input, process the input data, and calculate the minimum number of jumps required according to the specified conditions. The logic behind the discrete jumps based on the heights of the skyscrapers is correctly implemented in the code.

Output hints verification: The output hints provide descriptions of each function and its purpose. They also mention the flow of operations within the code and the expected functionality. The hints agree with the code as they describe the input processing, dynamic programming approach, and the final output calculation based on the constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, after careful consideration and analysis, it can be concluded that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
