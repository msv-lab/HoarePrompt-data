You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the i-th one is h_i. Today some villains have set on fire first n - 1 of them, and now the only safety building is n-th skyscraper.

Let's call a jump from i-th skyscraper to j-th (i < j) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i < j and one of the following conditions satisfied: 

  * i + 1 = j 
  * max(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}) < min(h_i, h_j) 
  * max(h_i, h_j) < min(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}). 



At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach n-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — total amount of skyscrapers.

The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, …, h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — heights of skyscrapers.

Output

Print single number k — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

In the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5.

In the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.

Sequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: 1 → 3 → 5.

#Function 1:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop, `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n integers calculated based on the conditions within the loop; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is n-1; `x` is the last element in the list; `maxstack` and `maxidx` contain the maximum element and its index respectively; `minstack` and `minidx` contain the minimum element and its index respectively.
    debug_print(dp)
    print(dp[n - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from input and then calls `func_2` to get a list `ar`. It initializes various lists and variables based on the input. It then iterates through the elements of `ar`, updating a dynamic programming list `dp` based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the last element of `dp` after the loop ends. The function internally handles the constraints and operations based on the input, but the exact nature of these operations based on the logic inside the loop is not explicitly described in the annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input values provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prompts the user to input values, converts those input values to integers, and returns a list of integers. This function does not accept any parameters.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element is obtained by adding the integer value of each element separated by a space in the input to the value of variable 'o'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts a parameter `o` and returns a list of integers where each element is obtained by adding the integer value of each element separated by a space in the input to the value of variable `o`. The function reads input from the user and splits it by space, then converts each element to an integer before adding `o` to it.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5, and m is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.**
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n elements, where each element is the result of calling func_2()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts an integer n and a list of n integers m. It then returns a list of n elements, where each element is the result of calling func_2().

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values obtained by applying 'func_5' to the arguments '*dim[1:]' for each element in the range of 'dim[0]'. If 'dim' is empty, the program returns the result of calling function 'f'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 accepts a parameter `f` and returns a list of values obtained by applying 'func_5' to the arguments '*dim[1:]' for each element in the range of 'dim[0]'. If 'dim' is empty, the program returns the result of calling function 'f'. However, there seems to be a missing definition or initialization of the variable `dim` in the code, which could potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
