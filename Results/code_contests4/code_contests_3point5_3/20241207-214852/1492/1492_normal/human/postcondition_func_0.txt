The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from input and then calls `func_2` to get a list `ar`. It initializes various lists and variables based on the input. It then iterates through the elements of `ar`, updating a dynamic programming list `dp` based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the last element of `dp` after the loop ends. The function internally handles the constraints and operations based on the input, but the exact nature of these operations based on the logic inside the loop is not explicitly described in the annotations.
