Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1 for the loop to execute the first time; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in the list; `maxstack` is empty; `maxidx` is empty; `minstack` is empty; `minidx` is empty; for the loop to execute one more time, the next element after `x` in the list should be greater than `x`, and `maxidx` should be updated with the new value of `i` and `maxidx` is removed from the list.**
