According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `maxstack and maxstack[-1] < x`. The loop will execute if `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. Right before the loop, `maxstack` contains the element `x` (since `maxstack` is not empty) and `x` is the second element in the list. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `x` should be less than the next element in the list after the current `x`. Additionally, `maxidx` needs to be updated with the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1 for the loop to execute the first time; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in the list; `maxstack` contains the element `x`; `maxidx` contains the value of `i`; `minstack` is empty; `minidx` is empty; for the loop to execute one more time, the next element after `x` in the list should be greater than `x`, and `maxidx` should be updated with the new value of `i`**
