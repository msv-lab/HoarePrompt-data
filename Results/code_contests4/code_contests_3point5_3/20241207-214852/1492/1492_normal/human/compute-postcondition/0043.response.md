Postcondition: ***n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; first is the first element of the list ar; dp is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1 for the loop to execute the first time; ar is a list with at least 1 element; i is 0; x is the first element in the list; maxstack is empty; maxidx is a non-empty list; minstack is an empty list; minidx is an empty list; after the execution of the if else block, dp[i] is updated to the minimum value between dp[i] and dp[minidx[-1]] + 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. minidx is popped if minstack is not empty and minstack[-1] equals x. Additionally, maxstack is not empty and the last element of maxstack equals x.***
