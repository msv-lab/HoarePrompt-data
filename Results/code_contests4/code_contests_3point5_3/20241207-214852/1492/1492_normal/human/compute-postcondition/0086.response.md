Output State: **n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; first is the first element of the list ar; dp is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; ar is a list with at least 1 element; i is 1; x is the second element in the list; maxstack is empty; maxidx is not empty; minstack is not empty; minidx is empty; maxidx is true; dp[i] is updated based on the formula min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1); minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is equal to x; if (maxstack and maxstack[-1] == x) and we pop an element from maxstack.**
