Example Answer:
The list `maxstack` is assigned with the value of `first`, which is the first element of the list `ar`. The other variables `n` and `dp` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n zeros; `maxstack` is assigned with the value of `first`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n zeros; `maxstack` is assigned with the value of `first`**
