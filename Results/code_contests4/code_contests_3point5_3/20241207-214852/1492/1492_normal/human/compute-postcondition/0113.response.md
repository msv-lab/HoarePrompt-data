According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. If `maxstack` is non-empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5;
first is the first element of the list ar;
dp is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
ar is a list with at least 2 elements;
x is the third element in the list;
maxstack contains x;
maxidx no longer contains the last value;
minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is less than or equal to x;
dp[i] is updated based on the formula min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1);
minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is less than or equal to x;
minidx does not contain the last value of i.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to make sure that `maxstack` is still non-empty and the last element of `maxstack` is still less than `x`.
State: **n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; first is the first element of the list ar; dp is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; ar is a list with at least 2 elements; x is the third element in the list; maxstack contains x; maxidx no longer contains the last value; minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is less than or equal to x; dp[i] is updated based on the formula min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1); minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is less than or equal to x; minidx does not contain the last value of i; for the loop to execute one more time, maxstack should still be non-empty and the last element of maxstack should still be less than x**
