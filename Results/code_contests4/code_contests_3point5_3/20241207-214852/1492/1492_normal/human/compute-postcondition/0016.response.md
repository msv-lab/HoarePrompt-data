According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `minstack and minstack[-1] > x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `minstack` needs to be non-empty and the last element in `minstack` must be greater than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` is empty. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to add an element greater than `x` to `minstack`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; `maxstack` is assigned with the value of `first`; `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0; `minstack` is a list containing a value greater than x; `minidx` is an empty list; for the loop to execute the first time, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, and `i` is equal to 0**
