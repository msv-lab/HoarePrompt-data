According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. If `maxstack` is not empty and the top element is removed from `maxstack`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxstack` is not empty and the top element is removed from `maxstack. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; for the loop to execute the first time, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, and `i` is equal to 0; for the loop to execute again, `maxstack` is not empty and the top element is removed from `maxstack`**
