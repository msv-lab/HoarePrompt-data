Functionality: ** The function func_5 accepts a parameter `f` and returns a list of values obtained by applying 'func_5' to the arguments '*dim[1:]' for each element in the range of 'dim[0]'. If 'dim' is empty, the program returns the result of calling function 'f'. However, there seems to be a missing definition or initialization of the variable `dim` in the code, which could potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior. **
