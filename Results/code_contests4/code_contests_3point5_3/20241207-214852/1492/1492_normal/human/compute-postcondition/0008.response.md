According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ar`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. 
Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n zeros; `maxstack` is assigned with the value of `first`; `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0; `minstack` is a list containing the value of `first`; `minidx` is a list containing the value 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0 and `x` is the first element in the list.**
