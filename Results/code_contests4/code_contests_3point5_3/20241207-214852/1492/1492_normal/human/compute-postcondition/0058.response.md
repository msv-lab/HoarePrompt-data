According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `minstack and minstack[-1] > x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `minstack` must not be empty and the last element in `minstack` must be greater than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` is empty and `minidx` is empty. To adjust the states for the loop to execute again, `minstack` needs to contain elements and the last element in `minstack` must be greater than `x`.
State: **`n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1 for the loop to execute the first time; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in the list; `maxstack` contains the element `x`; `maxidx` contains the value of `i`; `minstack` contains elements and the last element is greater than `x`; `minidx` is empty; `maxidx` is updated with the value of `i`**
