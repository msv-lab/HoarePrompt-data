According to the code, the loop can execute as long as minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is greater than x. Right before the loop, minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is equal to x. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the last element of minstack should be greater than x.
State: **n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; first is the first element of the list ar; dp is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; ar is a list with at least 2 elements; x is the third element in the list; maxstack contains x; maxidx contains the value of i; minstack is not empty and contains x; maxidx contains the value of i; dp[i] is updated based on the formula min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1); minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is greater than x; minidx contains the value of i.**
