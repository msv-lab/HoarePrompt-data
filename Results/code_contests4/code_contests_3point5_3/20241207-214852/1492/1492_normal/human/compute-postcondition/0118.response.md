Output State: **n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; first is the first element of the list ar; dp is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; ar is a list with at least 2 elements; x is the third element in the list; maxstack contains x; maxidx no longer contains the last value; minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is less than or equal to x; dp[i] is updated based on the formula min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1); minstack is not empty and the last element of minstack is less than or equal to x; minidx does not contain the last value of i; the while loop has finished execution; the program has entered the if condition where minidx is true**
