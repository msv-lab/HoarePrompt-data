According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `maxstack and maxstack[-1] < x`. Right before the loop, `maxstack` is assigned with the value of `first`, and `x` is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute the first time, `maxstack` must not be empty and the last element in `maxstack` must be less than `x`. 

Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `maxstack` should not be empty
- The last element in `maxstack` should be less than `x`

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; `maxstack` is assigned with the value of `first`; `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0; `minstack` is an empty list; `minidx` is an empty list; for the loop to execute the first time, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, and `i` is equal to 0**
