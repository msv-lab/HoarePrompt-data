Example Answer: 
The code snippet `debug_print(dp)` will output the list `dp` which was calculated based on the conditions within the loop. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5; `first` is the first element of the list `ar`; `dp` is a list of n integers calculated based on the conditions within the loop; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is n-1; `x` is the last element in the list; `maxstack` and `maxidx` contain the maximum element and its index respectively; `minstack` and `minidx` contain the minimum element and its index respectively.
