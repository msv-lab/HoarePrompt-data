According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `minstack and minstack[-1] > x` is true. At the end of the previous iteration, `minstack` contains elements and the last element is greater than `x`, and `minidx` is empty. For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `minidx` needs to be updated with the value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 3*10^5, `first` is the first element of the list `ar`, `dp` is a list of n integers where dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list, `maxstack` contains the element `x`, `maxidx` contains the value of `i`, `minstack` contains elements and the last element is greater than `x`, `minidx` is updated with the value of `i`, `maxidx` is updated with the value of `i`.**
