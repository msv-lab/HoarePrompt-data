Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the sum of f(S) over all possible ways of choosing K integers from the given list A. The program calculates the answer modulo (10^9+7) as required. It handles the constraints of the problem statement and correctly sorts the input list A before processing. The functions defined in the program are used appropriately to calculate the required values and the main function func_7 reads input, calculates the answer, and prints it. Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all the given examples.
