The function `func_7` reads input integers N and K, and a list of integers A. It then calculates various values using helper functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_6`, and eventually prints the final result `ans`. The function does not explicitly return a value. However, the annotations indicate the postconditions based on the calculations performed, but it is essential to note that the actual functionality may deviate from the annotations due to potential missing logic or edge cases in the code.
