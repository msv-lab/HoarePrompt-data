Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description provided. It calculates the sum of f(S) over all possible ways of choosing K integers from the given list A, where f(X) = max(X) - min(X). The program uses mathematical functions to efficiently calculate the required values and takes the modulus (10^9+7) as required by the problem description. The program iterates through the list of integers, calculates the differences and ways of choosing integers, and updates the final answer accordingly. The program ensures that the calculations stay within the specified constraints and accurately computes the result. Hence, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
