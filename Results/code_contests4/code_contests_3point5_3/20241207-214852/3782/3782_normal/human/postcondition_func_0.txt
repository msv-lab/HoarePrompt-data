The function func_1 accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, calculates the sum of `a` and `b` in variable `c`, and then checks if `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from `c`. The function then returns the value of `c`, which is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `mod`.
