According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to `n + 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a particular value based on the previous iteration and the specific input values provided to `func_3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted based on the output of `func_3` and the specific input values provided.
State: **The output state will depend on the implementation of `func_3` and the specific input values provided**.
