Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. Since there are no other variables affected by the code snippet, the output state is: `fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is 0**
