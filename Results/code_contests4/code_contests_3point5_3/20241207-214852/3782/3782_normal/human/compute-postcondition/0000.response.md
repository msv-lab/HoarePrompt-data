Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input separated by a space. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers, so they will be assigned accordingly. The other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9, n and k are assigned the input values.**
