Example Answer:
The value of `fac[i]` is updated by calling `func_3` with the previous value of `fac[i - 1]` and `i` as arguments. The specific implementation of `func_3` will determine the new value of `fac[i]`. Therefore, the Output State will depend on the implementation of `func_3` and the specific input values provided.
Output State: **Output state will depend on the implementation of `func_3` and the specific input values provided**
