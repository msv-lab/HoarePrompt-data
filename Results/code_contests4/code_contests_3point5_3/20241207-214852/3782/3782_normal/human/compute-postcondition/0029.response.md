Example Answer:
The variable `ways` is updated by applying `func_2` on the current value of `ways` and the result of `func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)`. The previous values of `ways`, `n`, `i`, `k`, and `fac` are given. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `ways` is obtained. 
Output State: **`fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is updated to the result of applying `func_1` on `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)` has been applied, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i]`, `ways` is updated to the new result after applying `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`**
