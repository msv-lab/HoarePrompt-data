Example Answer:
`ways` is assigned the result of calling `func_2` with the arguments `ways` and the result of calling `func_6` with `i + 1`, `k`, and `fac`. The values of `i` and `fac` are known, `k` is unknown, and `ways` is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 1, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, and `ways` is the result of calling `func_2` with unknown arguments.
Output State: **`fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 1, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, and `ways` is the result of calling `func_2` with unknown arguments.**
