According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n + 5`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current value of `i - 5`.
State: **for the loop to execute another time, `i` is `n + 6`**
