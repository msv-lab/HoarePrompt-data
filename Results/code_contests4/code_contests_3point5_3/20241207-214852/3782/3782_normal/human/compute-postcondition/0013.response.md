According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. Additionally, since the loop iterates over `range(n-1)`, `i` will start at 0. 
State: **`fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 1**
