Example Answer:
`diff` is assigned the result of applying `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`. The previous values of `a` and `i` are not provided, so the exact value of `diff` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is updated to the result of applying `func_1` on `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)` has been applied, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, `ways` is updated to the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`, `ways` is updated with the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`, `ways` is updated with the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)), `diff` is assigned the result of applying `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`.
Output State: **`fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is updated to the result of applying `func_1` on `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)` has been applied, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, `ways` is updated to the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`, `ways` is updated with the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`, `ways` is updated with the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)), `diff` is assigned the result of applying `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])**
