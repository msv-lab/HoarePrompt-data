Example Answer:
`fac[i]` is assigned the value returned by `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)`, where `i` is `n + 6`. The output of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` depends on the values of `fac[i - 1]` and `i`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the final Output State is: for the loop to execute another time, `i` is `n + 6`.
Output State: **for the loop to execute another time, `i` is `n + 6`**
