Example Answer:
The value of `fac[i]` is assigned the result of calling `func_3` with arguments `fac[i - 1]` and `i`. The initial value of `fac` is a list of `n + 5` elements initialized to 0. The loop will execute for the first time, so `i` is 1. The output state will be based on the calculations performed in `func_3`.
Output State: **The output state will depend on the implementation of `func_3` and the specific input values provided.**
