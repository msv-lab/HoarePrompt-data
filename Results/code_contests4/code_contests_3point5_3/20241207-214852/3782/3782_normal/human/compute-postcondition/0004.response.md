According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is in the range from 1 to n+5 exclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N, A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9, n and k are assigned the input values, a is a list of integers created by converting the input values, fac is a list of (n + 5) elements initialized to 0, i is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
