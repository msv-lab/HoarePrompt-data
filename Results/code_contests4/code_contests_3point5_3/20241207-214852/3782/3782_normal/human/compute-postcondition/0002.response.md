Example Answer:
`fac` is a list initialized to have (n + 5) elements, all initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are n and the input values assigned to n. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N, A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9, n and k are assigned the input values, a is a list of integers created by converting the input values, fac is a list of (n + 5) elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N, A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9, n and k are assigned the input values, a is a list of integers created by converting the input values, fac is a list of (n + 5) elements initialized to 0**
