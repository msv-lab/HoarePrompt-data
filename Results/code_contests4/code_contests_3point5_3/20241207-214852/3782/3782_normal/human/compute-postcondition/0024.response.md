Output State: **`fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is updated to the result of applying `func_1` on `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)` has been applied, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, `ways` is updated to the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`, `ways` is updated with the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`, `ways` is updated with the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`**
