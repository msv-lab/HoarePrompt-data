Output State: **`fac` contains the result of applying `func_3` iteratively on `fac[0]` to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted, `ans` is the final result after applying `func_1` iteratively on the results of `func_3(diff, ways)` for all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])` for the last iteration, `ways` is the final result after applying all `func_2` and `func_6` functions iteratively for all iterations of the loop**
