Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the given graph. The program reads the input, constructs the graph, and then applies the union-find algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. The logic for finding the minimum spanning tree and calculating its weight seems to be correct based on the problem description. The program handles all vertices and edges as required by the problem statement. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, it appears that the program is correct for all potential cases.
