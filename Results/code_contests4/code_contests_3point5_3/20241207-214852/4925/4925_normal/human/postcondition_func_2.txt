Functionality: The function `union` takes two parameters `u` and `v` and ensures that they are connected in a union-find data structure. It finds the root of each parameter and compares their ranks. If the ranks are equal, one of the roots becomes the parent of the other, and the rank of the new parent increases by 1. If the ranks are not equal, the root with the lower rank becomes the child of the other root. The function does not return anything explicitly, but it modifies the parent array `p` and rank array `r` accordingly to perform the union operation. The precondition specifies the valid ranges for `u` and `v`, ensuring that they are within acceptable bounds.
