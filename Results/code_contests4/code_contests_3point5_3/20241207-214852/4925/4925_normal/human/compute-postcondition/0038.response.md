Example Answer: 
The function `union(i, j)` is called, which is expected to union the sets `sg[i]` and `sg[j]`. Since all sets in `sg` are empty and `i` is not in `sg[j]`, after the execution of the function, `i` will be added to `sg[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: All sets in `sg` are empty, `i` is 1, `i` is in `sg[j], `n` is greater than 0, `j` is not in `sg[i].
Output State: **All sets in `sg` are empty, `i` is 1, `i` is in `sg[j], `n` is greater than 0, `j` is not in `sg[i]**
