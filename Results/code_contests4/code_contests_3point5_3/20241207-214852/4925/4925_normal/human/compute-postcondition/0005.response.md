Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped, and `x` is assigned the value of `x % y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. After execution, the new values of `x` and `y` will be updated accordingly based on the initial values.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on the initial non-negative integer values**
