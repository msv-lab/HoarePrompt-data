Example Answer:
The `find(i)` function is called and the result is added to the set `roots`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All sets in `sg` are fully populated with elements from 0 to n-1, index `v` of the set in `sg` with the minimum length can be any index, `roots` contains the result of `find(i)`.
Output State: **All sets in `sg` are fully populated with elements from 0 to n-1, index `v` of the set in `sg` with the minimum length can be any index, `roots` contains the result of `find(i)`**
