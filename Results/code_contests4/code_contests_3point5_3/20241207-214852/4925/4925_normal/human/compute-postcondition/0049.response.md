Output State: **All sets in `sg` are modified based on the conditions for the next iteration. `i` is either increased by 1 and added to the set at index `v` in `sg` if it is not already present in `sg[v]`, or set to 1 and all elements `i` and `j` up to `n-1` are united in `sg[i] for the next iteration to occur**
