Example Answer:
`p[vc]` is assigned the value of `v`, and `vc` is assigned the value of `p[vc]`, which is equal to `p[v]`. Since `vc` needs to be set to a value different from `v`, `vc` will not be equal to `p[v]`. Therefore, after execution, `p[vc]` is equal to `v`, and `vc` is equal to `v`. The output state is: `vc` is equal to `v`, `v` is equal to `p[v]`, and `p[vc]` is equal to `p[v]`.
Output State: **`vc` is equal to `v`, `v` is equal to `p[v]`, `p[vc]` is equal to `p[v]`**
