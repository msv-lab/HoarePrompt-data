According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all sets in `sg` are empty, `v` is the index of a non-empty set in `sg`, `i`, `j+1` and all elements in set `sg[v]` are now combined after the union operation `union(i, j)`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **All sets in `sg` are empty, `v` is the index of a non-empty set in `sg`, `i`, `j+2` and all elements in set `sg[v]` are now combined after the union operation `union(i, j+1)`**
