Example Answer:
The function `union(i, j)` is called, which means the sets in `sg` are modified based on the conditions for the next iteration. If `i` is not already present in `sg[v]`, it is increased by 1 and added to the set at index `v` in `sg`. If `i` is present in `sg[v]`, then `i` is set to 1 and all elements `i` and `j` up to `n-1` are united in `sg[i] for the next iteration to occur. The element `j` is not present in set `sg[i]`. Since the specific values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `sg` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact state of the variables after running this code.
Output State: **The state of the variables cannot be determined without specific values.**
