Example Answer:
The value of `r` is used as the divisor in the ceiling function for `x / r`. The output of the ceiling function is an integer value, which is then assigned to `"""`. Since the previous values of `x` and `r` are unknown, the output state is: x and r are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5), and the result of the ceiling function is assigned to """.
Output State: **x and r are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5), and the result of the ceiling function is assigned to """**
