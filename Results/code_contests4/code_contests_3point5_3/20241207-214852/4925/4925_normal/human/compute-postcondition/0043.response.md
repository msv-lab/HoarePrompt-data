According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all sets in `sg` are empty, `i` is 1, `i` is in `sg[j]` for the loop to execute the second time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is not in `sg[1], `i` and `j` are now united. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` remains 1.
- `n` should remain greater than 0.
- `i` should be removed from `sg[j]` if it was previously there.
- `j` should be united with `i`.

State: **All sets in `sg` are empty, `i` is 1, `j` is united with `i`, for the loop to execute the third time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is not in `sg[1] and `i` is not in `sg[j]`**
