According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all sets in `sg` are empty, `v` is the index of a non-empty set in `sg`, `i` and `j` are present in set `sg[v]`, `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **All sets in `sg` are empty, `v` is the index of a non-empty set in `sg`, `i` and `j+1` are present in set `sg[v]`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0**
