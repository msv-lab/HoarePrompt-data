Postcondition: ***All sets in `sg` are modified based on the conditions for the next iteration. If `i` is not in `sg[v]`, then `i` is increased by 1 and added to the set at index `v` in `sg`. If `i` is already present in `sg[v]`, `i` is set to 1 and all elements `i` and `j` up to `n-1` are united in `sg[i] for the next iteration to occur. If `j` is not in `sg[i]`, then `i` is either increased by 1 and added to the set at index `v` in `sg` if it is not already present, or set to 1 and all elements `i` and `j` up to `n-1` are united in `sg[i] for the next iteration to occur. The loop will only execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0.***
