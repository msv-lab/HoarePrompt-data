The function `union` accepts two parameters `u` and `v`. **Precondition**: `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 <= `u`, `v` <= 10^5. The input edges are represented as pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and `u`, inclusive, and the two integers are not equal to each other. The function returns the value of variable `u` which is equal to variable `v`.
