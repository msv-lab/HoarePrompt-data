According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` should be non-zero. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, for the loop to execute again `y` should be non-zero**
