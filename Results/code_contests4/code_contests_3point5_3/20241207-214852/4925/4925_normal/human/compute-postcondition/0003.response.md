Functionality: **The function `func_11` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, both integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5). The function calculates the result of the expression (x + r - 1) divided by r, rounded up to the nearest integer and returns that result.**
