Example Answer:
The `union(i, j)` function performs the union operation on sets `sg[i]` and `sg[j]`. Since `i` is present in set `sg[v]` and `j` is not present in set `sg[i]`, after the union operation, set `sg[i]` will contain both elements `i` and `j`. All other sets and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All sets in `sg` are empty, `v` is the index of a non-empty set in `sg`, `i` and `j` are present in set `sg[v]`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **All sets in `sg` are empty, `v` is the index of a non-empty set in `sg`, `i` and `j` are present in set `sg[v]`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
