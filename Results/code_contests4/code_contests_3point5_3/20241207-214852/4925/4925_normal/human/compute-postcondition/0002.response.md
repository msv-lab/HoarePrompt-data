The function `func_11` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5). After executing the function body, the program returns the result of the expression (x + r - 1) divided by r, rounded up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_11` is to accept two integers `x` and `r` within the specified constraints and return the result of the expression (x + r - 1) divided by r, rounded up to the nearest integer.
