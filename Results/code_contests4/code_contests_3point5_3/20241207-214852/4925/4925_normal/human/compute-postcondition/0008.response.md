The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ y ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5). After executing the function body, the program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, which is x. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two non-negative integers x and y within the specified constraints and return the greatest common divisor of the initial value of x.
