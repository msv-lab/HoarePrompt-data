Postcondition: ***All sets in `sg` are modified based on the conditions. If `j` is not in `sg[i]`, then `i` is either increased by 1 and added to the set at index `v` in `sg` if it is not already present, or set to 1 and all elements `i` and `j` up to `n-1` are united for the next iteration to occur. `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.***
