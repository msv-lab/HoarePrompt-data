Example Answer:
The value returned by `find(i)` is added to the set `roots`. The set `roots` now includes the result of `find(i)` along with its previous elements. The sets in `sg` remain fully populated with elements from 0 to n-1. The index `v` of the set in `sg` with the minimum length can be any index. 
Output State: **All sets in `sg` are fully populated with elements from 0 to n-1, index `v` of the set in `sg` with the minimum length can be any index, `roots` contains the result of `find(i+1)`**
