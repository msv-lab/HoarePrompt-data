You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= m <= min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).
- a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and a_i ≠ b_i.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are integers, `p` is a list containing numbers from 0 to n-1, `sg` is a dictionary where each key is a number from 0 to n-1 and the corresponding value is a set containing numbers that have been added to `sg[key]` during the loop execution.
    v = min(range(n), key=lambda i: len(sg[i]))

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All sets in `sg` are fully populated with elements from 0 to n-1. Each set contains all the numbers from 0 to n-1. The index `v` of the set in `sg` with the minimum length will be any index since all sets have the same length.

        roots.add(find(i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All sets in `sg` are fully populated with elements from 0 to n-1, index `v` of the set in `sg` with the minimum length can be any index, `roots` contains the result of `find(n-1)`
    print(len(roots) - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` initializes variables based on the return values of other functions and then populates sets in a dictionary. It then finds the set with the minimum length, performs union operations based on the elements in the sets, and finally calculates the number of unique roots. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). Each pair of integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) represents the endpoints of an edge of weight 1 in the graph.**
def find(v):
    vc = v
    while v != p[v]:
        v = p[v]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `vc` is assigned the same value as `v`, `v` is equal to `p[v]`
    while vc != v:

    return v
    #The program returns the value of variable `v`, which is equal to `p[v]` and `p[vc]` is equal to `p[v`]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find` accepts a parameter `v` representing a vertex in a graph. It iterates through the parent array `p` to find the root node using path compression technique. The function then returns the root node of the input vertex `v`. The code does not cover edge cases where `p` is not properly initialized or where `v` is out of bounds.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= m <= min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). The input edges are represented as pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive, and the two integers are not equal to each other.**
def union(u, v):
    u, v = find(u), find(v)
    if (u == v) :
        return
        #The program returns the value of variable `u` which is equal to variable `v`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *u and v are not equal
    if (r[u] < r[v]) :
        u, v = v, u
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *u and v are not equal. If r[u] < r[v], u and v have swapped values while r[u] and r[v] remain integers.
    p[u] = v
    if (r[u] == r[v]) :
        r[u] += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`u` and `v` are integers and `u` is not equal to `v`. If `r[u]` is equal to `r[v]`, then `u` and `v` have swapped values while `r[u]` and `r[v]` remain integers with `r[u]` being one more than `r[v]`. Additionally, `p[u]` is `v`.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `union` takes two parameters `u` and `v` and ensures that they are connected in a union-find data structure. It finds the root of each parameter and compares their ranks. If the ranks are equal, one of the roots becomes the parent of the other, and the rank of the new parent increases by 1. If the ranks are not equal, the root with the lower rank becomes the child of the other root. The function does not return anything explicitly, but it modifies the parent array `p` and rank array `r` accordingly to perform the union operation. The precondition specifies the valid ranges for `u` and `v`, ensuring that they are within acceptable bounds.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer greater than or equal to 0.**
def func_2(x):

    #The program returns the result of calculating x raised to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter x, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and calculates x raised to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD.

def func_3(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x and y are non-negative integers satisfying the given constraints, with x being the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, and y being 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, which is x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two non-negative integers x and y where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ y ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5). It calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the result as x.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= m <= min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).**
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers by mapping the input values after splitting them.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It reads input values, splits them, maps them to integers, and returns a list of integers. The function does not handle any edge cases or validate the input.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= m <= min((n*(n-1))/2, 10^5). a_i and b_i are integers representing the endpoints of each edge with 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and a_i != b_i.**
def func_5(o):
    return list(map(lambda x: int(x) + o, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list where each element is the integer value of the input split by spaces plus the value of variable 'o'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 accepts a parameter 'o' and returns a list where each element is the integer value of the input split by spaces plus the value of variable 'o'. The function reads input from the console, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, adds 'o' to each element, and returns the resulting list. The function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from invalid input or missing values.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= m <= min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).**
def func_6(n, m):
    return [func_4() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of results from calling func_4() n times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m` where 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= m <= min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). It then returns a list containing the results of calling `func_4()` n times.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(f):
    return [func_7(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values obtained by calling function `func_7` with arguments `f` and unpacked `dim[1:]` for each value in the range of `dim[0]` if `dim` is not empty. Otherwise, it returns the result of calling function `f`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `f` and a list `dim`. If `dim` is not empty, the function returns a list of values obtained by calling function `func_7` with arguments `f` and unpacked `dim[1:]` for each value in the range of `dim[0]`. If `dim` is empty, the function simply returns the result of calling function `f`.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i.**
def func_8(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' with a step size of 'step' and containing 'count' elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `start`, `step`, and `count`, all of which are integers. The function returns a range starting from the `start` value with a step size of `step` and containing `count` elements. The code accurately implements this functionality without missing logic or edge cases.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i.**
def func_9(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range starting from index 'start' up to the length of list 'l' plus 'end'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list `l`, and two integers `start` and `end`. It then returns a range starting from index `start` up to the length of list `l` plus `end`. The function ensures that `start` and `end` fall within the valid range for indexing the list `l`.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple of two integers where the first integer represents the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and the second integer represents the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)).**
def func_10(n):
    """ [0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ...] """
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the number of vertices in the graph
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_10 accepts a tuple of two integers representing the vertices and edges in a graph. It then calculates and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the number of vertices in the graph. The function uses a bitwise operation to find the nearest power of 2.

    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the result of the expression (x + r - 1) divided by r, rounded up to the nearest integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, both integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5). The function calculates the result of the expression (x + r - 1) divided by r, rounded up to the nearest integer and returns that result.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
