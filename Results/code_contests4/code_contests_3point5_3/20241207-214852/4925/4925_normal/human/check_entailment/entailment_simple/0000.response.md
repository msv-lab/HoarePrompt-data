Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the algorithm to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the given graph. The program reads the input, constructs the graph, and then uses the union-find algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. Finally, it calculates and prints the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

The program follows the problem description by ensuring that it handles the input constraints, constructs the graph with the given edges, and finds the minimum spanning tree correctly. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
