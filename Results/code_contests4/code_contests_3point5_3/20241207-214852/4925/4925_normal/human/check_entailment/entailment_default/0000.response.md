Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a complete graph where some edges have weight 1 and the rest have weight 0.
- The code uses union-find data structure to keep track of the connected components and efficiently determine the minimum spanning tree.
- The code handles the input correctly by reading the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges with weight 1 `m`, and the endpoints of each edge.
- The code calculates the weight of the minimum spanning tree by finding unique roots after performing union operations on the connected components.
- The code does not miss any logic or edge cases in the implementation, and it correctly calculates the weight of the minimum spanning tree based on the given problem description.
- The output hints also agree with the code and do not introduce any contradictory cases, further confirming the correctness of the program.
