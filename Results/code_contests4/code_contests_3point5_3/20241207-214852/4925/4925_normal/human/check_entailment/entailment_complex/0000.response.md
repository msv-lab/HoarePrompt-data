Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the weight of the minimum spanning tree of a complete graph with some edges having weight 1. However, the code does not consider the complete graph aspect, where each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The code only focuses on the edges with weight 1, which may not cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem.

An example of a potential case where the code may not work correctly:
Input:
3 1
1 2

Output:
1

In this case, the code may not handle the scenario where the complete graph has multiple edges with weight 0 and only one edge with weight 1. The code may not accurately calculate the weight of the minimum spanning tree in such cases.
