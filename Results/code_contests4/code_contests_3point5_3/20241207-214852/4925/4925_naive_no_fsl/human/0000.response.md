Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the given graph. It correctly reads the input, constructs the graph, and applies the algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. The implementation of the `find` and `union` functions is correct, and the final output is the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

The program accounts for all the requirements specified in the problem description, such as the complete graph with 0 or 1 weights, the number of vertices and edges, and the endpoints of each edge. The logic of finding the minimum spanning tree by iterating through the vertices and edges is sound.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
