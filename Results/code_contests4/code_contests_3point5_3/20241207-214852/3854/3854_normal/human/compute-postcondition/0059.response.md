Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j`, `d` remain positive integers and lists as described. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `cell[d]` is updated to `True`, `nn[d]` is updated to `j`, and `core` is updated accordingly. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to `j` based on the conditions mentioned.***
