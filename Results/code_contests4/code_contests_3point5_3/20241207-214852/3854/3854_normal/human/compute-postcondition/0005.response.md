According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `n`. Before the loop starts, all the variables are initialized but the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` zeros, `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`, `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros, `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
