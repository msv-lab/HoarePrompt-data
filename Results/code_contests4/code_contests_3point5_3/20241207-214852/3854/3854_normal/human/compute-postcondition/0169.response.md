According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of i from 1 to n (inclusive). Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`core` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `cell` modified according to the if-else statements, `nn` updated based on the logic in the loop, `d` assigned new values as per the conditions, `i` is 1, `m` will maintain its initial positive integer value, `j` is n+1, `n` will maintain its initial positive integer value, `k` is at least 1**.
