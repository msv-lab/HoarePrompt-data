Postcondition: ***All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described. `j` is 3. If `nn[d]` is not 0, the program updates `core[j]` to `i + 1`, sets `d` to the value of `ins[j][i]`, updates `nn[d]` to `j` if `cell[d]` is True. If `nn[d]` is 0, the program updates `d` to the value of `ins[j][i]`, updates `nn[ins[j][i]]` to `j`, ensures `nn[d]` is 0, and assigns `d` the value of `ins[j][i]`. After the execution of the if-else block, the specified conditions are maintained without any changes.***
