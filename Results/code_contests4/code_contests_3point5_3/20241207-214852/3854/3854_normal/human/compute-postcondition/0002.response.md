Example Answer:
A list `cell` is created with `k + 1` elements, each initialized to `False`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned input integer values, and `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing `m` zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned input integer values; `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned input integer values; `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`**
