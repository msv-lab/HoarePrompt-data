Postcondition: ***`d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, the `cell` list does not have a True value at the index `d`. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, the values of `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are updated to `i + 1`. If `nn[d]` was originally 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
