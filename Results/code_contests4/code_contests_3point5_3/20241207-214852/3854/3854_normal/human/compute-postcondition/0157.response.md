Example Answer:
`core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is the current value of `i`. The loop condition remains the same as the assignment to `j` is not mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1`, and the loop condition `j <= n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1, `j <= n`**
