Postcondition: ***All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `core[j]` is equal to 0, `d` is not equal to 0, and the condition `(cell[d])` is false. Additionally, the value of `nn[d]` is equal to 1. The condition `(nn[d] == 0)` is false.***
