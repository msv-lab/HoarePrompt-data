According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` zeros, `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`, `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros, `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` zeros, `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`, `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros, `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1**
