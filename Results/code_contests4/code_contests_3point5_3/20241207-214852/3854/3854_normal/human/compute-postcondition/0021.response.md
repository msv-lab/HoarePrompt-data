Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than 0. `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers. `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`. `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros. `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. `i` is 0 to `m-1`, `j` is 1. When the if condition `(core[j] == 0)` is met, the value of `core` at index `j` is 0.***
