Postcondition: ***Output State: `core` updated, `cell` modified, `nn` modified with all elements set to 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `m` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `core[j]` is 0. Additionally, `d` is not equal to 0.***
