Example Answer:
`cell[d]` is set to True, where `d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`. The variables `core`, `nn`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `n` are not affected directly. However, the value of `j` needs to be incremented for the loop to execute another time. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is True, `j` needs to be incremented to continue the loop.
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is True, `j` needs to be incremented to continue the loop**
