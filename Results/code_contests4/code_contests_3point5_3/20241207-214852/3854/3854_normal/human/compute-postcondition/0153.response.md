Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `core`, `cell`, `nn`, `d`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `n` are all updated and modified according to the conditions met. Specifically, when `d` is not equal to 0, various assignments and updates are made to `core`, `cell`, `nn`, `d`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `n` based on different conditions. When `cell[d]` is true, `core` is updated, `cell` is modified, `nn` is updated, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `i` is increased, `m` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is at least 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `core[j]` is updated accordingly, `cell[d]` status changes to false, `d` is not equal to 0, and specific assignments and updates are made to `nn` based on the conditions met in the if else block. When `cell[d]` is false, `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `core` is updated, `cell` is modified, `nn` is updated, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `i` is increased, `m` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. When `nn[d]` is equal to 0, `core` is updated, `cell` is modified, `nn` is updated, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `i` is increased, `m` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `core[j]` is updated accordingly, the status of `cell[d]` changes to false, `d` is not equal to 0, and specific assignments and updates are made to `nn` based on the conditions met in the if else block.***
