Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers. `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`. `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros. `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. `i` is an integer from 0 to `m-1`. `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `d` is assigned the value at index `i` of the sublist at index 2 of `ins`. After executing the code, `nn[d]` is assigned the value `j`.**
