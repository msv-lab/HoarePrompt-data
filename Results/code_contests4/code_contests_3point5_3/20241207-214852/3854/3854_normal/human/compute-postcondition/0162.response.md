Postcondition: ***`d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`. All variables `core`, `cell`, `nn`, `d`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `n` are updated and modified. For the loop to execute another time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `d` is assigned to `ins[j][i]`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. All other variables retain their updated and modified values.***
