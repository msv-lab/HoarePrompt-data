Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, where `ins` is a 2D list, `j` is 2, and `i` maintains a positive integer value. The value of `d` will be based on the elements of `ins` at index `j` and `i`. 
Output State: **All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j`, `d` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `core[j]` and `d` must meet the conditions described above, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`**
