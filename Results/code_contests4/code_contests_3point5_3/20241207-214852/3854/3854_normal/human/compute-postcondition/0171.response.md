According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `core` at index `i` is printed. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be within the range of 1 to `n+1`.
State: **The value of `core` at index `i+1` is printed, where `i` is incremented by 1**
