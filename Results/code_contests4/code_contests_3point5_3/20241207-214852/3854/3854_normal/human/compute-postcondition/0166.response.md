Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `core`, `cell`, `nn`, `d`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `n` are all updated and modified. For the loop to execute another time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. If `core[j]` is equal to 0, then `d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`. If `d` is not equal to 0, the following actions take place: If `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1`, and `j` is incremented. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, `j` is incremented, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value `i + 1`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `nn[d]` is 0, `d` is assigned to `ins[j][i]`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
