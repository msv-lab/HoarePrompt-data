Postcondition: ***All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described. `j` is 3. If `core[j]` is equal to 0 and `d` is not equal to 0, the program updates `core[j]` to `i + 1`, sets `d` to the value of `ins[j][i]`, updates `nn[d]` to `j` if `cell[d]` is True. If `core[j]` is equal to 0 and `d` is equal to 0, the program updates `d` to the value of `ins[j][i]`, updates `nn[ins[j][i]]` to `j`, and ensures `nn[d]` is 0. `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. After the execution of the if block, the specified conditions are maintained without any changes.***
