Postcondition: ***All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described. `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `core[j]` is equal to `i + 1`, `d` is not equal to 0. If `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1` and `nn[d]` is set to 0. If `cell[d]` is false, then `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1`, `nn[d]` is set to 1, and the loop continues.***
