Example Answer:
`core` is assigned a list of `n + 1` zeros. Since `n` is an input integer, the length of `core` will be `n + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned input integer values; `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`; `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros; `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned input integer values; `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`; `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros; `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
