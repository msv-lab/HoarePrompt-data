Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it, and `map(int, ...)` converts the inputs to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now determined based on the input values. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the input integer values**
