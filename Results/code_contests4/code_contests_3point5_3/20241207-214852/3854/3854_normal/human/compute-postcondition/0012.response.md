According to the code, the loop will execute `m` times. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
- `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `m-1`
- State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers input by the user, `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`, `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros, `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 0 to `m-1` for the loop to execute**
