According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 1`, `nn[j]` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`, so `j` should be `k` and `nn[j]` should be 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers input by the user, `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`, `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros, `nn[j]` is 0, `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 0 to `m-1`, for the loop to execute the third time `j` is `k, `nn[j]` is 0**
