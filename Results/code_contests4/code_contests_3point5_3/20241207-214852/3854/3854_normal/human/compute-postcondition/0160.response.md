Example Answer:
`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. The values of `d`, `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]`, `j`, `core[j]`, and `core[nn[d]]` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is True, `j` is incremented, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value `i + 1`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is True, `j` is incremented, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value `i + 1`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`**
