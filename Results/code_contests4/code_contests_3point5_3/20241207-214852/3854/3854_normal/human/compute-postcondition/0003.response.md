Example Answer:
`nn` is initialized as a list of `k + 1` zeros. The previous values of `nn` are unknown, but after execution, `nn` will contain `k + 1` zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned input integer values; `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`; `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned input integer values; `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`; `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros**
