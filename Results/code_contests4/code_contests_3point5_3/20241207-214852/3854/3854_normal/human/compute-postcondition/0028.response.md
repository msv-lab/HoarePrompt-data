Example Answer:
After executing the code, the value of `cell` at index `d` is set to True. Given that `d` is not equal to 0, and there was no True value at index `d` in the `cell` list initially, the `cell` list now has a True value at index `d`. The values of `d` and the `nn` list remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0. There is a True value at index `d` in the `cell` list. The value at index `d` in the `nn` list is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0. There is a True value at index `d` in the `cell` list. The value at index `d` in the `nn` list is not equal to 0.**
