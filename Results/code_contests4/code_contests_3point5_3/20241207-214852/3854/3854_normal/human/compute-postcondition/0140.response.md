Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the output state will have `core` updated, `cell` modified, `nn` modified, `d` assigned a new value, `i` increased, `m` greater than the new value of `i`, `j` equal to 1, `k` at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` greater than or equal to 1, `core[j]` updated accordingly, `cell[d]` status changes, `cell[d]` is false, `d` is not equal to 0, and specific assignments and updates are made to `nn` based on the conditions met in the if else block.***
