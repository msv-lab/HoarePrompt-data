According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. Since the loop is iterating over `j` from 1 to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers. `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`. `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros. `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. `i` is an integer from 0 to `m-1`. `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time.**
