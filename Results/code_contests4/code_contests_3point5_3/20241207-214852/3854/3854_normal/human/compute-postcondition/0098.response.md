Postcondition: ***All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `core[j]` and `d` must meet the conditions described above, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `nn[ins[j][i]]` is assigned the value of `j`, and the condition `nn[d] == 0` is satisfied.***
