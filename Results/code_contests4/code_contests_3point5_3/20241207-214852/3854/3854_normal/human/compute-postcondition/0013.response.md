According to the code, the loop will execute `k` times starting from 1 to `k`. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers input by the user, `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`, `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros, `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 0 to `m-1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
