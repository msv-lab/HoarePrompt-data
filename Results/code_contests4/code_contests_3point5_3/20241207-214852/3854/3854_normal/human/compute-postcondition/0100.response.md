Postcondition: ***All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j`, `d` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described. `j` is 2. If the condition `cell[d]` is True, then `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, and `nn[d]` is updated to `j`. If the condition `cell[d]` is False, then `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `nn[ins[j][i]]` is updated to `j`, and the condition `nn[d] == 0` is satisfied.***
