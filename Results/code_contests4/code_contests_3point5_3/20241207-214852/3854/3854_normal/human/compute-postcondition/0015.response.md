According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers input by the user, `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`, `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros, `nn[j]` is 0, `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 0 to `m-1`, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is `k + 1**.
