Postcondition: ***`d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `d` is not equal to 0, then based on the conditions mentioned, the state of the program variables will be updated. If `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `cell[d]` is False and `nn[d]` is not 0, then `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are updated to `i + 1`. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
