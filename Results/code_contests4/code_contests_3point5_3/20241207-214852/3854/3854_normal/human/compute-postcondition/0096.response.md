Output State: **All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j`, `d` maintain their positive integer values and relationships, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `core[j]` and `d` must meet the conditions described above, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i], `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is now equal to `i + 1`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
