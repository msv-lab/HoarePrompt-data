According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `core` at index `i+1` is printed, where `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be further incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **The value of `core` at index `i+2` is printed, where `i` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than or equal to `n+2`**
