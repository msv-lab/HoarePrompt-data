Postcondition: ***`core`, `cell`, `nn`, `d`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `n` are all updated and modified according to the conditions met in the if else block. Specifically, when `nn[d]` is equal to 0, `core` is updated, `cell` is modified, `nn` is updated with `nn[d]` assigned the value of `j`, `d` assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `i` is increased, `m` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `core[j]` is updated accordingly, the status of `cell[d]` changes to false, `d` is not equal to 0, and specific assignments and updates are made to `nn` based on the conditions met in the if else block.***
