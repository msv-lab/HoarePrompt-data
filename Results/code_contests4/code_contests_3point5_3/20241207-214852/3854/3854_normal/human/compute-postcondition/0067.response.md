According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is increased by 1, and the value of `nn[j]` is set to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be less than `k` after incrementing by 1, and `nn[j+1]` should be set to 0.
State: **All variables and lists `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `d` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described, `k` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `nn[j+1]` is set to 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
