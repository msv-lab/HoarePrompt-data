Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `core` is updated, `cell` is modified, `nn` is modified, `d` is assigned a new value, `i` is increased, `m` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `core[j]` is updated accordingly, `cell[d]` status changes, `(cell[d])` is false, `d` is not equal to 0, and specific assignments and updates are made to `nn` based on the conditions met in the if else block***
