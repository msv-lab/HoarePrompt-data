Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j`, `d` remain positive integers. `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers. `cell` is a list of `True` or `False` values with length `k + 1` where `cell[d]` is set to `True`. `nn` is a list of `k + 1` integers where the value at index `d` is updated to `j`. `core` is updated based on the condition mentioned. `i` is an integer from 0 to `m-1`. `j` is 3 for the loop execution. `d` is assigned the value based on the condition mentioned.**
