Postcondition: ***All values in the list `nn` are set to 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `core`, `i`, `j` maintain their positive integer values and relationships as described. `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `core[j]` is equal to `i + 1`, `d` is not equal to 0. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to `j` and the condition `(cell[d])` is true. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to 1 and the condition `(cell[d])` is false. The overall state of the program after the if else block is the updated values of the variables and lists as described according to the conditions met.***
