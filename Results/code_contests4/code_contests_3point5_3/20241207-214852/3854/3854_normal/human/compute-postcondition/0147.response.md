Output State: **`core` updated, `cell` modified, `nn` modified, `d` assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `i` increased, `m` greater than the new value of `i`, `j` increased by 1, `k` at least 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n` greater than or equal to 2, `core[j]` updated accordingly, `cell[d]` status changes to true, `d` is not equal to 0, and specific assignments and updates are made to `nn` based on the conditions met in the if else block, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1**
