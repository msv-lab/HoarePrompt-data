Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `ins` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements each containing `m` integers. `cell` is a list of `False` values with length `k + 1`. `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros. `core` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. `i` is an integer from 0 to `m-1`. `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. After the execution of the if else block, the state of the program variables will be updated based on the conditions mentioned. If `core[j]` is 0, `d` will be assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `d` is not equal to 0, the program variables will be updated accordingly. If `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` will be assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `cell[d]` is False and `nn[d]` is not 0, then `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` will be updated to `i + 1`. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` will be assigned the value of `j`.***
