Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, creates lists `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` based on the user input. It then iterates through the lists to update the values of `core`, `cell`, `nn`, and `d` according to certain conditions. Finally, it prints the values of `core` at each index from 1 to `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
