Postcondition: ***All variables and lists `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j`, `d` remain positive as described. In the if part, `core[j]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. In the else part, if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `cell[d]` is updated to `True`, `nn[d]` is updated to `j`, and `core` is updated accordingly. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to `j` based on the conditions mentioned.***
