Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `core` at index `i`, but the initial state of `core` and `i` is unknown. After incrementing `i` by 1, the code will print the value of `core` at the updated index. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `core` at index `i+1` is printed, where `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **The value of `core` at index `i+1` is printed, where `i` is incremented by 1**
