Correctness: **True**

The program correctly simulates the processor for a given set of instructions for each core within m cycles. It correctly handles the scenario where multiple cores try to write information into a single cell, leading to a deadlock situation. The program ensures that when a core tries to write information into a locked cell, it is immediately locked as well. The final output accurately indicates the cycle during which each core will be locked, as specified in the problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for different test cases.
