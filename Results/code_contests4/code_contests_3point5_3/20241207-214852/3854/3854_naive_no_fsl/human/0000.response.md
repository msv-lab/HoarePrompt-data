Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program correctly simulates the processor according to the problem description. It handles the deadlock situation where multiple cores try to write information to the same memory cell in a cycle and locks the cores and the corresponding memory cell. The program iterates through the instructions for each core and correctly determines the cycle when a core will be locked. The output is also in the correct format as specified in the problem description. Overall, the program seems to be correctly implemented and follows the problem requirements.
