Functionality: The function `get_adj` takes two integer parameters `i` and `j`. It creates a list of adjacent cell coordinates based on the values of `i` and `j`. Then, it iterates through these coordinates and checks if they are within the grid boundaries and if the corresponding element in the grid is equal to '#'. The function returns a list of valid adjacent cell coordinates that meet the specified conditions. The functionality is to determine and return all neighboring cell coordinates that are within the grid boundaries and have the element '#' in the grid.
