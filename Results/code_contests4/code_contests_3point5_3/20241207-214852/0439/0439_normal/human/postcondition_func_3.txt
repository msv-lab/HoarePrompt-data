The function `func_2` reads user input to create a grid of characters. It checks the grid for specific patterns and calls other functions based on those patterns. If the grid consists of all '.' characters, it returns a list of strings with 'n' elements filled with '.' characters. If certain conditions are met within the grid, it calls `func_3` with a specific parameter. The function does not explicitly return values in most cases but performs operations based on the grid's content and structure.
