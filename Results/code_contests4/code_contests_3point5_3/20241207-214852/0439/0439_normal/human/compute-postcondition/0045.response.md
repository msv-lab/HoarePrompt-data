According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of the function `get_adj(si, sj)`. If the function returns a non-empty list of tuples, the loop will execute. The values `si` and `sj` must be valid indices for the grid. Since `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 1000, and the grid contains only "#" and ".", the loop will execute if the function returns a non-empty list of valid adjacent indices. 
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `get_adj(si, sj)` returns a non-empty list of valid adjacent indices**
