The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to work with a grid consisting of n rows and m columns, where each cell is either "#" (black) or "." (white). The function is responsible for a specific functionality, but since there are no parameters specified in the function definition, it is unclear what the exact output or return value of the function should be.
