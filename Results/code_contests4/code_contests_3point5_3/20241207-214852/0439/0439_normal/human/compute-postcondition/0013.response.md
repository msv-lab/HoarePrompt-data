According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `args`. If there are more elements in the `args`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements in `args`**
