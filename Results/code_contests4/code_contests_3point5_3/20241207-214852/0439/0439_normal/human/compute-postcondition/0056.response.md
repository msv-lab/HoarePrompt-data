Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1. If `visited[si][sj]` is True, then the stack has one less element. If it is False, tuples `(ai, aj)` representing unvisited positions are added to the `stack` for further processing if available in the grid. Otherwise, no changes are made to the grid or the stack.***
