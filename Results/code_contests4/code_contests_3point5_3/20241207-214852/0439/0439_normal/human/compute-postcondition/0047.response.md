Example Answer:
`stack` is appended with the tuple `(ai, aj)`. The values of `ai` and `aj` are added to the `stack`. The `stack` is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. Therefore, after execution, the values of `ai` and `aj` are added to the `stack`.
Output State: **Values of `ai` and `aj` are added to the `stack`**
