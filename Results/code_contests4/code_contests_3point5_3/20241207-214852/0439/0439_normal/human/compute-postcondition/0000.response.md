Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the values ' ' to sep and sys.stdout to file while popping the 'sep' and 'file' keys from the kwargs dictionary. The values of n, m, and the input grid are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The input grid consists of n rows and m columns, where each cell is either "#" (black) or "." (white).**
Output State: **Precondition: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The input grid consists of n rows and m columns, where each cell is either "#" (black) or "." (white).**
