Example Answer:
The variables `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the iterable object `row`, respectively. The values of `start` and `stop` depend on the contents of `row`, so the output state is `grit` is an iterable object, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of '#' in `row`.
Output State: **`grit` is an iterable object, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of '#' in `row`**
