According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the adjacency values returned by `get_adj(si, sj)`. If there are more adjacent values to iterate over, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more adjacent values to iterate over.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1, for the loop to execute one more time there must be additional adjacent values to iterate over**.
