Example Answer:
The tuple `(ai, aj)` is appended to the stack for further processing. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, and the tuple `(ai, aj)` is appended to the stack.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, the tuple `(ai, aj)` is appended to the stack**
