Example Answer:
The tuple `(ai, aj)` is appended to the `stack`. The values of `ai` and `aj` are not provided in the initial state, so the specific values added to the `stack` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1, and a tuple `(ai, aj)` is appended to the `stack`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1, and a tuple `(ai, aj)` is appended to the `stack`**
