According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is an iterable object with at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `at_start` being True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `args` is an iterable object with at least one element and `x` is the first element in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is an iterable object with at least one element, `x` is the first element in `args`**
