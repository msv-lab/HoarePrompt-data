Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and then written to the file. The loop will execute one more time as there is at least one more element in `args`. The value of `at_start` remains False. 
Output State: **`at_start` is False and there is at least one more element in `args` for the loop to execute one more time.**
