Example Answer:
The `write` method is called on the `file` object with the `sep` argument. This action does not affect the `at_start` variable, and the loop will continue executing as long as there are more elements in `args`. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`at_start` is False**
