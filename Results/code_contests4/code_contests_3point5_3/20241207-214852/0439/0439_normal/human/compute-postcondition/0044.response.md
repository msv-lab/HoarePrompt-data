Example Answer:
`component` is assigned the value 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1**
