Example Answer:
The variables `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of `#` in the string `row`. The values of `start` and `stop` depend on the contents of `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `grit` has more elements to iterate over, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of `#` in `row`.
Output State: **`grit` has more elements to iterate over, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of `#` in `row`**
