Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grit` has been iterated over completely, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of `#` in the last `row` of `grit`. If there is a `#` in the last `row` of `grit`, `start` and `stop` will contain the indices of the first and last occurrence of `#` in that `row`. If there is no `#` in the last `row` of `grit`, `start` and `stop` will both be -1.**
