According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the values of `si` and `sj` and the grid state. At the end of the last iteration, `(ai, aj)` were processed. To execute the loop one more time, a new adjacent position `(ai, aj)` needs to be obtained from the `get_adj` function with the current values of `si` and `sj`. 
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000. If the value at position `(ai, aj)` in the grid has not been visited before, then a tuple `(ai, aj)` is appended to the `stack` for further processing. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
