Example Answer:
`start` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `#` in `row` using `find()`, and `stop` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of `#` in `row` using `rfind()`. If `start` is not -1 and there is no '.' between `start` and `stop`, the loop can execute again. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`grit` has more elements to iterate over, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of `#` in `row`. If `start` is not -1 and there is no '.' in the substring of `row` from `start` to `stop`, the loop can execute again**
