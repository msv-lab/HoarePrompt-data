Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid contains only "#" and ".", component is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `get_adj(si, sj)` returns a non-empty list of valid adjacent indices. Additionally, the element at index `ai` and `aj` in the `visited` list is not visited***
