Postcondition: ***`grit` has more elements to iterate over, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of `#` in `row`. If `start` is -1 or if there is a '.' in the substring of `row` from `start` to `stop`, the program completes its execution without returning any specific value.***
