Example Answer:
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the value of `sep` to the file. The current value of `at_start` is False and the loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more element in `args`. The variables `at_start`, `args`, and the file content are not explicitly mentioned, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`at_start` is False**
