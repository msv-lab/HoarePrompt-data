The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function follows several cases:

Case 1: The program returns a list of strings with 'n' elements filled with '.' characters.
Case 2: The program does not return anything explicitly.
Case 3: The program does not return any specific value.
Case 4: The program does not make any changes to the initial state variables and returns nothing.
Case 5: The program returns when the conditions `start` is -1 or the substring from index `start` to index `stop` in `row` contains '.' are satisfied.
Case 6: The program does not return any specific value, it just completes the execution.
Case 7: The program does not return any specific value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to perform various operations based on the different cases mentioned above without accepting any parameters.
