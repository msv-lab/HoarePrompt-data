The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It processes data specified by `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, and handles writing to a file based on certain conditions. The function aims to write elements from `args` to a file, separated by `sep`. It sets the end of the file to '\n' unless specified otherwise in `kwargs`. Additionally, it can flush the file if the 'flush' key is present and set to True in `kwargs`. However, the function lacks clarity on the expected output or return value, as it does not explicitly define these aspects.
