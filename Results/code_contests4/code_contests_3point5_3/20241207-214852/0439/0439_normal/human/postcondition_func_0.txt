The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `grid`. `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. `grid` is a 2D list of characters with `n` rows and `m` columns containing only "#" and "." characters. The function iterates through the grid elements, counting the total sum of components based on the result of the `dfs` function. After all iterations, it returns the total sum of components. The functionality does not handle cases where `grid` contains characters other than "#" and ".", or cases where `n` and `m` are outside the specified range.
