Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. The code first reads the input, checks if there are any valid placements of magnets according to the conditions given, and then calculates the minimum number of north magnets required if a valid placement is possible. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` handle the input processing, magnet placement validation, and output respectively.

The code checks for all the conditions mentioned in the problem description such as having at least one south magnet in every row and column, determining if a north magnet can occupy a black cell after operations, and ensuring that a north magnet cannot occupy a white cell after operations. 

Additionally, the code handles edge cases like when there are no black cells in the grid where the output should be 0, or when it is impossible to place magnets according to the conditions where the output should be -1.

Overall, the code seems to be logically correct and covers all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description.
