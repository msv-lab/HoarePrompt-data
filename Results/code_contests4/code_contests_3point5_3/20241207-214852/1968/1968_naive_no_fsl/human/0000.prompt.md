You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A championship is held in Berland, in which n players participate. The player with the number i has a_i (a_i ≥ 1) tokens.

The championship consists of n-1 games, which are played according to the following rules:

  * in each game, two random players with non-zero tokens are selected; 
  * the player with more tokens is considered the winner of the game (in case of a tie, the winner is chosen randomly); 
  * the winning player takes all of the loser's tokens; 



The last player with non-zero tokens is the winner of the championship.

All random decisions that are made during the championship are made equally probable and independently.

For example, if n=4, a = [1, 2, 4, 3], then one of the options for the game (there could be other options) is: 

  * during the first game, the first and fourth players were selected. The fourth player has more tokens, so he takes the first player's tokens. Now a = [0, 2, 4, 4]; 
  * during the second game, the fourth and third players were selected. They have the same number of tokens, but in a random way, the third player is the winner. Now a = [0, 2, 8, 0]; 
  * during the third game, the second and third players were selected. The third player has more tokens, so he takes the second player's tokens. Now a = [0, 0, 10, 0]; 
  * the third player is declared the winner of the championship. 



Championship winners will receive personalized prizes. Therefore, the judges want to know in advance which players have a chance of winning, i.e have a non-zero probability of winning the championship. You have been asked to find all such players. 

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case consists of one positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of players in the championship.

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of tokens the players have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. 

Output

For each test case, print the number of players who have a nonzero probability of winning the championship. On the next line print the numbers of these players in increasing order. Players are numbered starting from one in the order in which they appear in the input.

    (be, en, ans) = (0, n - 1, n)
    while be <= en:
        md = be + en >> 1
        su = sum(a[:md + 1])
        for i in range(md + 1, n):
            if su < a[i]:
                su = -1
                break
            su += a[i]
        if su == -1:
            be = md + 1
        else:
            en = md - 1
            ans = md + 1
    out.append(n - ans + 1)
    out.append(' '.join(map(str, [x for x in range(ans, n + 1)])))
pr(out, '\n')

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
