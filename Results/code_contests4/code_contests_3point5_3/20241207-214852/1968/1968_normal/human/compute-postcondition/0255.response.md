Example Answer:
The value of `en` is assigned `md - 1`, where `md` is a variable not defined in the initial state. The output state will be: `su` is either the sum of elements of list `a` from index `md + 1` to index `n - 1`, or it is not equal to -1. `i` is equal to `n`, `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`.
Output State: **`su` is either the sum of elements of list `a` from index `md + 1` to index `n - 1`, or it is not equal to -1. `i` is equal to `n`, `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`**
