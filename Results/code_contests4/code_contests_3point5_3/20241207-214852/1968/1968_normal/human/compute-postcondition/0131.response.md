According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `md`, `su`, `n`, and `i`. If `su` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in list `a`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are as follows: 
`md` is the average of `be` and `en`, 
`su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, 
`n` is greater than `md + 1`, 
`i` is equal to `md + 1`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `su` must be greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in list `a` and `i` must be incremented by 1.
State: **`md` is the average of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `md + 2`**
