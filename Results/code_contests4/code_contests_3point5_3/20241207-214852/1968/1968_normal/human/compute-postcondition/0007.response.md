Example Answer:
The lambda function `pr` is defined, which takes two arguments `args` and `sep`, converts each element of `args` to a string, joins them with the separator `sep`, and writes the result to the standard output followed by a new line. The initial state variables are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input, `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from the standard input, splits them based on whitespaces, and converts each element to an integer, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rint` lambda function `n` times, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rints` lambda function `n` times.**
