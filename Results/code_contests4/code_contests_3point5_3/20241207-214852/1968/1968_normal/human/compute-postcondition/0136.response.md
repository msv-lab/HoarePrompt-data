According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `md`, `su`, `n`, and `i`. If the sum `su` is less than the element at index `i`, the loop breaks. At the end of the last iteration, `md` is the average of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1` plus the element at index `i`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `md + 2`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`md` is the average of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1` plus the element at index `i`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `md + 3`**.
