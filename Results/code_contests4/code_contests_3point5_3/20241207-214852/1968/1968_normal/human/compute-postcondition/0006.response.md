Example Answer:
The lambda function `rints_2d` is defined to create a 2D list by calling the `rints` lambda function `n` times. This means that `rints` lambda function will be called `n` times to create the 2D list. The initial state variables `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rstr_2d`, `rint`, `rints`, and `rint_2d` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input, `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from the standard input, splits them based on whitespaces, and converts each element to an integer, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rint` lambda function `n` times, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rints` lambda function `n` times**
