Postcondition: ***`ceil1` is a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of input integers, `be` is an integer, `en` is an integer, `ans` is an integer, `md` is the floor division result of (be + en) by 2, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` starting from index `md + 1` until the end of the list. If the sum of elements in list `a` starting from index `md + 1` until the end of the list is -1, then `be` is updated to `md + 1`, `en` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `md` is recalculated, and `su` is set to the sum of elements in list `a` starting from index `md + 1` until the end of the list. Otherwise, `be` remains 0, `en` is updated to `md - 1`, `ans` is updated to `md + 1`, `md` is recalculated, and `su` is updated to the sum of elements in list `a` starting from index `md + 1` until the end of the list, with the sum not being -1.***
