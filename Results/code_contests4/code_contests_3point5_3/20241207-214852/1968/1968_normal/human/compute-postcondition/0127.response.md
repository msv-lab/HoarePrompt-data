Example Answer:
Initially, `su` is assigned the value -1. This assignment does not affect any other variables since no calculations are involved. Therefore, the Output State is: `md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `md + 1`, `su` is less than the element at index `i` in `a`, and `su` is -1.
Output State: **`md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `md + 1`, `su` is less than the element at index `i` in `a`, and `su` is -1**
