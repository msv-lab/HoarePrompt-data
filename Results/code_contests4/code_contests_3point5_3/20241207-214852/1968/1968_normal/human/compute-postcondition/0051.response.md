Output State: **`ceil1` is a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of input integers, `be` and `en` satisfy the condition `be <= en`, `ans`, `md` is calculated as the floor division of `be + en` by 2, for the loop to execute the second time, `n` is greater than or equal to `md + 2`, if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is -1. After the execution of the if block, if `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su` is set to -1, otherwise, `su` remains unchanged, `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`.**
