Postcondition: ***`out` has a new value appended, `be` is adjusted to a value less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is calculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least `md + 2`, and the sum of elements up to index `i` is less than `a[i]`***
