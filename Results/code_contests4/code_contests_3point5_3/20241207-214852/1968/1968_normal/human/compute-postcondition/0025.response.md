Output State: **`ceil1` is a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of input integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is the floor division result of (be + en) by 2, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `i`, for the loop to execute the second time `n` must be greater than `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
