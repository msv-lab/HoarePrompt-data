Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `su`, `out`, `ans`, `md`, `n`, `i`, `a`, are all appropriately initialized and modified according to the given conditions. If `su` < `a[i]`, then `su` is -1, `out` has a new value appended, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `en` is either `n - 1` or `md - 1`, `ans` is either `n` or `md + 1`, `md` is recalculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is at least `md + 2`, `su` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]`, `i` is increased by 1.***
