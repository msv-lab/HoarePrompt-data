Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `rint()`, which is a function that takes an input and converts it to an integer. `a` is assigned the sorted list of integers returned by the function `rints()`. The behavior of `rints()` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: a new value is appended to the list `out`, for the loop to execute a second time the input must be greater than 1.
Output State: **a new value is appended to the list `out`, for the loop to execute a second time the input must be greater than 1**
