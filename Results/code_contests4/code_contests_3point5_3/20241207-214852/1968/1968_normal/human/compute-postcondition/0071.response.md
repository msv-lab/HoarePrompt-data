Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `ceil1` remains a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su`, and `i` maintain their initial values described in the precondition. The condition `su < a[i]` was never met, so `su` remains the sum of elements in the list `a` from the beginning to index `md + 1`. The loop does not execute further, `n` is not greater than `md + 1`, and `i` is not `md + 1`.***
