Example Answer:
The lambda function `ceil1` takes two arguments `a` and `b`, performs the operation `(a + b - 1) // b`, and returns the result. The lambda function `ceil1` is assigned to the variable `ceil1`, and an empty list is assigned to the variable `out`. There are no other variables affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`ceil1` is a lambda function that calculates the ceiling division of two numbers, `out` is an empty list**
