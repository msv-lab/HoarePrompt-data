Output State: **`md` is the average of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, if `su` is less than the last element in `a`, then `su` is -1 and the loop breaks, otherwise `su` is updated by adding the last element in `a`.**
