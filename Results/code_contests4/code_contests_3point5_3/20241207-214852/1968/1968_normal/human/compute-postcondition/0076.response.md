Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `ceil1` remains a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `i` are the same as the initial values. If the sum of elements in the list `a` from the beginning to index `md + 1` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is -1.***
