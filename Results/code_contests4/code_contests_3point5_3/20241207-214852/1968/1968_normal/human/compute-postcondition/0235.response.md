According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. The loop starts from `md + 1` and goes up to `n-1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`out` has a new value appended, `be` is equal to `(md + 1) + 1`, `en` is either `(n - 1) - 1` or `(md - 1) - 1`, `ans` is either `n` or `md + 1`, `su` is the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is at least `md + 2`, `md` is recalculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`, the loop has finished executing and `su` remains the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1`, `i` is at least `n`, and the loop will not execute again, `md` is assigned the value `be + en >> 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to `md + 1` and `n` is greater than `md + 1`**
