Example Answer:
`rstrs` is assigned a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string. The lambda function is stored in `rstrs`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string**
