According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ceil1` remains a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `i` are the same as the initial values. If the sum of elements in the list `a` from the beginning to index `md + 1` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is -1. `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **At the start of the next iteration, `ceil1` remains a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` are the same as the initial values, `i` is incremented by 1**
