According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user. If the input is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a new value is appended to the list `out`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the input provided by the user must be greater than 1.
State: **a new value is appended to the list `out`, for the loop to execute a second time the input must be greater than 1**
