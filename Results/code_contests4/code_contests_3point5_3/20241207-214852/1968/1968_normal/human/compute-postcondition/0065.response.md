Output State: **At the end of the if-else block, `ceil1` is a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of input integers, `be` is updated to `md + 1` if the condition `su < a[i]` was never met and the loop can execute again, `en` satisfies the condition `be <= en`, `ans` is either updated to `md + 1` or remains the same, `md` is calculated as the floor division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is equal to the sum of elements in the list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n` if the condition `su < a[i]` is never met.**
