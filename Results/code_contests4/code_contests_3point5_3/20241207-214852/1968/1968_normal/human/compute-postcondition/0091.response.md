Output State: **At the end of the loop, `ceil1` remains a lambda function, `out` has one more element appended which is `n - ans + 1`, `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` have their final updated values, `su` is either the sum of elements in the list `a` from the beginning to index `md + 1` or -1 if the condition `su < a[i]` was met during the loop. If `su` is -1, `be` is updated to `md + 1`, otherwise `en` is updated to `md - 1` and `ans` is updated to `md + 1**.
