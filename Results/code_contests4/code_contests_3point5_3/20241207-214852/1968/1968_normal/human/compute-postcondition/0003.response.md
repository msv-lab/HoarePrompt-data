Example Answer:
`rint` is assigned a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer. The initial state variables `rstr`, `rstrs`, and `rstr_2d` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input**
