According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If the input value is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ceil1` being a lambda function and `out` being an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the input value is greater than 0.
State: **`ceil1` is a lambda function that calculates the ceiling division of two numbers, `out` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time the input value is greater than 0**
