Example Answer:
`su` is assigned the sum of elements in the list `a` up to index `md + 1`. The value of `md` is calculated as `(be + en) >> 1`, where `be` and `en` are not given. Therefore, the output state is: `md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`.
Output State: **`md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`**
