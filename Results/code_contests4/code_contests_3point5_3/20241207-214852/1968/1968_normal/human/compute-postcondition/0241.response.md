According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `su`, `a[i]`, `md`, and `n`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, the loop exits. Otherwise, `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is set to -1 and the loop is exited. Otherwise, `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. 

To execute one more time, the condition `su` less than `a[i]` must not be met, so `su` should be greater than or equal to `a[i]`. The loop should start with the next value of `i` after the previous iteration, so `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **If `su` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1**
