Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`, where `>>` is the right shift operator. The values of `be` and `en` are adjusted to be less than `en` and `en` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `md` is calculated based on these values. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`out` has a new value appended, `be` is adjusted to a value less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is calculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`.**
