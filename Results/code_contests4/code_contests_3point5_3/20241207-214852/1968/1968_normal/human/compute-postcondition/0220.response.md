According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least `md + 2`, `i` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be at least `md + 2`, `i` would be `md + 1` + 1 which is `md + 2`.
State: **`be`, `en`, `su` updated based on the conditions, `out` has a new value appended, `ans` is either `n` or `md + 1`, `md` recalculated, `n` is at least `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`**
