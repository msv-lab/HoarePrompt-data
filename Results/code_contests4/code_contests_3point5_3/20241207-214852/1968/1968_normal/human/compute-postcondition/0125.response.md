According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. If `n` is greater than `md + 1`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1` and `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `md + 1`.
State: **`md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `md + 1`**
