Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `ceil1` is a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of input integers, `be` and `en` satisfy the condition `be <= en`, `ans`, `md` is calculated as the floor division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is equal to the sum of elements in the list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n` if the condition `su < a[i]` is never met. If the condition is met at any point, `su` is set to -1 and the loop breaks. Additionally, the condition `(su != -1)` holds true after not entering the if block***
