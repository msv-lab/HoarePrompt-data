Example Answer:
The lambda function `rstr_2d` takes an input `n` and creates a 2D list by calling the lambda function `rstr` `n` times. The lambda function `rstr` reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces. Therefore, after executing the code, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times**
