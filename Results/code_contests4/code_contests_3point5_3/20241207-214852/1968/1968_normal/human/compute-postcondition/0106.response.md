Example Answer: 
`su` is assigned the value -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` starts from `md + 2`, `n` is the upper limit, `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`.
Output State: **`md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` starts from `md + 2`, `n` is the upper limit, `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`**
