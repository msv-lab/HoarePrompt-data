Example Answer: 
A list comprehension is used to generate a list of numbers from `ans` to `n + 1`, which are then converted to strings and joined with spaces. This resulting string is then appended to the list `out`. Since the initial state is not provided, the output state after this code execution is: a new value is appended to the list `out`.
Output State: **a new value is appended to the list `out`**
