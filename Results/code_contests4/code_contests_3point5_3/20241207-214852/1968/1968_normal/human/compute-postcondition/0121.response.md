Postcondition: ***`md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the upper limit, `su` is either equal to the sum of elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `n - 1`, `su` is equal to -1, `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1` if `su` is -1. Otherwise, if `su` is not -1, `md` is less than `n - 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the upper limit, `su` is either equal to the sum of elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `n - 1`, `en` is equal to `md - 1`, `ans` is equal to `md + 1`***
