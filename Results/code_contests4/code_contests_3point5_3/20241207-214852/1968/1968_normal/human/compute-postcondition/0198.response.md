Output State: **`out` has a new value appended, `be` is adjusted to a value less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is recalculated, `su` is updated, `n` is at least `md + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` becomes -1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
