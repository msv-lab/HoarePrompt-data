Postcondition: ***At the end of the if else block, `ceil1` remains a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` maintain their initial values. `su` is either the sum of elements in the list `a` from the beginning to index `md + 1` or -1 if the condition `su < a[i]` was met during the loop. If `su` is -1, `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. If `su` is not equal to -1, `ans` is updated to `md + 1`.***
