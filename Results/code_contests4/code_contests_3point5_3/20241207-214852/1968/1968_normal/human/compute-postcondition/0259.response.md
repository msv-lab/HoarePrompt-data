Example Answer:
The value of `n - ans + 1` is appended to the list `out`. The value of `n` is known to be equal to `i`, and the value of `ans` can be either `n` or the final value of `md + 1`. Therefore, the final output state is: `out` has a new value appended, `be` is either undetermined or equal to `md + 1`, `en` is either undetermined or equal to `md - 1`, `ans` is either `n` or the final value of `md + 1`, `md` is the final value calculated based on the last values of `be` and `en`, `su` is either -1 or the final sum of elements of list `a` from index `md + 1` to index `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n`.
Output State: **`out` has a new value appended, `be` is either undetermined or equal to `md + 1`, `en` is either undetermined or equal to `md - 1`, `ans` is either `n` or the final value of `md + 1`, `md` is the final value calculated based on the last values of `be` and `en`, `su` is either -1 or the final sum of elements of list `a` from index `md + 1` to index `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n`**
