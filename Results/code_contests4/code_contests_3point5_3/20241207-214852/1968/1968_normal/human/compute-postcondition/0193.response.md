Output State: **`out` has a new value appended, `be` is adjusted to a value less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is calculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`, `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i`, `n` is at least `md + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1. If the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1` is less than the element at index `i`, then the loop breaks out.**
