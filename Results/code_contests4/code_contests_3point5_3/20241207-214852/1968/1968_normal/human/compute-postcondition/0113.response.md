Postcondition: ***`md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `su` is updated based on the new `a[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su` is assigned the value -1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
