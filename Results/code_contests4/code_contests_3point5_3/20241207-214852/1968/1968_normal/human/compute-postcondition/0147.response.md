Postcondition: ***`md` is the average of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If `su` is less than the last element in `a`, then `su` is -1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `su` is updated by adding the last element in `a`. If `su` is -1, `be` is equal to `md + 1`. If `su` is not -1, `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`, and the loop continues with `su` being updated by adding the last element in `a` if necessary. Finally, `ans` is `md + 1`.***
