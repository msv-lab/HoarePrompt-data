Output State: **`md` is the average of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute again `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `md` is assigned the value `be + en >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to `md + 1`, the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1` is less than the element at index `i` in `a`, `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
