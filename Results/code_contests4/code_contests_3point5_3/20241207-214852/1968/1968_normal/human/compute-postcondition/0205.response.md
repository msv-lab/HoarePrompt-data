Postcondition: ***`out` has a new value appended, `be` is either `md + 1` or adjusted to a value less than `en`, `en` is either `n - 1` or `md - 1`, `ans` is either `n` or `md + 1`, `md` is recalculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is at least `md + 2`. If `su` is less than any of the elements in the sublist from index `md + 1` to `n - 1`, then `su` is -1. Otherwise, `su` is not equal to -1.***
