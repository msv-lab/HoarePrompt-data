Example Answer:
`su` is updated by adding `a[i]`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `md`, `n`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` starts from `md + 2`, `n` is the upper limit, `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
