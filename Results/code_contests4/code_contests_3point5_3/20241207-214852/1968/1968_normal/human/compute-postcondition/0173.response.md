Postcondition: ***`md` is `be + en >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n`, `su` is either the sum of elements in `a` from index `md + 1` to `n` or -1 if `su` is less than any element in that range. If `su` is -1, then `be` is updated to `md + 1`. If `su` is not equal to -1, then `en` is updated to `md - 1` and `ans` is set to `md + 1`.***
