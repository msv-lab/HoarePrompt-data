According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `md` and `n`. If `n` is at least `md + 2`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions need to be adjusted so that the loop can execute. 
State: **`out` has a new value appended, `be` is adjusted to a value less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is calculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least `md + 2`**
