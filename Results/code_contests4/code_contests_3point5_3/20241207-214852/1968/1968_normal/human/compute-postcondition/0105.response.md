According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `md`, `n`, `i`, and `su`. If `md` is less than `n - 1` and `su` is not less than `a[i]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` starts from `md + 1`, `n` is the upper limit, and `su` is updated by adding `a[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `su` is less than `a[i]`. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, `md` should still be less than `n - 1`, `i` should be updated to `i + 1`, and `su` should be updated by adding `a[i]`. 
State: **`md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` starts from `md + 2`, `n` is the upper limit, `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`**
