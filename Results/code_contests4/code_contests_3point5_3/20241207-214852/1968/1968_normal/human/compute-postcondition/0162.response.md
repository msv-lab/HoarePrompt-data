According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `md` is `be + en >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in `a`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `n`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`md` is `be + en >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in `a`**
