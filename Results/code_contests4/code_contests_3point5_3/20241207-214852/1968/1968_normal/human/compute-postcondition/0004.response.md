Example Answer:
The lambda function `rints` is defined to read integers from the standard input, split them based on whitespaces, and convert each element to an integer. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input, `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from the standard input, splits them based on whitespaces, and converts each element to an integer.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input, `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from the standard input, splits them based on whitespaces, and converts each element to an integer**
