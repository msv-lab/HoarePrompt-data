According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1` if `su` is -1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `be` should be less than or equal to `en`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the upper limit, `su` is either equal to the sum of elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `n - 1`, `su` is equal to -1, `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1` if `su` is -1, for the loop to execute again `be` should be less than or equal to `en`**
