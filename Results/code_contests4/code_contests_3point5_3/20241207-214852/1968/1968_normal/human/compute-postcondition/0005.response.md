Example Answer:
`rint_2d` is assigned a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rint` lambda function `n` times. Since the initial state does not mention the value of `n`, the exact size of the 2D list cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input, `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from the standard input, splits them based on whitespaces, and converts each element to an integer, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rint` lambda function `n` times.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips whitespaces, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, splits it based on whitespaces, and converts each element to a string, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling `rstr` `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the standard input, `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from the standard input, splits them based on whitespaces, and converts each element to an integer, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rint` lambda function `n` times**.
