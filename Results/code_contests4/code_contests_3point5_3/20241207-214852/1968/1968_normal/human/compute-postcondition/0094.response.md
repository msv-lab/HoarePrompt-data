Output State: **At the end of the loop, `ceil1` remains a lambda function, `out` has one more element appended which is `' '.join(map(str, [x for x in range(ans, n + 1)]))`, `n` and `a` are assigned values after converting the input to integers and sorting them. `su` is either the sum of elements in the list `a` from the beginning to index `md + 1` or -1 if the condition `su < a[i]` was met during the loop. If `su` is -1, `be` is updated to `md + 1`, otherwise `en` is updated to `md - 1` and `ans` is updated to `md + 1**.
