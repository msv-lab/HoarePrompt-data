Output State: **`ceil1` is a lambda function, `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of input integers, `be` and `en` satisfy the condition `be <= en`, `ans`, `md` is calculated as the floor division of `be + en` by 2, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than or equal to `md + 1`, if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is -1, `su` is increased by the value of `a[i]`.**
