Output State: **`ceil1` is a lambda function that calculates the ceiling division of two numbers, `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of input integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is the floor division result of (be + en) by 2, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md` + the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, if the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md` is less than the element at index `i` in list `a`, then we break out of the loop or if statement.**
