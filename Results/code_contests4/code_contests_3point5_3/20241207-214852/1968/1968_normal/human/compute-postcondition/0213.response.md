Postcondition: ***`out` has a new value appended, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `en` is either `n - 1` or `md - 1`, `ans` is either `n` or `md + 1`, `md` is recalculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is at least `md + 2`, for the loop to execute again `be` should be less than or equal to `en`, the sum of elements up to index `md + 1` is less than `a[i]`, `su` is -1***
