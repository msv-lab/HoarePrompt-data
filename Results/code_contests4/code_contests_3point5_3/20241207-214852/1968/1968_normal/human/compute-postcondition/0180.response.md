According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `be` needs to be adjusted to a value less than `en`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`out` has a new value appended, `be` is adjusted to a value less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n**
