Example Answer:
`be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The value of `md` is not provided, so the exact value of `be` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements of list `a` from index `md + 1` to index `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `su` is equal to -1, `be` is the value of `md + 1` which is undetermined.
Output State: **`su` is either -1 or the sum of elements of list `a` from index `md + 1` to index `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `su` is equal to -1, `be` is the value of `md + 1` which is undetermined**
