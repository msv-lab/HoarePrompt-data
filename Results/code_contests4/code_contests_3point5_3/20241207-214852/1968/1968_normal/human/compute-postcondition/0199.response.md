Output State: **`out` has a new value appended, `be` is adjusted to a value less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is calculated based on the new values of `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements of list `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is at least `md + 2`. If `su` is less than any of the elements in the sublist from index `md + 1` to `n - 1`, then `su` is -1.**
