Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2. The values of `be` and `en` are not specified, but we know `be` must be less than or equal to `en` for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, `md` would be the middle value between `be` and `en` based on the condition provided. Hence, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is the middle value between `be` and `en`.
Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is the middle value between `be` and `en`**
