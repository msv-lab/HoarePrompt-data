Output State: **`md` is `be + en >> 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to index `md + 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in `a`. If the sum `su` is less than the element at index `i` in array `a`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
