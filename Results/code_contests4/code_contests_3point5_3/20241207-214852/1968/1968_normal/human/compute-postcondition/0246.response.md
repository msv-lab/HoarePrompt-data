According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `su`, `a[i]`, `md`, and `n`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, the loop will exit. If `su` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]` and `i` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop exited, meaning `su` was less than `a[i]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `su` must be greater than or equal to `a[i]`. 

State: **If `su` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]` and `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `su` must be greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**
