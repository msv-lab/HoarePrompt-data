Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input, sorts the players based on their tokens, and then uses a binary search algorithm to find the number of players with a non-zero probability of winning the championship. It then outputs the count and the player numbers in increasing order. The program handles all test cases as described in the problem description and produces the expected output.
