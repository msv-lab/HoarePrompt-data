Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the BMI for each student using the provided formula and checks if the BMI is equal to or greater than 25. It then prints the student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher. The program iterates through each input line, splits it into student ID, weight, and height, converts weight and height to float values, calculates the BMI, and checks if it is equal to or greater than 25. If the BMI is 25 or higher, it prints the student ID. The program covers all potential cases and accurately identifies students suspected of being obese.
