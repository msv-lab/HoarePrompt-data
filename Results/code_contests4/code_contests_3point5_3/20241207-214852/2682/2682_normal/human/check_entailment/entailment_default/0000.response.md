Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads input data for multiple students, each identified by a student ID, weight, and height.
- It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each student based on the weight and height provided.
- If the BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0, it prints the student ID.
- The code handles at most 50 students and processes their data to identify those with a high BMI.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case and the output hints accurately describe the functionality of the code. Each student's BMI is correctly calculated and if it is 25 or higher, the student ID is printed as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
