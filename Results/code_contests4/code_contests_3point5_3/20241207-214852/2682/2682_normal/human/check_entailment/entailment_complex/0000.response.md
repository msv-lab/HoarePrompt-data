Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads input data for multiple students, calculates the BMI for each student, and outputs the student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher. The program iterates over each student's data, calculates the BMI using the provided formula, and prints the student ID if the BMI is 25 or higher. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description. The program handles at most 50 students and accurately identifies those with a high BMI.
