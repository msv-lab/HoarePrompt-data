You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Obesity is cited as the cause of many adult diseases. In the past, with a few exceptions, it was unrelated to high school students. However, it is no longer unrealistic to suffer from lack of exercise due to excessive studying for entrance exams, or to become bulimia nervosa due to stress. It may be a problem that high school students should be fully interested in.

So you decided to work as an assistant to a teacher in the health room to create a program to find students suspected of being obese from student data.

The method is to calculate a numerical value called BMI (Body Mass Index). BMI is given by the following formula.

<image>


BMI = 22 is standard, and above 25 is suspected of being obese.

Create a program that calculates BMI from each student's weight and height information and outputs the student ID numbers of 25 or more students.



input

The input is given in the following format:


s1, w1, h1
s2, w2, h2
...
...


si (1 ≤ si ≤ 2,000), wi (1 ≤ wi ≤ 200), hi (1.0 ≤ hi ≤ 2.0) are the student ID numbers (integers), weight (real numbers), and height (real numbers) of the i-th student, respectively. Represents.

The number of students does not exceed 50.

output

The student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher are output on one line in the order in which they were entered.

Example

Input

1001,50.0,1.60
1002,60.0,1.70
1003,70.0,1.80
1004,80.0,1.70
1005,90.0,1.60


Output

1004
1005
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each input line contains a student ID (si), weight (wi), and height (hi) where 1 ≤ si ≤ 2,000, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 200, and 1.0 ≤ hi ≤ 2.0. The number of students is at most 50.**
def func():
    for line in stdin:
        number, weight, height = line.split(',')
        
        if 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) ** 2:
            print(number)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, the program will print the `number` of the students whose weight divided by the square of their height is greater than or equal to 25.0.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
