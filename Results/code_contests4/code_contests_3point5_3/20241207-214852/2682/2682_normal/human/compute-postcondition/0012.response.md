Postcondition: ***`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values based on the input `line.split(',')`. If the condition 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) ** 2 is satisfied, then the program continues with the same values. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `number`, `weight`, and `height`.***
