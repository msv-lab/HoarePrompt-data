Example Answer:
The `line` is split by commas into three parts: `number`, `weight`, and `height`. Assuming the standard input stream contains valid student data with at least one student ID, weight, and height, the values of `number`, `weight`, and `height` will be assigned accordingly. 
Output State: **`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the split `line`**
