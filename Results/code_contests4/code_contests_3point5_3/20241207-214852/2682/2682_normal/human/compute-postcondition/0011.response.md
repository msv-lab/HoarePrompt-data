Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of the variable `number`. The values of `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned based on the input `line.split(',')`, but since we do not have the specific input, we cannot determine the exact values of `number`, `weight`, and `height`. Therefore, the Output State is: `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values based on the input `line.split(',')`.
Output State: **`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values based on the input `line.split(',')`**
