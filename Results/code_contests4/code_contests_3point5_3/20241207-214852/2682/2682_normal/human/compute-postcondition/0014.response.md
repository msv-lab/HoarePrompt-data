The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to handle the data of multiple students, each identified by a student ID (si), weight (wi), and height (hi) where 1 ≤ si ≤ 2,000, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 200, and 1.0 ≤ hi ≤ 2.0. The number of students is at most 50. The function is expected to process this data in some way, but the specific functionality is not provided.
