Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input data for multiple students, each identified by a student ID, weight, and height. It then calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each student based on the weight and height provided. If the BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0, it prints the student ID. The function does not accept any parameters. It handles at most 50 students and processes their data to identify those with a high BMI. **
