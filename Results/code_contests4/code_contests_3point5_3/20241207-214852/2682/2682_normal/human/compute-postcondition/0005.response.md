According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `weight` and `height`. If the condition `weight / (height * height) >= 25.0` is met, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the split `line`, and the condition is met. So for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `number`, `weight`, and `height` should be updated from the next `line`.
State: **`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the next `line`, if the weight divided by the square of the height is greater than or equal to 25.0, then the condition is met**
