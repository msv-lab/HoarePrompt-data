Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. It only checks if Limak ends at the North Pole, but it does not enforce the rules of only being able to move from North to South if on the North Pole, and from South to North if on the South Pole.

For example, in the input:
```
2
1000 North
1000 South
```
The program should output "NO" because Limak will not end at the North Pole and violates the rules of the journey.
