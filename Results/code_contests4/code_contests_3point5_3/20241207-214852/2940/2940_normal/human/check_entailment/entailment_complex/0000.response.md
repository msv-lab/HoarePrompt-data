Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values representing Limak's journey, updates the `height` variable based on the direction and distance traveled, and checks if the final height remains within the constraints specified in the problem description. It enforces the conditions that Limak can only move from North to South if he is on the North Pole and vice versa, and the journey must end on the North Pole. The program prints 'YES' if these conditions are satisfied and 'NO' if they are not.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the conditions specified. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
