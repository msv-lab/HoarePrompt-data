Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through each part of Limak's journey, updating the height based on the direction he moves. It checks if Limak stays within the height constraints and ends the journey at the North Pole. Finally, it prints "YES" if all conditions are satisfied, and "NO" otherwise.

The program ensures that Limak can only move south if he is at the North Pole, and only move north if he is at the South Pole. It also checks that Limak ends the journey at the North Pole. These conditions are correctly validated within the loop, and the final output is based on whether all conditions are met.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
