The function `func` reads input values representing Limak's journey, updates the `height` variable based on the direction and distance traveled, and checks if the final height remains within the constraints. If the final height is within the constraints, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is determined based on the journey input and height constraints.
