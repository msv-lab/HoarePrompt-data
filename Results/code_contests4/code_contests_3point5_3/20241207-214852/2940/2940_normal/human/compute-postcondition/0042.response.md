Postcondition: ***`HEIGHT`, `f`, `n`, `sat`, `i`, `dst`, `direction`, `height` are all updated based on the input values. If the direction is 'North', the program state remains unchanged. If the direction is 'South', the `height` is decreased by the integer value of `dst`. If the direction is neither 'North' nor 'South', a `ValueError` is raised with the message 'Invalid direction'. If `height` is less than 0 or greater than `HEIGHT`, `sat` is False. For the loop to execute another time, `i` should be less than `n`.***
