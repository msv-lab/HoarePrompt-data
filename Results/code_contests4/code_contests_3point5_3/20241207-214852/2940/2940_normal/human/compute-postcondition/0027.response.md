Output State: **`HEIGHT` is updated based on the direction, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `dst` is the next word from input based on the direction, `dst` and `direction` are assigned values from the split result of stripping and splitting the line read from `f`. If the direction is not 'South' or 'North', no changes are made to the program state, `height` is decreased by the integer value of `dst`.**
