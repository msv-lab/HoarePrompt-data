Output State: **`HEIGHT`, `f`, `n`, `sat`, `i`, `dst`, `direction`, `height` are all updated based on the input values. If the loop executes successfully until the end, `sat` remains `True`, indicating that the height constraints were not violated throughout the loop execution. If the loop does not execute at all, the initial state of the variables remains unchanged. The output of the program is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `sat`.**
