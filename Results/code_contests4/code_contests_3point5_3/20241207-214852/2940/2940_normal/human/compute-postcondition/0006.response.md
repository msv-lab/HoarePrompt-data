Example Answer:
`dst` is assigned the first word after stripping the newline character and splitting the input string based on space. `direction` is assigned the second word after the split. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is True, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0, `dst` is the first word from input, `direction` is the second word from input.
Output State: **HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is True, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0, `dst` is the first word from input, `direction` is the second word from input**
