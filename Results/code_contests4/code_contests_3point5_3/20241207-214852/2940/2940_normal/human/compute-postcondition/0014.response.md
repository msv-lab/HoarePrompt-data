Output State: **HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is True, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0, `dst` is the first word from input, `direction` is the second word from input. As the direction is 'North', `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst`.**
