Example Answer:
The variable `f` is assigned the value `sys.stdin`, where `sys.stdin` represents the standard input stream. The value of `HEIGHT` remains 20000. Therefore, the Output State is: HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream.
Output State: **HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream**
