Output State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `HEIGHT` is updated based on the direction, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `dst` is the next word from input based on the direction, `dst` and `direction` are assigned values from the split result of stripping and splitting the line read from `f`. If the direction is 'North', the program state remains unchanged. If the direction is not 'North', no changes are made to the program state.**
