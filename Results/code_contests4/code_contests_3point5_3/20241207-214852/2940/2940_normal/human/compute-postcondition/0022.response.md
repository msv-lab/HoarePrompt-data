Postcondition: ***`HEIGHT` is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is True, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0, `dst` is the first word from input. If direction is 'South', `HEIGHT` is decreased by the integer value of `dst`. If direction is 'North', `HEIGHT` is increased by the integer value of `dst`. If direction is not in {'South', 'North'}, no changes occur in the program variables. If direction is not 'North' and not 'South', a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid direction', leading to an exception being thrown. If `HEIGHT` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is False, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0, `dst` is the first word from input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
