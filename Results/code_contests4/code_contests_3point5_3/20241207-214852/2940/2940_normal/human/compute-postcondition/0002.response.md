Example Answer:
The variable `height` is assigned the value of `HEIGHT`, which is 20000. The variable `f` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream.
Output State: **HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream**
