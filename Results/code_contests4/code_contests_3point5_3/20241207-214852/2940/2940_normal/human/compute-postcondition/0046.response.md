Postcondition: ***`HEIGHT`, `f`, `n`, `sat`, `i`, `dst`, `direction`, `height` are all updated based on the input values. If the direction is 'South' and height < 0 or height > HEIGHT, `sat` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the direction is 'North' and height < 0 or height > HEIGHT, the program state remains unchanged. If the direction is neither 'North' nor 'South' and height < 0 or height > HEIGHT, a `ValueError` is raised with the message 'Invalid direction'. For the loop to execute another time, `i` should be less than `n.***
