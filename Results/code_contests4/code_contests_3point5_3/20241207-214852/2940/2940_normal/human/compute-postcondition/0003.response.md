Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(f.readline())`, where `f.readline()` reads a line from the standard input stream `f` and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will depend on the input read from the standard input stream. Therefore, the Output State is: HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer**
