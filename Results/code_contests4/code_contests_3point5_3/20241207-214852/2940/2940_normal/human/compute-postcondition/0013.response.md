Postcondition: ***HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is True, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0, `dst` is the first word from input, `direction` is the second word from input. If direction is not in {'South', 'North'}, no changes occur in the program variables. The direction is 'North' and hence the program variables related to the 'North' direction are updated accordingly***
