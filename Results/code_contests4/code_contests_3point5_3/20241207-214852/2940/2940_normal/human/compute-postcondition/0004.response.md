Example Answer:
The variable `sat` is assigned the value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is True.
Output State: **HEIGHT is 20000, `f` is assigned the standard input stream, `n` is an input integer, `sat` is True**
