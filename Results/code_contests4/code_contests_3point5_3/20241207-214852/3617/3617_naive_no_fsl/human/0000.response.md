Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible sadness of Snuke as described in the problem. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description. The calculation of `left` and `right` values inside the nested loops is not accurate and does not represent the correct calculation of sadness.

An example to illustrate the incorrectness of the program:
Input:
5
2 2 3 5 5

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
0

The program fails to produce the correct output for this input case, indicating that it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is False.
