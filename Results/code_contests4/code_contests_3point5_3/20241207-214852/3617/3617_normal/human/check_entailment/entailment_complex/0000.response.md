Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input as described, calculates the minimum possible sadness of Snuke as defined in the problem description, and outputs the correct result. The program iterates through each element in the list, calculates the sum of absolute differences to the left and right of each element, and then finds the minimum sum. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
