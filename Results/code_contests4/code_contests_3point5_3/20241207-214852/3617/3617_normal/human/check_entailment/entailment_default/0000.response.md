Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly follow the problem description. The output hints mention that the code calculates the sum of absolute differences to the left and right of each element in the list based on the differences between the elements and their index positions. However, the code does not seem to accurately implement this logic. Additionally, the code does not handle the calculation of minimum possible sadness for Snuke as described in the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the expected output based on the problem description.
