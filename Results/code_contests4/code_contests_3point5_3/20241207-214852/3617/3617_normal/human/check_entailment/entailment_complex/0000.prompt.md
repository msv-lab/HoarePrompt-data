You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Snuke has an integer sequence A of length N.

He will freely choose an integer b. Here, he will get sad if A_i and b+i are far from each other. More specifically, the sadness of Snuke is calculated as follows:

* abs(A_1 - (b+1)) + abs(A_2 - (b+2)) + ... + abs(A_N - (b+N))



Here, abs(x) is a function that returns the absolute value of x.

Find the minimum possible sadness of Snuke.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible sadness of Snuke.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(argv):
    line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
    while line:
        N = int(line)
        
        A = [int(a) for a in raw_input().rstrip('\n').split(' ')]
        
        diff = sorted([(a - (i + 1)) for i, a in enumerate(A)])
        
        m = []
        
        for i in range(N):
            left = 0
            for j in range(0, i):
                left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])
            right = 0
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])
            m.append(left + right)
        
        print(min(m))
        
        line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The loop will continue to execute until the input from the standard input is empty, at which point the loop will terminate. For each iteration, the loop reads an integer `N` from the input and creates a list `A` containing `N` integers. It then calculates the differences between each element of `A` and its index position, sorts these differences, and calculates the sum of absolute differences to the left and right of each element. These sums are stored in list `m`. The minimum value from `m` is printed in each iteration. After the loop finishes, `line` will contain the last input from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input until empty, where each input contains an integer `N` followed by `N` integers. It calculates the sum of absolute differences to the left and right of each element in the list based on the differences between the elements and their index positions. The minimum sum for each element is printed. The function does not specify a return value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
