Correctness: **True**

The program reads an integer `N` from the input and creates a list `A` containing `N` integers. It then calculates the differences between each element of `A` and its index position, sorts these differences, and calculates the sum of absolute differences to the left and right of each element. These sums are stored in list `m`. The minimum value from `m` is printed, which corresponds to the minimum possible sadness of Snuke.

The program follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. It correctly calculates the sadness of Snuke by finding the minimum possible value of the sum of absolute differences between the elements of the input sequence and their expected positions. Therefore, the program is correct.
