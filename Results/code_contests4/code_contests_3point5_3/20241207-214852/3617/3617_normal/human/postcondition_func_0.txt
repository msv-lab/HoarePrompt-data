The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input until empty, where each input contains an integer `N` followed by `N` integers. It calculates the sum of absolute differences to the left and right of each element in the list based on the differences between the elements and their index positions. The minimum sum for each element is printed. The function does not specify a return value.
