According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. Since the range starts from 0, the loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `left` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0 in order for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`left` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
