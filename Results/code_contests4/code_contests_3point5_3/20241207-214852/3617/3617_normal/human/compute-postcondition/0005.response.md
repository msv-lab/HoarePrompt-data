Example Answer:
The variable `m` is assigned an empty list. This does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: line is assigned the value of the input read from the standard input, N is an integer value, A is a list of integers created from the input, diff is a sorted list of the differences between elements of A and their indices, m is an empty list.
Output State: **line is assigned the value of the input read from the standard input, N is an integer value, A is a list of integers created from the input, diff is a sorted list of the differences between elements of A and their indices, m is an empty list**
