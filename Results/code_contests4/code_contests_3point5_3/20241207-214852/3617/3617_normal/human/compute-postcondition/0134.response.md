According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a list with at least `N` elements, `i` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`m` is a list with at least `N` elements, `i` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute the next time `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the list `diff**
