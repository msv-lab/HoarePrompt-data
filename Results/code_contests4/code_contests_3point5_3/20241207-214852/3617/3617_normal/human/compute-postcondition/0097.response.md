Output State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end, `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between diff[j] and diff[i], `j` is equal to `i + 1, `m` is appended with the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1` for the loop to execute the first time**
