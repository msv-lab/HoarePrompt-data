According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `m` has at least `N+1` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `left` and `right` have been updated, `j` has been increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i+1`.
State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+1` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `left` has been updated, `right` has been updated, `j` is i+1, `right` is updated again for the loop to execute again**
