Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until the input from the standard input is empty, at which point the loop will terminate. For each iteration, the loop reads an integer `N` from the input and creates a list `A` containing `N` integers. It then calculates the differences between each element of `A` and its index position, sorts these differences, and calculates the sum of absolute differences to the left and right of each element. These sums are stored in list `m`. The minimum value from `m` is printed in each iteration. After the loop finishes, `line` will contain the last input from the standard input.**
