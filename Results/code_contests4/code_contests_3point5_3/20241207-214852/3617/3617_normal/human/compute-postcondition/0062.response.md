Example Answer:
The value from the standard input is read and stored in the variable `line`. The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, but the values of `m` and other variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, `line` contains the input from the standard input.
Output State: **The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, `line` contains the input from the standard input**
