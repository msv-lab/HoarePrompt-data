Example Answer:
A is assigned a list of integers created by converting each element of the input read from the standard input into an integer and splitting the input by spaces. The previous values of line and N are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: line is assigned the value of the input read from the standard input, N is an integer value, A is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **line is assigned the value of the input read from the standard input, N is an integer value, A is a list of integers created from the input**
