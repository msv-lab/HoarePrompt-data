According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a list with at least `N+6` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `N - 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` starting from index `i + 1`, `left` is updated with the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of the updated `left` and `right`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `i + 1`.
State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+6` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `N - 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` starting from index `i + 1`, `left` is updated with the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of the updated `left` and `right`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `i + 1`**
