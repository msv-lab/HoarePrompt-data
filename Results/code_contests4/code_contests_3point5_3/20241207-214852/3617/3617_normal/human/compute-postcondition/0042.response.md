According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the updated values are reflected in the variables. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `N` should remain the same.
State: **At the end of the loop, updated values are reflected in the variables**.
