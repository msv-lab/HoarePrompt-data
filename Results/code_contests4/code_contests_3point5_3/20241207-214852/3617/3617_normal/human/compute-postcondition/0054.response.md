According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `N`, and `j`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i + 1`. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `N` must still be greater than `i + 1`, and `j` must be updated to be `i + 2`.
State: **`left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute again `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2**
