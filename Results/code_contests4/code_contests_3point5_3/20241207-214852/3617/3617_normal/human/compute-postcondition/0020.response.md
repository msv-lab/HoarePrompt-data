According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` should be `i + 3`.
State: **`line` is assigned a value from standard input, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input, `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements of `A` and their indices, `m` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is updated based on the calculation in the code, `j` is equal to `i + 3` for the loop to execute one more time**
