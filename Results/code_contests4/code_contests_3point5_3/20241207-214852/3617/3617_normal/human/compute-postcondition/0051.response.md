Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value 0, and the value of `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is 0.
Output State: **`left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is 0**
