Example Answer:
The value of `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`. The values of `left` and `right` are already calculated based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff` for all pairs `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` where `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `N`, `m` has been updated with the new value.
Output State: **`left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff` for all pairs `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` where `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `N`, `m` has been updated with the new value**
