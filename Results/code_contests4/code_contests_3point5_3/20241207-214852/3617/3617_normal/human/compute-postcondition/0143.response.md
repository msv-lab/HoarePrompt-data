Example Answer:
`right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between all possible pairs of elements in the list `diff`. Since the loop executes while `i + 1` is less than `N`, `right` will be updated accordingly for all valid pairs of `i` and `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list with at least `N` elements, `i` is equal to the length of the list, `left` and `right` are updated by adding the absolute difference between all possible pairs of elements in the list `diff`.
Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N` elements, `i` is equal to the length of the list, `left` and `right` are updated by adding the absolute difference between all possible pairs of elements in the list `diff`**
