Example Answer:
The value of `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`. The previous states of `left` and `right` are not known, but they are calculated based on the absolute differences between pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`. The value of `j` is equal to `N-1`, and `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` except for the first element, `j` is equal to `N-1`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, and `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`.
Output State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` except for the first element, `j` is equal to `N-1`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`**
