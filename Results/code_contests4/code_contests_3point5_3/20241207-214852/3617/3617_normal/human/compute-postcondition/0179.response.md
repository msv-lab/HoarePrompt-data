Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous values of `right`, `diff[j]`, and `diff[i]` are unknown, so the output state is:
Initial State: `m` is a list with at least `N + 7` elements, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `i + 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of the updated `left` and `right`, for the loop to execute the second time `N` must be greater than 1
Output State: **Initial State**
