Example Answer:
`right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state, so the final values of `right` will depend on the specific values of `diff` after the loop execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is the updated final sum of absolute differences after the loop execution, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `N-1.
Output State: **`left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is the updated final sum of absolute differences after the loop execution, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `N-1**
