Example Answer:
The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `i` and `j` are greater than 0 and `j` is always `i + 1`, so the calculation will depend on the elements of the list `diff`. The output state will reflect the updated value of `right`.
Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+1` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 1`, `N` is the upper bound for `j`, `right` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
