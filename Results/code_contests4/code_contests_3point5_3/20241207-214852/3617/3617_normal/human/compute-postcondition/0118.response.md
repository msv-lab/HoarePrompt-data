According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is the updated final sum of absolute differences after the loop execution, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be less than `N-1`.
State: **`left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is the updated final sum of absolute differences after the loop execution, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `N-2**
