According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i+1` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is `i+1`, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than `i+1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `N` must be greater than `i+2`.
State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is `i+1`, `N` is greater than `i+2` for the loop to execute another time**
