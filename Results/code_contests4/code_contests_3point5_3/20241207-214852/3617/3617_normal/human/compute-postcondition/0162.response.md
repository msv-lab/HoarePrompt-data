According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` has at least `N+1` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is the upper bound for `j`, and `right` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 3` and must be less than `N`.
State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+1` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 3`, `N` is the upper bound for `j`, `right` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for the loop to execute one more time**
