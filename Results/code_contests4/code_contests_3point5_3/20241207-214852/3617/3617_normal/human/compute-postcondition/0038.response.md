According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `N` is greater than 3. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 4.
State: **At the end of the loop, `line` is assigned a value from standard input, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input, `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements of `A` and their indices, `m` contains the result of appending `left` and `right` sums, `i` is 3, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid iterations of the loop, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for the current iteration, `j` is 4 for the loop to execute the second time, `N` is greater than 3, `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.**
