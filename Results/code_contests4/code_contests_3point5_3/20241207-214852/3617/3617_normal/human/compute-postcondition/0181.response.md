Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `right`, and `N` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.
Output State: **`right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]**.
