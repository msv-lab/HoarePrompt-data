According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a list with at least `N + 7` elements, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `i + 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of the updated `left` and `right`, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `N` must be greater than 1.
State: **`m` is a list with at least `N + 7` elements, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `i + 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of the updated `left` and `right`, for the loop to execute the second time `N` must be greater than 1**
