Example Answer:
`right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, where `j` is `i+1`. The value of `i`, `j`, and `N` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is `i+1`, `N` is greater than `i+2` for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is `i+1`, `N` is greater than `i+2` for the loop to execute another time**
