According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `line` evaluates to True. Right before the loop, `line` is assigned the value of the input read from the standard input. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the input value of `line` must not be an empty string or a falsy value.
State: **`line` is assigned the value of the input read from the standard input, for the loop to execute the first time `line` must not be an empty string or a falsy value**
