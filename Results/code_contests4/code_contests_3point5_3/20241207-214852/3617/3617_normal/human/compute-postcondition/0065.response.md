Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the integer values of the input separated by spaces. The previous states of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, `line` is not empty for the loop to execute again, `N` is assigned the integer value of `line`. `A` contains the integer values of the input separated by spaces.
Output State: **The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, `line` is not empty for the loop to execute again, `N` is assigned the integer value of `line`. `A` contains the integer values of the input separated by spaces.**
