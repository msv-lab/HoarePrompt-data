According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is greater than 0. Also, the loop will execute `i` times. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+5` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `N`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` starting from index `i + 1`, `left` is 0, a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of `left` and `right`**
