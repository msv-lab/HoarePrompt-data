Example Answer:
`left` is assigned the value 0. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: line is assigned a value from standard input, N is an integer value, A is a list of integers created from the input, diff is a sorted list of differences between elements of A and their indices, m is an empty list, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, `left` is 0.
Output State: **line is assigned a value from standard input, N is an integer value, A is a list of integers created from the input, diff is a sorted list of differences between elements of A and their indices, m is an empty list, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, `left` is 0**
