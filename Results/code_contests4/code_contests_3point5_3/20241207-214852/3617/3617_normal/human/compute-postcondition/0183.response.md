Example Answer:
A new element is appended to list `m`, which is the sum of the updated `left` and `right`. The loop will execute if `N` is greater than 0. The output state is: `m` is a list with at least `N + 8` elements, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `i + 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.
Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N + 8` elements, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than `i + 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
