Example Answer:
`line` is assigned the input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')`, which reads a line of input from the standard input and removes any trailing newline characters. The minimum value in the list `m` is printed, but the value of `m` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: Minimum value in list `m` is printed.
Output State: **Minimum value in list `m` is printed**
