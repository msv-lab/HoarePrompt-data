Example Answer:
The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, where `j` should be less than `i+1` for the loop to execute again. The previous state of `left`, `diff[j]`, and `diff[i]` is unknown, so the output state is: `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` should be less than `i+1`.
Output State: **`left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` should be less than `i+1`**
