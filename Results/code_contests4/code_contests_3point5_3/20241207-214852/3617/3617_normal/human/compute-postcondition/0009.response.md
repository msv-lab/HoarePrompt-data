Example Answer:
`left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous values of `left`, `diff[j]`, and `diff[i]` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is assigned a value from standard input, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input, `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements of `A` and their indices, `m` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `left` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.
Output State: **`line` is assigned a value from standard input, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input, `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements of `A` and their indices, `m` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `left` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]**
