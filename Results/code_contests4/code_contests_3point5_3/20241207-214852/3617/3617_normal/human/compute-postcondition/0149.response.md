Example Answer:
`left` is assigned the value 0. The values of `m`, `i`, and `right` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list with at least `N+2` elements, `i` is equal to the updated length of the list plus 1, `left` is 0, `right` has been updated.
Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+2` elements, `i` is equal to the updated length of the list plus 1, `left` is 0, `right` has been updated**
