Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The variables `m`, `i`, `j`, `N` remain unchanged. Since the initial state of `right` is not provided, the new value of `right` will depend on the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. 
Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+1` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is the upper bound for `j`, `right` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
