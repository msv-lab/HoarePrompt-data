According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `line`. If `line` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the minimum value from the list `m` is printed, so no adjustment is needed for `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `line` needs to be non-empty. 
State: **The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, `line` is not empty for the loop to execute again**
