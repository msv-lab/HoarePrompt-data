Example Answer:
The variable `left` is updated with the absolute difference between the elements at indexes `j` and `i` in the sorted list `diff`. The loop will execute a second time only if `i` is less than `N`+1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, `line` is not empty, `N` is equal to the integer value of `line`, `A` contains integer values separated by spaces, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated with the absolute difference between the elements at indexes `j` and `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `N`+1**
