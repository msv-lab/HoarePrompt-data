Example Answer:
The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The loop iterates through different values of `i` and `j` based on the condition `i` is less than `N-1`. Since the initial value of `right` is 0, the final value of `right` will be the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is the final sum of absolute differences, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is the final value after the loop execution, `N` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `N-1`.
Output State: **`left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is the final sum of absolute differences, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is the final value after the loop execution, `N` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `N-1**.
