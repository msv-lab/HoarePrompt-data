Example Answer:
The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `j` and `i` are provided in the initial state, but the values of `diff` and `N` are not specified, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `left`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is updated with the new absolute difference value, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` except for the first element, `j` is equal to `N-1`, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is increased by 1, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `N-1`.
Output State: **`left` is updated with the new absolute difference value, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` except for the first element, `j` is equal to `N-1`, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is increased by 1, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `N-1`**
