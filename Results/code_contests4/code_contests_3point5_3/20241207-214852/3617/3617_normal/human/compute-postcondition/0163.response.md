Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The variables `m`, `i`, `j`, and `N` are not affected by this operation. The loop will execute one more time as `right` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list with at least `N+1` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 3`, `N` is the upper bound for `j`, `right` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+1` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 3`, `N` is the upper bound for `j`, `right` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for the loop to execute one more time**
