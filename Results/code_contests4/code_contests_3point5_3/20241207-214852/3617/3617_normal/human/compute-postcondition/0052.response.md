According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If N is greater than i + 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, left is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in diff does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to N is greater than i + 1 and j is i + 1.
State: **`left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than i + 1, `j` is i + 1**
