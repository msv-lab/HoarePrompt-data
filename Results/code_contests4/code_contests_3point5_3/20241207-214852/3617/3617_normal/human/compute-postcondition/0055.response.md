Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, where `j = i + 2`. The loop continues to execute as long as `N > i + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `N` is greater than `i + 1, `j` is `i + 2.
Output State: **`left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `N` is greater than `i + 1, `j` is `i + 2**
