According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i+1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` should be less than `i+1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1 and be less than the updated `i+1`.
State: **`left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` should be less than `i+2**
