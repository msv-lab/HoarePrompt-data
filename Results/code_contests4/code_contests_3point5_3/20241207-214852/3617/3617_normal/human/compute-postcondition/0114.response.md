According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `N` is at least 1 and `i` is less than `N-1`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is 0, and `m` is equal to `left`.
State: **`left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is 0, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `N-1`**
