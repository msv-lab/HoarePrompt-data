According to the code, the loop will execute `i` number of times starting from 0. Since `i` is equal to `N` and `N` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. 

Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`left` is 0, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute**
