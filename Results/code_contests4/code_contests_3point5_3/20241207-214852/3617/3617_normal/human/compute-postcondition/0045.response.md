Example Answer:
The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The initial state indicates that `left` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. Since the values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not provided, the exact value of `left` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.
Output State: **`left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]**
