Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, where `j` is `i + 1`. The initial state indicates that `right` is 0, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i + 1`. After executing the code snippet, the value of `right` will change based on the values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, the output state will be based on the updated value of `right`.
Output State: **`left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1**
