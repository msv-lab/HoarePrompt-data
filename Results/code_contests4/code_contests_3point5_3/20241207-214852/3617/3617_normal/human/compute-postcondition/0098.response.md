According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is equal to `N`, and `N` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and become less than `N`.
State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end, `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between diff[j] and diff[i], `j` is equal to `i + 2, `m` is appended with the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+2` for the loop to execute again**
