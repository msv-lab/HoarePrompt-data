Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, where `line` is an input. The exact value of `N` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `line`. Therefore, the Output State is: Output state cannot be determined without the exact values of `left`, `right`, and `m`.
Output State: **Output state cannot be determined without the exact values of `left`, `right`, and `m`**
