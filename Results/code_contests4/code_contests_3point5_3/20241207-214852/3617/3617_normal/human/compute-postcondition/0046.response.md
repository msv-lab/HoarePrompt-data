According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. For the next iteration, `j` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` should be less than `i+1`**
