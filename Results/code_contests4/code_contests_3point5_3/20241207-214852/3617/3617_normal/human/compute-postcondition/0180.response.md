According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the initial state is provided. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 and it should be less than `N`.
State: **`Initial State`, for the loop to execute again `j` should be incremented by 1 and `j` should be less than `N`**
