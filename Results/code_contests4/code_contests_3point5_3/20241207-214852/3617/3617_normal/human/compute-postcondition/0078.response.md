According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If N is at least i+2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, left contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than i+1 and `j` is i+1. 
State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` is 0, `j` is i+1, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than i+1**
