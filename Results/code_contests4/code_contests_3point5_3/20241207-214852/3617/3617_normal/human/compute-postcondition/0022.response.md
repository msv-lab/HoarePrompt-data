Output State: **`line` is assigned a value from standard input, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input, `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements of `A` and their indices, `m` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `N - 1` at the end of the loop**
