Example Answer:
The value of `right` is reassigned to 0. Since `right` was already 0, there is no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is 0, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `right` is 0, `m` is equal to `left`, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0**
