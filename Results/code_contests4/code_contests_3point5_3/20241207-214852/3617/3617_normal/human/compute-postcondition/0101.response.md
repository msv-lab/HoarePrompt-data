Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `N+1` and `N` is greater than or equal to `i+2`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end, `right` is updated with the new absolute difference, `m` is appended with the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `N+1`.
Output State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end, `right` is updated with the new absolute difference, `m` is appended with the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `N+1`**
