Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+7` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `N - 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` starting from index `i + 1`, `left` is updated with the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of the updated `left` and `right`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `i + 1**.
