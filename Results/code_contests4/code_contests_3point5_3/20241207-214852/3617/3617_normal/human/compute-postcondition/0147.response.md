Example Answer:
The list `m` has `N` elements, and `i` is equal to the length of the list. The variables `left` and `right` are updated by adding the absolute difference between all possible pairs of elements in the list `diff`. After that, the sum of `left` and `right` is appended to the list `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list with at least `N+1` elements, `i` is equal to the updated length of the list, `left` and `right` have been updated, and the sum of `left` and `right` has been appended to the list `m`.
Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+1` elements, `i` is equal to the updated length of the list, `left` and `right` have been updated, and the sum of `left` and `right` has been appended to the list `m`**
