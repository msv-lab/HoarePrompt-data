Example Answer:
The variable `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, where `j` is `i+1`. The loop will execute as long as `N` is greater than `i+3`. The variable `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`. 
Output State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is `i+1`, `N` is greater than `i+3` for the loop to execute another time**
