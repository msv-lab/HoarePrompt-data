Example Answer: 
`N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, where `line` is not empty for the loop to execute again. The minimum value from the list `m` is printed. Therefore, the Output State is: The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, `line` is not empty for the loop to execute again, `N` is assigned the integer value of `line`.
Output State: **The minimum value from the list `m` is printed, `line` is not empty for the loop to execute again, `N` is assigned the integer value of `line`**
