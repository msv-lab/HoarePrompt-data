Output State: **`line` is assigned a value from standard input, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input, `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements of `A` and their indices, `m` contains the result of appending `left` and `right` sums, `i` is 2, `left` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `right` is calculated based on `diff` and `i`, for the loop to execute the third time `j` is 2, `left` is updated with the new value based on the calculation**
