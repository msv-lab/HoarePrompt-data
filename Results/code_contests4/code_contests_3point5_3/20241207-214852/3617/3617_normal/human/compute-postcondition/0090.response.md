According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is updated with the new absolute difference value, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` except for the first element, `j` is equal to `N-1`, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is increased by 1, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be less than `N-1`.
State: **`left` is updated with the new absolute difference value, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` except for the first element, `j` is equal to `N-1`, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is increased by 1, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `N-1`**
