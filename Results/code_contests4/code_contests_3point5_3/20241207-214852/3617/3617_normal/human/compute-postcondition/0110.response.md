According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left`, `right`, and `m` have been updated based on the absolute differences between elements in the sorted list `diff`, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0. Since `j` needs to be increased by 1 for the loop to execute again, the next iteration would require `j` to be incremented by 1.
State: **`left` is updated based on the absolute differences between elements in the sorted list `diff` from index `i` to `j`, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be increased by 2**
