Example Answer:
The `left` variable is updated by adding the absolute difference between the elements in the sorted list `diff` at indices `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` are known (i=0, N>0) but the values of `left` and `diff` are not specified. Therefore, the updated `left` value is dependent on the specific values of `diff[i]` and `diff[j]`. The states of `right` and `m` are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`left` is updated based on the absolute differences between elements in the sorted list `diff` from index `i` to `j`, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be increased by 1**
