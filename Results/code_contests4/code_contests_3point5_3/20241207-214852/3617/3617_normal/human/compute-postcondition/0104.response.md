According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N` and `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `N` needs to be greater than the current value of `N`.
State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end excluding the first element, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than `N`**
