According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a list with at least `N+3` elements, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `N`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` starting from index `i + 1`, and a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of `left` and `right`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` should have at least `N+4` elements.
State: **`m` is a list with at least `N+4` elements, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `N`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` starting from index `i + 1` and a new element is appended to `m` which is the sum of `left` and `right`**
