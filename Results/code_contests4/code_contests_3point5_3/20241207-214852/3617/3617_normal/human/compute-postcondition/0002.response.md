Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of `line`. The value of `line` is taken from the standard input, so it depends on the input provided. After execution, `N` will hold the integer value of `line`. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is assigned the value of the input read from the standard input, `N` is an integer value.
Output State: **`line` is assigned the value of the input read from the standard input, `N` is an integer value**
