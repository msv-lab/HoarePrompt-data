According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+2`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `N+1`.
State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end, `right` is updated, `m` is appended with the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `N+1`**
