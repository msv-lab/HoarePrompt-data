Example Answer:
The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the list `diff`. The loop will execute as long as `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is greater than 1. The previous values of `left`, `N`, and `i` are unknown, and the list `diff` is not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list with at least `N` elements, `i` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute the next time `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the list `diff.
Output State: **`m` is a list with at least `N` elements, `i` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute the next time `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the list `diff**
