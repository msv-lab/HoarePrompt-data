According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `N` is at least equal to `i+1`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `right` is 0, `j` is equal to `i + 1, and `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`.
State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff` from index 1 to the end, `right` is 0, `j` is equal to `i + 1, `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to `i+1` for the loop to execute the first time**
