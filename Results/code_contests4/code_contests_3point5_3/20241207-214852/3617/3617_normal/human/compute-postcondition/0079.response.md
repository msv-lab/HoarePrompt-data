Example Answer:
`right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, where `j` is `i+1`. The variables `left` and `N` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is `i+1`, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than `i+1`.
Output State: **`left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the sorted list `diff`, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is `i+1`, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than `i+1**.
