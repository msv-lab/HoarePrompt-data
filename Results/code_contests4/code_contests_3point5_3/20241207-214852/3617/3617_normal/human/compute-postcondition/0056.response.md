According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `N`, and `j`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `N` is greater than `i + 1, and `j` is `i + 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all combinations of elements in `diff`, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `N` is greater than `i + 1, `j` is `i + 3**
