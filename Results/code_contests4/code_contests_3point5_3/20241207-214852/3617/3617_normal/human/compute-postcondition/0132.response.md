According to the code, the loop will only execute if `i` is greater than 0. However, the loop range starts from 0, so `i` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`m` is a list with at least `N` elements, `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, `left` is 0**
