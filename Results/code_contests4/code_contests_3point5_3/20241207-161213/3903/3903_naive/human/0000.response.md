Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. It iterates over all possible start and end indices for flipping the values, but it does not consider that only one move is allowed. This means that it might flip the values multiple times, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 0 0 1
```
The program outputs `4`, but the correct output should be `4` as flipping the second and third elements will result in all ones. This shows that the program does not adhere to the constraints of the problem description.
