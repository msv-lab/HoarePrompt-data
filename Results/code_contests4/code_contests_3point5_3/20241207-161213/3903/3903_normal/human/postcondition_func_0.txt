The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, representing the number of integers in the input sequence. The input sequence consists of `n` integers, each being either 0 or 1. The function then processes the input sequence by toggling elements and calculating the maximum sum of 1s in the list `a`. Finally, it prints out the maximum count of 1s after toggling elements. The function does not explicitly return a value.
