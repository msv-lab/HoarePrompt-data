You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Iahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper. 

He writes n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and flips all values ak for which their positions are in range [i, j] (that is i ≤ k ≤ j). Flip the value of x means to apply operation x = 1 - x.

The goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). In the second line of the input there are n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. It is guaranteed that each of those n values is either 0 or 1.

Output

Print an integer — the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move. 

Examples

Input

5
1 0 0 1 0


Output

4


Input

4
1 0 0 1


Output

4

Note

In the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 5 (i = 2, j = 5). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1].

In the second case, flipping only the second and the third element (i = 2, j = 3) will turn all numbers into 1.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. The input sequence consists of n integers, each being either 0 or 1.**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    maximum_count = 0
    for start in range(0, n):
        for end in range(0, n):
            if start <= end:
                b = list(a)
                for i in range(start, end + 1):
                    b[i] = 1 - b[i]
                count = sum(b)
                maximum_count = max(maximum_count, count)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is equal to `n-1`, `end` is equal to `n-1`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`
    print(maximum_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, representing the number of integers in the input sequence. The input sequence consists of `n` integers, each being either 0 or 1. The function then processes the input sequence by toggling elements and calculating the maximum sum of 1s in the list `a`. Finally, it prints out the maximum count of 1s after toggling elements. The function does not explicitly return a value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
