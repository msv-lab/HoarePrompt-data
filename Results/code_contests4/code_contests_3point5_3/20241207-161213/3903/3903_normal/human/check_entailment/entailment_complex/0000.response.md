Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It reads an integer `n` and a sequence of integers consisting of 0s and 1s. It then iterates through all possible pairs of indices, toggles the elements within that range, calculates the sum of 1s in the modified list, and keeps track of the maximum count. Finally, it prints the maximum count of 1s achievable after exactly one move, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description.
