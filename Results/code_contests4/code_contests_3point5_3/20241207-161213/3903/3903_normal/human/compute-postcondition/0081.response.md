According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `start` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is equal to `n-1`, which means `n` elements have been iterated through. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `start` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next element.
State: **`end` is equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n` needs to be incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`**
