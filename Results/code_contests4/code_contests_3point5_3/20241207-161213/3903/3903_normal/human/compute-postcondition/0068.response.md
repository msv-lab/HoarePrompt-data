According to the code, the loop will execute for the next iteration if `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`end` is equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b**`.
