Postcondition: ***`end` is equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `a` is not empty, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a copy of `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is updated to the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum between the previous maximum_count and count.***
