Output State: `end` is 2, `i` is equal to `start` + 2, `start` is less than or equal to `n`, `end` is greater than or equal to `start`, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b. The value at index `i` in list `b` is toggled by subtracting the value at index `i` from 1.
