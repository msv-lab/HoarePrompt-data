Example Answer:
`maximum_count` is initialized to 0. The state of the list `a` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is 0**
