Example Answer:
`count` is assigned the sum of all elements in list `b`, where each element is toggled from the corresponding element in list `a`. The sum is the total count of 1s in list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than `end`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than `end`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`**
