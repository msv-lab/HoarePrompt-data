Output State: `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is further incremented by 1, `end` may be further incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers where the value at index `start` has been toggled, for the loop to execute one more time `start` must be less than or equal to `end` and `b[i]` has been toggled to `1 - b[i]`.
