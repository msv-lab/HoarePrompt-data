Output State: **`end` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented by 1, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute properly `start + 1` is less than or equal to `end`, `i` is equal to `start + 2, `b[i]` is toggled to 1 or 0 based on its current value**
