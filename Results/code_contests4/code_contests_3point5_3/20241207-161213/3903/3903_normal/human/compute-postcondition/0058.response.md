According to the code, the loop will execute for each `i` in the range from `start` to `end` inclusive. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. `end` should be at least equal to `start`.
2. The list `a` should not be empty.
3. `maximum_count` should be updated based on the current `maximum_count` and `count`.
4. `n` should be greater than 0.
5. `start` should be less than `n`.
6. The list `b` should be a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled.
7. `count` should be updated as the sum of 1s in list `b`.

State: **`end` is at least equal to `start`, `a` is not empty, `maximum_count` is updated, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a copy of `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is updated**.
