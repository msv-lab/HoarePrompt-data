According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `end` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, the key variables that need to be adjusted are `end`, `a`, `maximum_count`, `start`, `b`, and `count` to ensure that the loop can execute properly. 

State: **`end` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented by 1, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute properly**
