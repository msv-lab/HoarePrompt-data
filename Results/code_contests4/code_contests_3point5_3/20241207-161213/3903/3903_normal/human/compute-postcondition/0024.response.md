Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in list `b` is toggled to its opposite value (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). This operation does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of 1s in list `a`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of 1s in list `a`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `start` is less than or equal to `end`**
