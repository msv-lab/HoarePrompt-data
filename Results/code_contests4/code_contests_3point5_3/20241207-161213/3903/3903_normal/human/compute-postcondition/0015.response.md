Example Answer:
The `maximum_count` is assigned the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and the sum of 1s in list `b` represented by `count`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and sum of 1s in list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than `end`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and sum of 1s in list `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than `end`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`**
