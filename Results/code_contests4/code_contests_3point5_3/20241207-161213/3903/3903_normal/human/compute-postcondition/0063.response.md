Example Answer: 
The value of `b[i]` is toggled by subtracting the current value from 1. Since `b` is a copy of `a` with all elements toggled, the value of `b[i]` will change accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`end` is at least equal to `start`, `a` is not empty, `maximum_count` is updated, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a copy of `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is updated, for the loop to execute one more time `end` should be greater than or equal to `start` and `start` should be less than `n`**
