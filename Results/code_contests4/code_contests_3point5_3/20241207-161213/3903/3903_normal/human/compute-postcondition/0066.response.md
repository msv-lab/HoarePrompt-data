Example Answer:
The value of `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `end` is at least equal to `start`, `a` is not empty, `maximum_count` is updated, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a copy of `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is updated, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is the maximum between the previous maximum_count and count.
Output State: **`end` is at least equal to `start`, `a` is not empty, `maximum_count` is updated, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a copy of `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is updated, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is the maximum between the previous maximum_count and count**
