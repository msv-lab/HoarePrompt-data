Example Answer: 
The list `b` is assigned a copy of list `a`, so the values of `a` and `b` are the same. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a`**
