Example Answer:
`maximum_count` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and the sum of 1s in list `a`. The values of `a`, `n`, `start`, `end`, `b`, and `count` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `a` will be a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` will be the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and the sum of 1s in list `a`, `n` will still be greater than 0, `start` will remain less than or equal to `end + 1`, `b` will be a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and will be a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` will be the sum of 1s in list `a`. `count` will be assigned the sum of integers in list `b`.
