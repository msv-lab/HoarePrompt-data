Output State: **`end` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented by 4, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, where `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`.**
