Output State: **`end` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented by 2, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute a second time `start` is less than or equal to `end + 2**
