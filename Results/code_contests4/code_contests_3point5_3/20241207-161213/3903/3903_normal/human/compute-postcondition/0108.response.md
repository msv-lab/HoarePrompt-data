Example Answer:
The list `b` is created as a copy of list `a`. The contents of list `a` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `end` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented by 2, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`.
Output State: **`end` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented by 2, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`**
