The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of integers in the input sequence. The input sequence consists of `n` integers, each being either 0 or 1. The functionality of the function is to read the input sequence and process it accordingly, without explicitly returning a value.
