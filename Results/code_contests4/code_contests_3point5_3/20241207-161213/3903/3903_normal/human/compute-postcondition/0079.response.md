Postcondition: ***`end` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than or equal to `n`, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b. All elements in list `b` will be toggled after the loop finishes executing, `count` is the sum of `b`, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`.***
