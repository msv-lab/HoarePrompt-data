Postcondition: ***`end` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`. The program updates `maximum_count` based on the sum of 1s in list `b` after toggling elements, ensuring `end` remains 0, and `start` is less than `n` for the loop to execute.***
