Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input sequence of integers to a list. Each integer is converted to its integer form. Since the input sequence consists of n integers, each being either 0 or 1, after execution, variable `a` will be a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
