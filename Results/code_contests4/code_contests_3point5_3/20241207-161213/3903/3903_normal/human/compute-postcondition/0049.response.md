Output State: **`end` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value of the sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is 1, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with the `i`-th element toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute the second time `end` is 0, `start` is 1**
