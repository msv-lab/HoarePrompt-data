According to the code, in order for the loop to execute, the variables `i`, `start`, and `end` need to be properly set. The loop will execute if `start` is less than or equal to `n` and `end` is greater than or equal to `start`. Before the loop starts, `end` is equal to 2, so we need to adjust the states such that `i` is equal to `start`, `start` is less than or equal to `n`, and `end` is greater than or equal to `start`.
State: **`end` is 2, `i` is equal to `start`, `start` is less than or equal to `n`, `end` is greater than or equal to `start`, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b**.
