Example Answer:
The value of `b[i]` is toggled by subtracting 1 from the current value. Since `b` is a copy of `a`, the elements in `b` are toggled accordingly. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `end` is at least equal to `start`, `a` is not empty, `maximum_count` is updated, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a copy of `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is updated.
Output State: **`end` is at least equal to `start`, `a` is not empty, `maximum_count` is updated, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a copy of `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is updated**
