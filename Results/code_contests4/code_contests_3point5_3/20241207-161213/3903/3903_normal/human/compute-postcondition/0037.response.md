Output State: **At the end of the loop, `a` will be a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` will be the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of 1s in list `a`, `n` will still be greater than 0, `start` will remain less than or equal to `end + 1`, `b` will be a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and will be a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` will be the sum of 1s in list `a`.**
