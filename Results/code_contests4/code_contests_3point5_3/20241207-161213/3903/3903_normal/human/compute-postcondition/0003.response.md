According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `maximum_count` is 0, it does not impact the execution of the loop. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `start` is 0**
