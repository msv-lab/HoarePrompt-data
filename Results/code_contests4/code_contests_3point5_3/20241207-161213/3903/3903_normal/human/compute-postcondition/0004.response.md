According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `maximum_count` is 0 and `start` is 0, which does not ensure the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `end` is 0, and the list `a` contains at least one element.
State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0**
