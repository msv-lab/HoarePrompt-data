Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in list `b` is toggled to 1 if it was 0 or to 0 if it was 1. The previous values of variables are `a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of 1s in list `a`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end + 1`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `a`, and `i` is equal to `start + 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of 1s in list `a`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end + 1`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled at index `i`, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `a`, for the loop to execute `i` is equal to `start + 2`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of 1s in list `a`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end + 1`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled at index `i`, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `a`, for the loop to execute `i` is equal to `start + 2`**
