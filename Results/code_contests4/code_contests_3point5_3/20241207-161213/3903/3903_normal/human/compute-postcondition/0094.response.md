Postcondition: ***`end` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented by 1, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute properly. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, all elements in list `b` are toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of the current `maximum_count` and `count`.***
