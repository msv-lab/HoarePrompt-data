Postcondition: ***`end` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value of the sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `end` is 0, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`***
