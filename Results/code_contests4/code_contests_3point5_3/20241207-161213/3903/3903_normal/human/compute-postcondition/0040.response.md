Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of 1s in list `a`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end + 1`, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is a copy of list `a` with values toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `a`. At the end of the loop, `count` will be assigned the sum of integers in list `b`.***
