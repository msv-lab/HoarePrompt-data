According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `start`, `start` is incremented by 1, and `end` remains the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `i` should be less than or equal to `end`.
State: **`end` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented by 1, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute properly `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `i` is equal to `start + 1**.
