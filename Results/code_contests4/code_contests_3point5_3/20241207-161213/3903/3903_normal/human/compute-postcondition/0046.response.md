According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `start` value is less than or equal to the `end` value. So, for the loop to execute the first time, the `start` value must be equal to `end`.

State: **`end` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value of the sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a`, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `end` is 0, `start` is 0**
