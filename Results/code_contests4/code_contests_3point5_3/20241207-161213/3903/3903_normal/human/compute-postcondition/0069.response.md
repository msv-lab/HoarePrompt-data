Example Answer:
`b` is assigned a copy of list `a`. The values of `end`, `maximum_count`, `n`, `start`, `count` remain the same as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `end` is equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b.
Output State: **`end` is equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `start` is less than `n`, `b` is a list of integers which is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `b**
