Example Answer:
The value of `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `end` is greater than or equal to `start`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `maximum_count` is updated, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`end` is greater than or equal to `start`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `maximum_count` is updated, `count` is the sum of 1s in list `a` after toggling elements, `n` is greater than 0**
