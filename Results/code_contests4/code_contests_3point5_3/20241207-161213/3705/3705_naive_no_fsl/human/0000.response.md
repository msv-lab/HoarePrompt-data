Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the sum of numbers within the range [l, r] as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` does not follow the pattern of alternating between odd and even numbers and does not handle the doubling of numbers correctly. Additionally, the formula for calculating the sum is incorrect.

For example, if we take the input as (5, 14), the expected output should be 105 according to the problem description. However, the program will not produce the correct result for this input.
