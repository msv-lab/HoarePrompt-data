Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is incorrect and does not produce the correct output for all possible inputs. For example, if we take the input (5, 14), the expected output is 105, but the program will not produce the correct result for this input. This is because the logic in the program to calculate the sum of numbers from l to r based on the given set of numbers is flawed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
