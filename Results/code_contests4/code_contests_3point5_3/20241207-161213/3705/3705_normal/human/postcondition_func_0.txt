The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. If n is equal to 0, the function returns 0. For n greater than 0, the function calculates the sum of all even increments of `p` stored in `f` and the sum of all odd increments of `p` stored in `s`. The function then returns the result of the expression f * f + s * (s + 1). The code does not handle cases where n is negative or the value of `n` exceeds 10^18.
