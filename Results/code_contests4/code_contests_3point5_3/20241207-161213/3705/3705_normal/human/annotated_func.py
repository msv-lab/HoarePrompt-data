#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
def func_1(n):
    f = 0
    s = 0
    p = 1
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; f is 0; s is 0; p is 1. n is not equal to 0
    for i in range(100):
        if i % 2:
            s += min(p, n)
        else:
            f += min(p, n)
        
        n -= p
        
        if n <= 0:
            break
        
        p *= 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` contains the sum of all even increments of `p`, `s` contains the sum of all odd increments of `p`, `n` is less than or equal to 0
    return f * f + s * (s + 1)
    #The program returns the result of the expression f * f + s * (s + 1), where f contains the sum of all even increments of p and s contains the sum of all odd increments of p. The value of n is less than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. If n is equal to 0, the function returns 0. For n greater than 0, the function calculates the sum of all even increments of `p` stored in `f` and the sum of all odd increments of `p` stored in `s`. The function then returns the result of the expression f * f + s * (s + 1). The code does not handle cases where n is negative or the value of `n` exceeds 10^18.
