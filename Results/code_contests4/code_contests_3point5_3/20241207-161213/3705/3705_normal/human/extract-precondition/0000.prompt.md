You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Nazar, a student of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, is known for his outstanding mathematical abilities. Today a math teacher gave him a very difficult task.

Consider two infinite sets of numbers. The first set consists of odd positive numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, …), and the second set consists of even positive numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, …). At the first stage, the teacher writes the first number on the endless blackboard from the first set, in the second stage — the first two numbers from the second set, on the third stage — the next four numbers from the first set, on the fourth — the next eight numbers from the second set and so on. In other words, at each stage, starting from the second, he writes out two times more numbers than at the previous one, and also changes the set from which these numbers are written out to another. 

The ten first written numbers: 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10. Let's number the numbers written, starting with one.

The task is to find the sum of numbers with numbers from l to r for given integers l and r. The answer may be big, so you need to find the remainder of the division by 1000000007 (10^9+7).

Nazar thought about this problem for a long time, but didn't come up with a solution. Help him solve this problem.

Input

The first line contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^{18}) — the range in which you need to find the sum.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).

Note

In the first example, the answer is the sum of the first three numbers written out (1 + 2 + 4 = 7).

In the second example, the numbers with numbers from 5 to 14: 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. Their sum is 105.
