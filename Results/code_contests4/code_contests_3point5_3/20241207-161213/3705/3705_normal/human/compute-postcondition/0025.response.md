According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is multiplied by 2. If `i` is odd, `s` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n`. If `i` is even, `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. `n` is subtracted by `p`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the program will break out of the loop.

To adjust the states at the start of the next iteration:
- `p` needs to be multiplied by 2.
- Based on whether `i` is odd or even, `s` or `f` needs to be updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n`.
- `n` needs to be subtracted by `p`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`p` is multiplied by 2, `s` or `f` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n` based on the parity of `i`, `n` is subtracted by `p`, if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute**
