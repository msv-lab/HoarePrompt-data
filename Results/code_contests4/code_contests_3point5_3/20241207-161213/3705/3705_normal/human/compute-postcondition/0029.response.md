Output State: **`p` is multiplied by 2, `s` or `f` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n` based on the parity of `i`, `n` is subtracted by `p`, and the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. If the condition i % 2 is true, the loop will execute as described. Otherwise, `f` is added with the minimum value between `p` and `n` and the loop will not execute.**
