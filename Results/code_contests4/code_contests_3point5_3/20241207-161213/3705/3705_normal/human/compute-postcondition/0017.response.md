According to the code, the loop will execute 100 times. At the end of the previous iteration, variable `p` is multiplied by 2. To execute the loop one more time, the state of variable `p` needs to be adjusted. Since `p` was multiplied by 2 in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `p` should be multiplied by 2 again.
State: **variable `p` is multiplied by 2**.
