Example Answer:
`f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. The previous value of `p` is unknown, and `n` is also unknown. Therefore, the output state is: variable `p` is multiplied by 2; `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`.
Output State: **variable `p` is multiplied by 2; `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`**
