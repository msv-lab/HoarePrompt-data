Postcondition: ***`p` is multiplied by 2. If `i` is odd, `s` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n`. If `i` is even, `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. `n` is subtracted by `p`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
