The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. If the value of `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0. 

If the value of `n` is greater than 0, the function calculates the sum of all even increments of `p` and the sum of all odd increments of `p`, denoted as `f` and `s` respectively. The function then returns the result of the expression f * f + s * (s + 1). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified constraints and return either 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 0, or the calculated expression based on the sums of even and odd increments of `p` if `n` is greater than 0.
