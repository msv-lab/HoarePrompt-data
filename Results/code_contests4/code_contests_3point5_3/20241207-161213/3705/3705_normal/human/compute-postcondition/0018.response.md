Example Answer: 
The value of `p` is multiplied by 2, and then the minimum value between `p` and `n` is added to `s`. The value of `p` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `p` is multiplied by 2, and `s` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n`.
Output State: **variable `p` is multiplied by 2, `s` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n`**
