Example Answer:
`s` is updated by adding the minimum value between `p` and `n`. The value of `s` depends on the parity of `i` and the values of `p` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0. The value of `n` is decreased by the value of `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is multiplied by 2, `s` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n` based on the parity of `i`, `n` is subtracted by `p`, and the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`p` is multiplied by 2, `s` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n` based on the parity of `i`, `n` is subtracted by `p`, and the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0**
