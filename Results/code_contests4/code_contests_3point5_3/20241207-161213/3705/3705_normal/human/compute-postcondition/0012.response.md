Example Answer:
The value of n is decreased by the value of p. Depending on the value of n % 2, either f or s will be updated accordingly. If n % 2 is true, s will be updated by adding the minimum value between p and n. If n % 2 is false, f will be updated to f + min(p, n) and s will be set to 0. 
Output State: **n is updated, f and s are adjusted based on the condition of n % 2**
