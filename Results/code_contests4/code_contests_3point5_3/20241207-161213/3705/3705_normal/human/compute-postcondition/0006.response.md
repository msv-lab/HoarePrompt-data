According to the code, the loop will execute 100 times regardless of the value of `n`. Therefore, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; f is 0; s is 0; p is 1, n is not equal to 0, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
