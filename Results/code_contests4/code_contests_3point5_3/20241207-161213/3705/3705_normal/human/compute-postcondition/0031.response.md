Postcondition: ***`p` is multiplied by 2, `s` or `f` is updated with the minimum value between `p` and `n` based on the parity of `i`. If `n` is subtracted by `p` and the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. If the condition i % 2 is true, the loop will execute as described. Otherwise, `f` is added with the minimum value between `p` and `n` and the loop will not execute. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks and the program stops executing.***
