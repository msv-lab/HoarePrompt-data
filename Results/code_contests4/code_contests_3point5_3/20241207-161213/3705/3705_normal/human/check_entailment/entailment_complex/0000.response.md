Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It calculates the sum of all even and odd increments separately, but it does not follow the correct pattern as described in the problem description. The program fails to consider the alternating sequence of numbers from the two sets and the doubling of the numbers at each stage. Therefore, the program does not provide the correct sum for the given range of numbers.

The program also does not handle cases where the value of `n` exceeds 10^18, which is a requirement specified in the problem description. Additionally, the program does not handle negative values of `n`. 

Overall, the program does not accurately solve the problem as described in the problem description.
