Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers as described in the problem statement. It iterates through a loop with 100 iterations, calculating the sum of even numbers and odd numbers separately. It then returns the sum of squares of the even sum and the sum of the odd sum, which represents the required sum of numbers within the given range.

The program ensures that it considers both even and odd numbers in the correct order and calculates the sum within the specified range. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
