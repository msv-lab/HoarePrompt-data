Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The program should output the minimum number of people Vasya needs to check to ensure that there are no clients under 18 having alcohol drinks. However, the program simply counts the occurrences of people under 18 and those having alcohol drinks without considering the minimum number needed to be checked.

Additionally, there is a typo in the program where 'WISKEY' should be 'WHISKEY', which may lead to incorrect counting.

Therefore, the program does not guarantee the correct output as required by the problem description.
