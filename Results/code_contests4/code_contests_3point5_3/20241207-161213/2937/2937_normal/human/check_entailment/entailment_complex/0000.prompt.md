You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: According to Berland laws it is only allowed to sell alcohol to people not younger than 18 years. Vasya's job is to monitor the law's enforcement. Tonight he entered a bar and saw n people sitting there. For every one of them Vasya happened to determine either the age or the drink the person is having. Vasya can check any person, i.e. learn his age and the drink he is having at the same time. What minimal number of people should Vasya check additionally to make sure that there are no clients under 18 having alcohol drinks?

The list of all alcohol drinks in Berland is: ABSINTH, BEER, BRANDY, CHAMPAGNE, GIN, RUM, SAKE, TEQUILA, VODKA, WHISKEY, WINE

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) which is the number of the bar's clients. Then follow n lines, each describing one visitor. A line either contains his age (an integer from 0 to 1000) or his drink (a string of capital Latin letters from 1 to 100 in length). It is guaranteed that the input data does not contain spaces and other unnecessary separators.

Only the drinks from the list given above should be considered alcohol.

Output

Print a single number which is the number of people Vasya should check to guarantee the law enforcement.

Examples

Input

5
18
VODKA
COKE
19
17


Output

2

Note

In the sample test the second and fifth clients should be checked.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.**
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    res = 0
    for rep in range(n):
        inp = raw_input()
        
        if inp[0] >= '0' and inp[0] <= '9':
            if int(inp) < 18:
                res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'ABSINTH':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'BEER':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'BRANDY':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'CHAMPAGNE':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'GIN':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'RUM':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'SAKE':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'TEQUILA':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'VODKA':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'WISKEY':
            res = res + 1
        elif inp == 'WINE':
            res = res + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `res` is an integer. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `res` will be the total number of occurrences where the conditions are met in the loop for all inputs provided.
    print(res)
    exit(0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, then reads `n` strings and counts the occurrences of specific strings meeting certain conditions. It then prints the total count of occurrences. The function does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
