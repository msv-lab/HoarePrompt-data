Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. 
1. There is a typo in the program where 'WISKEY' should be 'WHISKEY'.
2. The program does not handle the case where a client's age is not provided before mentioning their drink. This means that the program may not correctly identify clients under 18 who are having alcohol drinks. 
3. The program does not account for cases where there are clients with drinks that are not in the list of alcohol drinks but are still under 18.

Therefore, the program does not always guarantee the correct enforcement of the law as described in the problem statement.
