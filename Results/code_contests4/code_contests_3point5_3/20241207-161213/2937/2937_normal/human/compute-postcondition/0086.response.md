Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so after execution, `res` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` is adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` is adjusted accordingly**
