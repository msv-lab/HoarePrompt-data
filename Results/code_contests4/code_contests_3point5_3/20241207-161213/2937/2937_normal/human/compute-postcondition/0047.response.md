Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, res is 1, for the loop to execute the first time n is greater than 0, rep is 0. The first element of `inp` is not a digit from 0 to 9. `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH'. `inp` is not equal to 'BEER'. `inp` is not equal to 'BRANDY'. `inp` is not equal to 'CHAMPAGNE'. If `inp` is equal to 'GIN', then res is 1. If `inp` is equal to 'RUM', then res is 1. If `inp` is equal to 'SAKE', then res is 1. If `inp` is not equal to 'SAKE' and `inp` is equal to 'TEQUILA', then res is 1, rep is 0. If `inp` is not equal to 'SAKE' and `inp` is not equal to 'TEQUILA', then `inp` is either 'WISKEY' or 'WINE', res is 1, rep is 0.***
