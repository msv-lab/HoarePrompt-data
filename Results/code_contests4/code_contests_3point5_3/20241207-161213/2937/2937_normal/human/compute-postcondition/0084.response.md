Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is within the range 1 to 100, and `inp` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so it does not affect the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` is adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` is adjusted accordingly**
