Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, res is 1, for the loop to execute the first time n is greater than 0, rep is 0. The first element of inp is not a digit from 0 to 9. If inp is 'ABSINTH', then res is 1. If inp is 'BEER', then res is 1. If inp is 'BRANDY', 'GIN', 'RUM', or 'SAKE', then res is 1. If inp is 'TEQUILA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then res is 1 and rep is 0.
