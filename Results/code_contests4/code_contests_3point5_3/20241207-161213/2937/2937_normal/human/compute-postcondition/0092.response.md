Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1 after executing the code. The value of `res` is not provided in the initial state, so the new value of `res` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` is incremented by 1, and `rep` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` is unchanged**
