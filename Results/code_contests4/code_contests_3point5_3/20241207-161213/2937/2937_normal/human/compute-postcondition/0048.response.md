Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, res is 1, for the loop to execute the first time n is greater than 0, rep is 0. The first element of `inp` is not a digit from 0 to 9. `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH'. `inp` is not equal to 'BEER'. `inp` is not equal to 'BRANDY'. The value of `inp` can be 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE'. If `inp` is 'GIN', 'RUM', or 'SAKE', then res is 1. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', then res is 1 and rep is 0. If `inp` is 'WISKEY' or 'WINE', then res is 1 and rep is 0.***
