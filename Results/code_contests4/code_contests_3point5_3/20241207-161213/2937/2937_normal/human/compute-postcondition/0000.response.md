Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can range from 1 to 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100**
