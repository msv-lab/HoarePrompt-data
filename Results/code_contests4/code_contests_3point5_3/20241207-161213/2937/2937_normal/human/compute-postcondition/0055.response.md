Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` is not affected.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` is not affected**
