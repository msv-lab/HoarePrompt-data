Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so after execution, `res` will be incremented by 1. The variable `rep` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` remains unchanged**
