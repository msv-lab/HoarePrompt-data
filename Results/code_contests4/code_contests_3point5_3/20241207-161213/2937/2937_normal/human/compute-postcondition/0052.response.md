Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, res is an integer. For the loop to execute the first time, n is greater than 0, rep is 0, and inp is a string. If the first character of inp is a digit between 0 and 9 and the integer value of inp is less than 18, then res is incremented by 1. If the first character of inp is not a digit from 0 to 9, and inp is 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'GIN', 'RUM', or 'SAKE', then res is 1. If inp is 'TEQUILA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then res is 1 and rep is 0. If inp is 'CHAMPAGNE', then res is 0. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
