Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` remains unchanged. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` remains unchanged. If `inp` is 'WINE', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` is adjusted accordingly based on the conditions.***
