According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `res` is 0 does not play a role in determining if the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0 and `rep` is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `res` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `rep` is 0**
