Example Answer:
inp is assigned the value of raw_input(), which takes input from the user. The variables n, res, and rep remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, res is 0, for the loop to execute the first time n is greater than 0, rep is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, res is 0, for the loop to execute the first time n is greater than 0, rep is 0**
