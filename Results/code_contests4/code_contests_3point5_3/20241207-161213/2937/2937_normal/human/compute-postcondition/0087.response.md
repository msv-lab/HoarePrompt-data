Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `res` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` and `rep` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions, and `res` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` and `rep` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions, `res` is incremented by 1**
