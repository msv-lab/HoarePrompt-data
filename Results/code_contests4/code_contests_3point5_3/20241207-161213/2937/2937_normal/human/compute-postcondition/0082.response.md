Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the new value of `res` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `inp`, and `rep` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` has been incremented by 1, `rep` is adjusted accordingly based on the conditions.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `inp` is a value that determines whether `res` should be incremented, `res` has been incremented by 1, `rep` is adjusted accordingly based on the conditions**
