Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` remains unchanged**
