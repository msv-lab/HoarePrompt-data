#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.**
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    count = n
    while n != 1:
        for i in range(2, n):
            if divmod(n, i)[1] == 0:
                break

            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a prime number, `count` is the sum of all the values of `n` in the loop, `b` is 1 if `n` is a prime number, `i` is 2
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the sum of `n` and its divisors in a specific loop structure, and prints the final sum `count`. However, the code does not follow the annotations as it does not check if `n` is in the specified range of 2 to 10^9, and it does not handle any input validation or error cases. Additionally, the code does not account for the case when `n` is not a prime number, which might lead to unexpected results.
