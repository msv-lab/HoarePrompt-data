Output State: **`n` is updated based on the initial values of `n` and `b`, `count` is increased, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 2. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the remainder of the division of `n` by 2 is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
