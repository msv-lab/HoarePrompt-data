According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `b`, `count`, `i` are integers. If divmod(n, i)[1] == 0, then `n`, `b`, `count`, `i` remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, then there is no change in the variables. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `b`, `count`, `i+1` are integers**
