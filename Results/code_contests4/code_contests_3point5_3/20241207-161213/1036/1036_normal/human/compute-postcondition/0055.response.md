Postcondition: ***`b`, `count`, `n` are integers. If `b` is equal to 1, then `b` is assigned the value of `n // i`, `count` is increased by `n // i`, `n` is updated by subtracting `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `b`, `count`, and `n`.***
