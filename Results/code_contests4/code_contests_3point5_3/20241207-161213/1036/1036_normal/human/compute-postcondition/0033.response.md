Example Answer:
The value of `count` is increased by the value of `b`. Since `count` is at least 5 and `b` is greater than 1, the new value of `count` will be greater than the previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-prime number, `count` is increased, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a non-prime number, `count` is increased, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
