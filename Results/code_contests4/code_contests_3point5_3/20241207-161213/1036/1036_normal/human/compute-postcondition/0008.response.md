Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, `count` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 2 and the remainder of the division of `n` by the next value of `i` in the range should not be 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
