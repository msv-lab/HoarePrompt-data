Output State: **`n` is a non-prime number, `count` is at least 5, `b` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 2. When the condition `(divmod(n, i)[1] == 0)` is satisfied, it means that `n` is divisible by `i` without remainder. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
