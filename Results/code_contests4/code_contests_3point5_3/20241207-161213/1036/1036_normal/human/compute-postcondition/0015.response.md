Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `b`, which is 1. Since `count` is initially equal to `n`, which is a prime number, and `b` is 1, after execution, `count` will be `n + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a prime number, `count` is `n + 1`, `b` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a prime number, `count` is `n + 1`, `b` is 1**
