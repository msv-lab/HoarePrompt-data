According to the code, the loop executes for the range starting from 2 up to n. If the remainder of the division of n by i is 0, the loop breaks. At the end of the last iteration, n is such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, count is equal to n. For the loop to execute one more time, n must be greater than 2 and the remainder of the division of n by the next value of i in the range should not be 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, `count` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 2 and the remainder of the division of `n` by the next value of `i` in the range should not be 0**
