Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decreased by the value of `b`, which is 1. Since `n` is a prime number, subtracting 1 will result in a non-prime number. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-prime number, `count` is `n + 1`, `b` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-prime number, `count` is `n + 1`, `b` is 1**
