Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully follow the problem description. It does not handle the case when `n` is not a prime number, which is a requirement in the problem description. The program should calculate the maximum possible result of the game for any given initial number of pebbles `n`, but it only works correctly for prime numbers.
Additionally, the program does not check if the input `n` is within the specified range of 2 to 10^9 as stated in the problem description. This lack of input validation could lead to unexpected results for input values outside of the specified range.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
