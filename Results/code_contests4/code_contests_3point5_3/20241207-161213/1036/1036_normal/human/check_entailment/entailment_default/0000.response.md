Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the sum of `n` and its divisors in a specific loop structure, and prints the final sum `count`.
- The program follows the problem description as it correctly implements the game process where the Smart Beaver arranges pebbles in equal rows, takes back one row, and continues the process until there is only one pebble left.
- The code handles the scenario where `n` is not a prime number by identifying and considering divisors of `n` when calculating the maximum possible result of the game.
- The code ensures that the game ends when there is only one pebble left, as required by the problem description.
