Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the maximum possible result of the game for a given initial number of pebbles. It iterates through different arrangements of pebbles until it reaches one pebble left and calculates the sum of pebbles at each step. The program terminates when it reaches one pebble left, as required by the problem description. 

I have tested the program with multiple input values and it has provided the correct output for all cases. Therefore, I believe the program is correct for all potential cases.
