Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes three integers as input, sorts them in descending order, calculates the maximum possible amount of the allowance according to the given formula, and then prints the result. 
For all possible inputs within the constraints (1 <= A, B, C <= 9), the program correctly calculates the maximum allowance amount by sorting the integers in descending order and applying the formula. 
Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
