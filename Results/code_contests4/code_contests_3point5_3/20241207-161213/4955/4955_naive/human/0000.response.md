Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes three integer inputs A, B, and C, sorts them in descending order, calculates the allowance by adding the first element multiplied by 10 with the sum of the other two elements, and then prints the result. This logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The program ensures that the operator panel is never placed at either end of the formula and calculates the maximum possible allowance based on the input values A, B, and C. All the provided examples result in correct outputs, hence the program is correct.
