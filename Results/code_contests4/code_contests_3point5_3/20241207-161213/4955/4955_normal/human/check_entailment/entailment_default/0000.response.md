Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three integers as input, sorts them in descending order, converts them to integers, calculates the maximum possible allowance amount by taking the first three elements of the sorted list, and prints the result. The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It constructs the formula X + Y to maximize the allowance amount based on the given integers A, B, and C. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, confirming that it correctly calculates the maximum possible allowance amount. Therefore, the code is correct.
