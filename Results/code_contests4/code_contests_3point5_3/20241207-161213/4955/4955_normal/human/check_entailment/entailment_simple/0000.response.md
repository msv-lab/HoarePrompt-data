Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input integers A, B, and C, then sorts them in descending order. It then calculates the maximum possible amount of the allowance by following the formula X + Y = 10 * max(A, B, C) + min(A, B, C) + the remaining value. This logic correctly finds the maximum possible amount of the allowance based on the problem description for all potential cases where 1 <= A, B, C <= 9.
