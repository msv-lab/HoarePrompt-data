Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values as strings, sorts them in descending order, converts them to integers, and then calculates the maximum possible amount of the allowance as described in the problem description. The output of the program is the maximum possible amount of the allowance, which is the result of the formula X + Y, where X is the largest digit and Y is the sum of the other two digits. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
