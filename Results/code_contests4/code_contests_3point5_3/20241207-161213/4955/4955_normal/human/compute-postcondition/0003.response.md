Example Answer:
Each element in the list `lst` is converted to an integer using the `map` function and then stored back into `lst`. Since the values in `lst` are already integers and reversed sorted, the list remains the same after conversion. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and `lst` contains the reversed sorted values provided as input.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and `lst` contains the reversed sorted values provided as input**
