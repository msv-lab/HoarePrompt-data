Example Answer:
The `lst` is reversed, so the order of the sorted values in the list is reversed. The values of A, B, and C remain the same as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and `lst` contains the reversed sorted values provided as input.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and `lst` contains the reversed sorted values provided as input**
