Example Answer:
The list `lst` is sorted in ascending order. The values in the list are rearranged accordingly. The variables A, B, and C are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and `lst` contains the sorted values provided as input.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and `lst` contains the sorted values provided as input.**
