Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of 10 times the first element of `lst` plus the sum of the second and third elements of `lst`. The elements of `lst` are reversed and sorted, so the first element is the largest and the third element is the smallest. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will be the number formed by concatenating the largest, second largest, and smallest elements of `lst` in that order.
Output State: **`ans` is the number formed by concatenating the largest, second largest, and smallest elements of `lst` in that order**
