Example Answer:
`lst` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` accepts input as a string and `split()` splits the string into a list. Since the initial state does not mention any specific values for A, B, and C, we cannot determine the exact values in the list after splitting. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and `lst` contains the values provided as input.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and `lst` contains the values provided as input.**
