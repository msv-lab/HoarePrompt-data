Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the given problem description. The program only defines a function `func_1` that calculates the distance between two pieces of meat based on their coordinates, but it does not implement the main algorithm described in the problem.

To solve the problem, the program should calculate the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready by putting the heat source at different coordinates and minimizing the time. This involves iterating through all possible coordinates to find the minimum time. The program should also consider the hardness of each piece of meat in the calculation.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect as it does not implement the required algorithm to solve the problem.
