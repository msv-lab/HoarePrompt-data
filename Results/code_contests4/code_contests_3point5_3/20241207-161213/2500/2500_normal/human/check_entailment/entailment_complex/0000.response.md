Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not include the main function that should solve the problem described in the problem description. It only includes a function `func_1` that calculates the distance between two pieces of meat based on their coordinates. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
