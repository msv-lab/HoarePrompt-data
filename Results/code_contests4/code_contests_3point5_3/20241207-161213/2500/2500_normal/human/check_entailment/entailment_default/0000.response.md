Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not entirely follow the problem description. The program is missing the consideration of the case when the heat source is placed at a coordinate (X, Y) such that all pieces of meat are ready to eat in K or more pieces of meat ready. The code may terminate the while loop without checking this condition, leading to a potential incorrect output. This edge case needs to be handled to ensure the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
