**Input**

- N: an integer representing the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60)
- K: an integer representing the number of pieces of meat Takahashi wants to eat (1 <= K <= N)
- (x_i, y_i, c_i): N sets of integers representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, 1 <= c_i <= 100)

**Output**

- The time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if Takahashi put the heat source to minimize this time, with an absolute or relative error at most 10^-6.
