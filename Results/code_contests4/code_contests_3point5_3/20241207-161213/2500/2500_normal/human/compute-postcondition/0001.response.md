The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `i` and `j`, which represent the indices of two pieces of meat. After executing the function body, the function returns the distance between the pieces of meat `i` and `j` based on their coordinates `X[i]`, `Y[i]`, `X[j]`, `Y[j]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two indices representing pieces of meat and calculate the distance between them based on their coordinates.
Functionality: **The function accepts two indices i and j representing pieces of meat and returns the distance between them based on their coordinates.**
