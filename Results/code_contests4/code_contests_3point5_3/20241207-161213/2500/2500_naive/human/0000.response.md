Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code provided does not accurately calculate the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready with the heat source placed at coordinates (X, Y) to minimize the time. The implementation of the binary search algorithm in the code is flawed and does not provide the correct output for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed false as it fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all cases.
