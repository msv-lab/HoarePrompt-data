Example Answer:
`z.parent` is assigned the value `y`, where `y` is an instance of Node. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node (can be `None` or another type depending on the last comparison with `z.key`), `z.parent` is assigned the instance `y`.**
