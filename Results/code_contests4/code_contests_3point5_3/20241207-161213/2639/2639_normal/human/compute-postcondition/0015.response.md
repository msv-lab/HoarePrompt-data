Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `x`, and `x` is an instance of Node. Therefore, after execution, `y` becomes an instance of Node as well. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is an instance of Node**
