The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `top` and `z`. `top` is the root node of the binary search tree T, and `z` is a non-negative integer representing the number of print operations. The function returns the root node of the binary search tree T. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the root node of a binary search tree and the number of print operations, and return the root node of the binary search tree T.
