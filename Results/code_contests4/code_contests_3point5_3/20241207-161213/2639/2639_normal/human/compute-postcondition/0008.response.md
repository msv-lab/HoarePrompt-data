Functionality: **The function func_4 accepts a parameter `node` which represents a node in a tree data structure. The function recursively traverses the tree starting from the given node and prints the key value of each node. It first prints the key of the current node, then recursively calls itself on the left child node if it exists, and then on the right child node if it exists. The function operates within the constraints of the key value being within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000.**
