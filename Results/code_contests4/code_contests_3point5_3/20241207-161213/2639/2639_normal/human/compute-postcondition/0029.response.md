Postcondition: ***`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the instance `y`. If `y` is None, then `top` is assigned the value of `z`. If `y` is not None and `z.key < y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the instance `z`. If `y` is not None and `z.key` is not less than `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the instance `z`.***
