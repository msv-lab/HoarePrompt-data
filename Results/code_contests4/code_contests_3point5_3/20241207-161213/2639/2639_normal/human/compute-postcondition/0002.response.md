Example Answer:
The function `func_4` is called with the argument `node.left`. The impact of this function call on the program depends on the implementation of `func_4` and how it modifies the state of the variables. Without additional information about the function `func_4` and its behavior, we cannot determine the exact output state.
Output State: **Depends on the implementation of func_4 and its effect on the program state**
