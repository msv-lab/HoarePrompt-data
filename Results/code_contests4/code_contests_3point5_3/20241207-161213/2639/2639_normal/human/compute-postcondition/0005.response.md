Example Answer: 
Assuming that the implementation of func_4 affects the program state when node.left is evaluated. The code snippet provided only calls func_4 with node.right which means that node.right will be processed by func_4 but node.left will not be affected directly. Therefore, the Output State is dependent on the implementation of func_4 and the impact it has on the program state.
Output State: **Dependent on the implementation of func_4 and its effect on the program state**
