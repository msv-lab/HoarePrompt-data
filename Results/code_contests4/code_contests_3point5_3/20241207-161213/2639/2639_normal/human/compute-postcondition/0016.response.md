Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value of `x.left`, which means `x` now refers to the left child of the node it was previously pointing to. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is an instance of Node pointing to its left child.
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is an instance of Node pointing to its left child**
