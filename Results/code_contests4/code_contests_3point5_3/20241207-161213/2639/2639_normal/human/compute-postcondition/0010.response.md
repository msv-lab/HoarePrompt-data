The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`. `node` represents a node in a tree structure, and `key` is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The function has multiple return points based on different cases:

Case 1: If the node is empty and no operations have been performed, the program returns False.
Case 2: If the key specified in the if condition is equal to the key of the node, the program returns True; otherwise, it does not return anything.
Case 3: The program returns the result of calling the function `func_2` with the left child of the node and the key as parameters.
Case 4: The program returns the result of calling the function `func_2` with the right child of the node and the key as parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a node and a key, and based on the different cases, return False, True, or the result of recursively calling the function with the left or right child of the node.
