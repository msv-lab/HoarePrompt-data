The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `node`. The parameter constraints are that `m` is a positive integer and each operation is represented by insert k, find k, or print, where the key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The function does not have a specific return value specified.
