Postcondition: ***`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is assigned the value of the root node. If `z.key` is less than `x.key`, `x` is updated to the left child of the previous `x`. If `z.key` is not less than `x.key`, `x` is updated to the right child of the previous `x`. In both cases, for the loop to execute again, `x` is adjusted based on the comparisons with `z.key`.***
