You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a program which performs the following operations to a binary search tree $T$ by adding the find operation to A: Binary Search Tree I.

* insert  $k$: Insert a node containing $k$ as key into $T$.
* find $k$: Report whether $T$ has a node containing $k$.
* print: Print the keys of the binary search tree by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk respectively.

Constraints

* The number of operations $\leq 500,000$
* The number of print operations $\leq 10$.
* $-2,000,000,000 \leq key \leq 2,000,000,000$
* The height of the binary tree does not exceed 100 if you employ the above pseudo code.
* The keys in the binary search tree are all different.

Input

In the first line, the number of operations $m$ is given. In the following $m$ lines, operations represented by insert $k$, find $k$ or print are given.

Output

For each find $k$ operation, print "yes" if $T$ has a node containing $k$, "no" if not.

In addition, for each print operation, print a list of keys obtained by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk in a line respectively. Put a space character before each key.

Example

Input

10
insert 30
insert 88
insert 12
insert 1
insert 20
find 12
insert 17
insert 25
find 16
print


Output

yes
no
 1 12 17 20 25 30 88
 30 12 1 20 17 25 88
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. top is the root node of the binary search tree T. z is an integer representing the number of print operations.**
def func_1(top, z):
    y = None
    x = top
    while isinstance(x, Node):
        y = x
        
        if z.key < x.key:
            x = x.left
        else:
            x = x.right
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node (can be `None` or another type depending on the last comparison with `z.key`).
    z.parent = y
    if (y is None) :
        top = z
    else :
        if (z.key < y.key) :
            y.left = z
        else :
            y.right = z
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the instance `y`, `y` is not None. If z.key < y.key, then `y.left` is assigned the instance `z`. If z.key is not less than y.key, then `y.right` is assigned the instance `z`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the instance `y`. If `y` is None, then `top` is assigned the value of `z`. If `y` is not None and `z.key < y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the instance `z`. If `y` is not None and `z.key` is not less than `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the instance `z`.
    return top
    #The program returns the root node of the binary search tree T

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer. Each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000.**
def func_2(node, key):
    if (not node) :
        return False
        #The program returns False since the node is empty and no operations have been performed

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. Each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The node is not empty. The node key is not equal to the key being checked in the if condition.
    if (key < node.key) :
        return func_2(node.left, key)
        #The program returns the result of calling the function func_2 with the left child of the node and the key as parameters
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. Each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The node is not empty. The node key is not equal to the key being checked in the if condition. The key is greater than or equal to the node key
    return func_2(node.right, key)
    #The program returns the result of calling function func_2 with the right child of the node and the key as parameters.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer representing the number of operations. Each operation is represented by insert k, find k, or print, where k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000.**

Furthermore, if node.left exists, there are no changes to the state of the program variables.

Furthermore, if node.left exists, there are no changes to the state of the program variables. Additionally, if node.right exists, the program continues with the specified operations as per the value of m.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer. Each operation is represented by insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000.**

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. Depending on the implementation of func_4 and its effect on the program state when node.left is evaluated, the program state will be updated accordingly.
    if node.right :
        func_4(node.right)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. The program state is updated based on the implementation of func_4 when node.right is evaluated.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
