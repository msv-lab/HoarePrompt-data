You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a program which performs the following operations to a binary search tree $T$ by adding the find operation to A: Binary Search Tree I.

* insert  $k$: Insert a node containing $k$ as key into $T$.
* find $k$: Report whether $T$ has a node containing $k$.
* print: Print the keys of the binary search tree by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk respectively.

Constraints

* The number of operations $\leq 500,000$
* The number of print operations $\leq 10$.
* $-2,000,000,000 \leq key \leq 2,000,000,000$
* The height of the binary tree does not exceed 100 if you employ the above pseudo code.
* The keys in the binary search tree are all different.

Input

In the first line, the number of operations $m$ is given. In the following $m$ lines, operations represented by insert $k$, find $k$ or print are given.

Output

For each find $k$ operation, print "yes" if $T$ has a node containing $k$, "no" if not.

In addition, for each print operation, print a list of keys obtained by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk in a line respectively. Put a space character before each key.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. top is the root node of the binary search tree T. z is an integer representing the number of print operations.**
def func_1(top, z):
    y = None
    x = top
    while isinstance(x, Node):
        y = x
        
        if z.key < x.key:
            x = x.left
        else:
            x = x.right
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node (can be `None` or another type depending on the last comparison with `z.key`).
    z.parent = y
    if (y is None) :
        top = z
    else :
        if (z.key < y.key) :
            y.left = z
        else :
            y.right = z
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the instance `y`, `y` is not None. If z.key < y.key, then `y.left` is assigned the instance `z`. If z.key is not less than y.key, then `y.right` is assigned the instance `z`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`m` is a non-negative integer, `top` is the root node of the binary search tree `T`, `z` is an integer representing the number of print operations, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the instance `y`. If `y` is None, then `top` is assigned the value of `z`. If `y` is not None and `z.key < y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the instance `z`. If `y` is not None and `z.key` is not less than `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the instance `z`.
    return top
    #The program returns the root node of the binary search tree T
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters: top, the root node of a binary search tree T, and z, a non-negative integer representing the number of print operations. It then traverses the binary search tree according to z.key values and updates the structure accordingly. The function returns the updated root node of the binary search tree T.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer. Each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000.**
def func_2(node, key):
    if (not node) :
        return False
        #The program returns False since the node is empty and no operations have been performed
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. Each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The node is not empty
    if (node.key == key) :
        return True
        #The program returns True if the key specified in the if condition is equal to the key of the node, otherwise it does not return anything
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. Each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The node is not empty. The node key is not equal to the key being checked in the if condition.
    if (key < node.key) :
        return func_2(node.left, key)
        #The program returns the result of calling the function func_2 with the left child of the node and the key as parameters
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. Each operation is either insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The node is not empty. The node key is not equal to the key being checked in the if condition. The key is greater than or equal to the node key
    return func_2(node.right, key)
    #The program returns the result of calling function func_2 with the right child of the node and the key as parameters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`. The function operates on a tree structure where `node` represents a node within the tree, and `key` is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The function has multiple return points based on different cases:
If the node is empty, the program returns False.
If the key matches the key of the current node, the program returns True.
If the key is less than the node's key, the function recursively calls itself with the left child of the node.
If the key is greater than or equal to the node's key, the function recursively calls itself with the right child of the node.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to search for a specific key within the tree structure and return True if found, False if not found.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer representing the number of operations. Each operation is represented by insert k, find k, or print, where k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000.**
def func_3(node):
    if node.left :
        func_3(node.left)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer representing the number of operations, each operation is represented by insert k, find k, or print, where k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. Furthermore, if node.left exists, there are no changes to the state of the program variables.
    print('', node.key, end='')
    if node.right :
        func_3(node.right)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer representing the number of operations, each operation is represented by insert k, find k, or print, where k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. Furthermore, if node.left exists, there are no changes to the state of the program variables. Additionally, if node.right exists, the program continues with the specified operations as per the value of m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts a parameter node and recursively performs operations on the left and right nodes if they exist. It prints the key of the current node. The function does not explicitly return any value. The operations carried out are based on the structure of the binary tree represented by the nodes. The function operates on insert, find, or print operations based on the keys within the specified range. If the node.left or node.right does not exist, the corresponding operations are not performed.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer. Each operation is represented by insert k, find k, or print. The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000.**
def func_4(node):
    print('', node.key, end='')
    if node.left :
        func_4(node.left)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. Depending on the implementation of func_4 and its effect on the program state when node.left is evaluated, the program state will be updated accordingly.
    if node.right :
        func_4(node.right)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. The program state is updated based on the implementation of func_4 when node.right is evaluated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts a parameter `node` which represents a node in a tree data structure. The function recursively traverses the tree starting from the given node and prints the key value of each node. It first prints the key of the current node, then recursively calls itself on the left child node if it exists, and then on the right child node if it exists. The function operates within the constraints of the key value being within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
