Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The `func_1` function is missing the implementation of the `find` operation, which is a key requirement according to the problem description. Without the `find` operation, the program is unable to report whether the binary search tree contains a node with a specific key, which is a crucial functionality. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all the required operations specified in the problem description.
