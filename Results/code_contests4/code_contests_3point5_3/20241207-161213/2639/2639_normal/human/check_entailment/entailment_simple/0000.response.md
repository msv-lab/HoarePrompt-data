Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program does not actually implement the find operation as required by the problem description. The find operation should report whether the tree has a node containing a specified key, but the program lacks this functionality.
2. The program does not handle the print operation correctly. The print operation should print the keys of the binary search tree by both inorder and preorder tree walks, but the program lacks this functionality.
3. The program lacks the necessary input parsing to handle the operations specified in the problem description.
4. The functions defined in the program do not cover all the required aspects of the problem description.

Overall, the program does not fully adhere to the problem description and hence is incorrect.
