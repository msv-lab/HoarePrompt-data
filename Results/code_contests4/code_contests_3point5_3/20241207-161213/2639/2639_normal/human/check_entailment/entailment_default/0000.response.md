Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The insert operation correctly inserts a node with the given key into the binary search tree T.
- The find operation correctly searches for a node containing the key k in the binary search tree T and returns "yes" if found and "no" if not found.
- The print operation correctly performs inorder and preorder tree walks, printing the keys of the binary search tree in the specified order.

The functions provided align with the problem description, and based on the code and descriptions, the program seems to handle all potential cases as required. The output hints also agree with the code and provide additional clarity on the functionality of each function. Since there are no apparent discrepancies or cases where the program does not follow the problem description, the correctness is deemed as True.
