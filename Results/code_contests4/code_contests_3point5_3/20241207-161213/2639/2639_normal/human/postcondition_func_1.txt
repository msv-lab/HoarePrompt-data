The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`. The function operates on a tree structure where `node` represents a node within the tree, and `key` is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The function has multiple return points based on different cases:
If the node is empty, the program returns False.
If the key matches the key of the current node, the program returns True.
If the key is less than the node's key, the function recursively calls itself with the left child of the node.
If the key is greater than or equal to the node's key, the function recursively calls itself with the right child of the node.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to search for a specific key within the tree structure and return True if found, False if not found.
