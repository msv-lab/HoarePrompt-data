    #The program returns the root node of the binary search tree T
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters: top, the root node of a binary search tree T, and z, a non-negative integer representing the number of print operations. It then traverses the binary search tree according to z.key values and updates the structure accordingly. The function returns the updated root node of the binary search tree T.

The key k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The node is not empty. The node key is not equal to the key being checked in the if condition.

The key is greater than or equal to the node key
    return func_2(node.right, key)
    #The program returns the result of calling function func_2 with the right child of the node and the key as parameters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`. The function operates on a tree structure where `node` represents a node within the tree, and `key` is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The function has multiple return points based on different cases:
If the node is empty, the program returns False.
If the key matches the key of the current node, the program returns True.
If the key is less than the node's key, the function recursively calls itself with the left child of the node.
If the key is greater than or equal to the node's key, the function recursively calls itself with the right child of the node.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to search for a specific key within the tree structure and return True if found, False if not found.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer representing the number of operations. Each operation is represented by insert k, find k, or print, where k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000.**

Furthermore, if node.left exists, there are no changes to the state of the program variables.

Furthermore, if node.left exists, there are no changes to the state of the program variables. Additionally, if node.right exists, the program continues with the specified operations as per the value of m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts a parameter node and recursively performs operations on the left and right nodes if they exist. It prints the key of the current node. The function does not explicitly return any value. The operations carried out are based on the structure of the binary tree represented by the nodes. The function operates on insert, find, or print operations based on the keys within the specified range. If the node.left or node.right does not exist, the corresponding operations are not performed.

    if node.right :
        func_4(node.right)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. The program state is updated based on the implementation of func_4 when node.right is evaluated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts a parameter `node` which represents a node in a tree data structure. The function recursively traverses the tree starting from the given node and prints the key value of each node. It first prints the key of the current node, then recursively calls itself on the left child node if it exists, and then on the right child node if it exists. The function operates within the constraints of the key value being within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000.
