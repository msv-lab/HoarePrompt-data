The function func_3 accepts a parameter node and recursively performs operations on the left and right nodes if they exist. It prints the key of the current node. The function does not explicitly return any value. The operations carried out are based on the structure of the binary tree represented by the nodes. The function operates on insert, find, or print operations based on the keys within the specified range. If the node.left or node.right does not exist, the corresponding operations are not performed.
