Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly implements the insertion operation by adding a node with the given key to the binary search tree.
2. The program correctly implements the find operation by traversing the binary search tree to check if a node with the given key exists.
3. The program correctly implements the print operation by performing inorder and preorder tree walk to print the keys of the binary search tree.
4. The program handles the input and operations as described in the problem statement.
5. The program maintains the binary search tree properties throughout the operations.
6. The program handles multiple print operations by printing the keys obtained by inorder and preorder tree walks in separate lines.
