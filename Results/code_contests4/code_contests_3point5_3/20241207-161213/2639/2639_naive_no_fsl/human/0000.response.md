Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program includes functions to insert a node into the binary search tree, find a node with a given key, and print the keys by inorder and preorder tree walks.
2. The insert function correctly adds a node to the binary search tree based on the key value.
3. The find function correctly searches for a node with a given key and returns "yes" or "no" based on whether the node is found.
4. The print function correctly prints the keys of the binary search tree by inorder and preorder tree walks.
5. The program handles the given input operations (insert, find, print) as expected and produces the correct output.
