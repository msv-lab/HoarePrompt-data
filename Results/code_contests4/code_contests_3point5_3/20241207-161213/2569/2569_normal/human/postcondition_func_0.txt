The function func_1 accepts a parameter k and iterates through a loop updating the values of 'left' and 'b' based on calculations involving lists bikes and person. After the loop, it subtracts 'left' from 'b' and returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left'. There is a potential edge case where 'left' might be negative after the loop, which is not accounted for in the annotations.
