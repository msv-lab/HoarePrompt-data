Example Answer:
The value of `pi` is calculated as -k + i. The value of `bikes[i] - person[pi]` is computed and the maximum value between 0 and that result is subtracted from `left`. The values of `left`, `b`, `i`, `k`, and `pi` are updated based on the initial state and the calculations. 
Output State: **`left` is updated based on the calculation, `b` remains 0, `i` is updated based on the calculation, `k` remains greater than 0, `pi` is updated based on the calculation.**
