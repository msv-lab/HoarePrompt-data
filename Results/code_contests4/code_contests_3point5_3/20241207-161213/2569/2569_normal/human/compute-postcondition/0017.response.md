The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `k`. The parameter constraints are as follows: n, m, and a are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105 and 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. The lists b and p contain integers where 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9 respectively. After executing the function body, the program returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left' after performing the calculations in the loop. 'i' is equal to 'k', 'pi' is updated to be 0, and 'b' is subtracted by 'left'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer 'k' and return the updated values of 'b' and 'left' after performing the specified calculations in the loop.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter k and returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left' after performing the specified calculations in the loop.**
