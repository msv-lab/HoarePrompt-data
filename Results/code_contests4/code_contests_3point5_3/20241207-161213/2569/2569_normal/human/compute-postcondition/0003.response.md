Example Answer:
`pi` is assigned the value of -k + i. The initial values of k, i, and b are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of pi. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is a non-negative integer, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, and `pi` is calculated as -k + i.
Output State: **`left` is a non-negative integer, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is calculated as -k + i**
