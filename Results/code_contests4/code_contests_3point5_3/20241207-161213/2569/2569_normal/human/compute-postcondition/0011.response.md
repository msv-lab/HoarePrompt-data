Example Answer:
`pi` is assigned the value of -k + i. The previous values of k, i, and pi are known. 
Given that k is greater than 0, and i is updated and incremented by 1, the value of pi will be -k + i.
Output State: **`left` is updated, `b` is incremented, `i` is updated and incremented by 1, `k` remains greater than 0, `pi` is updated**
