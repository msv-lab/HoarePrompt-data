Example Answer:
The value of `left` is updated by subtracting the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `bikes[i]` and `person[pi]`. The value of `b` is incremented by the minimum value between `person[-k + i]` and `bikes[i]`. `i` is updated and incremented by 1, and `pi` is updated to -k + i. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is updated based on the calculation, `b` is incremented by the minimum value between `person[-k + i]` and `bikes[i]`, `i` is updated based on the calculation and incremented by 1, `k` remains greater than 0, `pi` is updated to -k + i.
Output State: **`left` is updated based on the calculation, `b` is incremented by the minimum value between `person[-k + i]` and `bikes[i]`, `i` is updated based on the calculation and incremented by 1, `k` remains greater than 0, `pi` is updated to -k + i**
