Example Answer: 
`left` is updated by subtracting the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `bikes[i]` and `person[pi]`. The values of `b`, `i`, `k`, and `pi` are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is updated, `b` is incremented, `i` is updated and incremented by 1, `k` remains greater than 0, `pi` is updated.
Output State: **`left` is updated, `b` is incremented, `i` is updated and incremented by 1, `k` remains greater than 0, `pi` is updated**
