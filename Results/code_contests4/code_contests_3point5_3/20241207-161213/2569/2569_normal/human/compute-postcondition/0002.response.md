According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `left` being a non-negative integer and `b` being 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`left` is a non-negative integer, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0**
