Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a parameter `k` and iterates through a loop to calculate the maximum number of schoolboys that can rent a bike and the minimum total personal money needed. The loop updates the values of `left` and `b` based on the calculations involving the lists `bikes` and `person`, which aligns with the problem description. After the loop, it subtracts `left` from `b` and returns the updated values, which also aligns with the expected output of the problem description. The program correctly determines the maximum number of schoolboys that can rent a bike and the minimum total personal money needed.
