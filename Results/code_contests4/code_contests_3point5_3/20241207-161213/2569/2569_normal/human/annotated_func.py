#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and a are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105 and 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. The lists b and p contain integers where 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9 respectively.**
def func_1(k):
    left = a
    b = 0
    for i in range(k):
        pi = -k + i
        
        left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])
        
        b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left` and `b` are updated based on the calculations in the loop, `i` is equal to `k`, `pi` is updated to be -k + k = 0
    b -= left
    return b, left
    #The program returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left' after performing the calculations in the loop. 'i' is equal to 'k', 'pi' is updated to be 0, and 'b' is subtracted by 'left'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter k and iterates through a loop updating the values of 'left' and 'b' based on calculations involving lists bikes and person. After the loop, it subtracts 'left' from 'b' and returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left'. There is a potential edge case where 'left' might be negative after the loop, which is not accounted for in the annotations.
