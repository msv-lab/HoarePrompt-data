According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` to reach or exceed `newn`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 3, `newizv` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `newizv` is updated to be the result of multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` to reach or exceed `newn`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 4, `newizv` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `newizv` is updated to be the result of multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1**
