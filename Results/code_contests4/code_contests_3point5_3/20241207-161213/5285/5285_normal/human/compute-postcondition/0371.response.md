Example Answer:
The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 2, so after execution, `st` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 3, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is 3, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`**
