According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `st` and `i`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. As the loop increases `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute another time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. 
Additionally, the condition for the loop to execute another time is based on `st`, which is greater than 0. Since `st` is not modified within the loop, it remains the same at the end of the previous iteration. However, `newizv` has been updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute another time, `newizv` should reflect this update.

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` has been updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1 for the loop to execute another time**
