Example Answer:
The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 1, so after execution, `st` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, `newnewk` is less than or equal to 0, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is adjusted accordingly, `i` is less than 10 for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newnewk` by `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is 2, `newnewk` is less than or equal to 0, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is adjusted accordingly, `i` is less than 10 for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newnewk` by `newk`**
