Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and the value of `newnewk` changes based on the previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is 2, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with `newk`**
