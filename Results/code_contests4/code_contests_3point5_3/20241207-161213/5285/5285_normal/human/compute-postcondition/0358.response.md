According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, so it will always execute if the condition `i < 10` is met. At the end of the previous iteration, `st` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1 for each iteration, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is calculated as the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1 for each iteration, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is calculated as the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
