According to the code, the loop will always execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` contains the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`. Since the loop will always execute, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 10.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` contains the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`**
