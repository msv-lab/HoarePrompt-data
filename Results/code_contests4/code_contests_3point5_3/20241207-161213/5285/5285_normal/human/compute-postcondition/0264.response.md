According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated as described, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, and `newn` is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated as described, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
