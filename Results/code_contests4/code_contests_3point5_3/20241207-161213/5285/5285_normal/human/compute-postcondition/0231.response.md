Example Answer:
The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st-1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`, `izv` is updated accordingly, `newn` is updated according to the formula provided.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st-1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`, `izv` is updated accordingly, `newn` is updated according to the formula provided**
