Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is equal to the final iteration value, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1 for each iteration, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds `newn`**
