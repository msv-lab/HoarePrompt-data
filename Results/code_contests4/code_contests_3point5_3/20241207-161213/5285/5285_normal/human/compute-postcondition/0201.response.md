Example Answer:
The value of `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, where `newizv` is calculated as `(2^st) - 1`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are known. Therefore, after execution, the value of `izv` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` is incremented by `(2^st) - 1`, `newn` is updated to `newn - (newk^st)` and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk^st`, `izv` is updated with the incremented value**
