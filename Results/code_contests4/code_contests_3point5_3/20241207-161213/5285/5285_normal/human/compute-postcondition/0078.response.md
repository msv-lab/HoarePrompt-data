According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on the multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is equal to `(2^st) * newizv + 2^st - 1`, `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st` again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated, `newizv` is calculated, for the loop to execute `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
