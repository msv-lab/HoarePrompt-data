According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `st` must be greater than 1.
State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds `newn`**
