Example Answer:
`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and the value of `newk` is greater than 0. Therefore, after execution, `newnewk` will have the same value as `newk`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` contains the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `i` is increased by 1, `newnewk` is the same value as `newk`**
