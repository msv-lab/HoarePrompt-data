Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `st` are updated in the process. The loop will execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk`. The value of `newizv` is updated as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` have new values, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, `newn` is updated, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, `newn` is greater than `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` have new values, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, `newn` is updated, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, `newn` is greater than `newk`**
