Example Answer:
`b` is divided by `cur`. The value of `cur` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is unknown. The value of `b` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1**
