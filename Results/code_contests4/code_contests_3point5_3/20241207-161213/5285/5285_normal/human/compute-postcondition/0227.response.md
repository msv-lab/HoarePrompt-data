Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and then adding 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value is calculated based on the formula. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated with the new calculated value, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is updated with the new `newizv` value, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated with the new calculated value, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is updated with the new `newizv` value, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk`**
