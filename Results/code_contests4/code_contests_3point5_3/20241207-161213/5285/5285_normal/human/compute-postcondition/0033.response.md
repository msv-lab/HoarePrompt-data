Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value 3. The previous values of the variables are known, `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, and `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1 if `b % cur == 0`, and `b` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1 if `b % cur == 0`, and `b` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `cur` is 3.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1 if `b % cur == 0`, and `b` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `cur` is 3**
