Example Answer: 
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. The new value of `newizv` depends on its previous value. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, for the loop to execute again `st` must be greater than the current value of `i + 1`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, for the loop to execute again `st` must be greater than the current value of `i + 1`**
