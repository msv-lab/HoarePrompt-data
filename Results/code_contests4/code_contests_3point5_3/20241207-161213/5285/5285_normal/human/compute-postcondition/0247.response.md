According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, so it is not directly given. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. 
State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`**
