Example Answer:
`izv` is updated by adding the value of `newizv`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute again `newn` needs to be greater than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is updated by adding the value of `newizv`.
Output State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute again `newn` needs to be greater than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is updated by adding the value of `newizv`.**
