Postcondition: ***`st`, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `mlt`, `res` are all integers. `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i` have been updated with new values as described. `izv` has been updated by adding `newizv` multiple times. `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`. `i` is equal to `st - 1`. `newizv` has been updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. `newn` is 0. `i` is equal to 10. `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`. After the execution of the if block, `mlt` is less than `res`, and `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`. If res is -1, the overall state remains the same. Otherwise, the overall state is updated as described in the else part.***
