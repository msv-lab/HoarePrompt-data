Example Answer:
`newk` is assigned the value of `k`, but the initial value of `k` is not provided. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn` are all integers, `d_osn` still has elements, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.
Output State: **`st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn` are all integers, `d_osn` still has elements, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`**
