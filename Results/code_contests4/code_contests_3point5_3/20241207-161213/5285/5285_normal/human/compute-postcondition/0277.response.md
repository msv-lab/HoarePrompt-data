Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `mlt`. However, the value of `mlt` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 9, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `newk` is the final value assigned during the loop execution, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is 0, loop exits after `i` becomes 10. The value of `res` is -1**
