According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `st` and `i`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` is updated, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is the sum of `newizv`, `newn` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is doubled and incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **After the if-else block executes, `st` is the number of times the loop executed and is greater than 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated based on the previous value of `newizv`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is doubled and incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur**.
