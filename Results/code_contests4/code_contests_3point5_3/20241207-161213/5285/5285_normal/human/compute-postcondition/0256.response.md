Postcondition: ***`st`, `newnewk`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn` are integers. `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. If `st` is equal to 0, then `st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` to reach or exceed `newn`, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, and `newn` is 0. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
