According to the code, the loop will execute `st` number of times. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `st` must be greater than 0. The initial values of `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `d_osn`, `newk` should remain the same. The value of `newn` should be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0. The value of `newnewk` should be the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, and `newnewk` should not be greater than `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, the loop should not execute, so `st` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
