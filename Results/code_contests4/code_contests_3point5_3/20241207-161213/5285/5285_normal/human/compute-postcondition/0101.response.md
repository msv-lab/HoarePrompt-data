Output State: **`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated based on the previous value of `newizv`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is equal to 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
