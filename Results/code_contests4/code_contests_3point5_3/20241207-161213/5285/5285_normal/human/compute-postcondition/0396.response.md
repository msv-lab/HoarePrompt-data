Output State: **'st' is greater than 0, 'i' is equal to 'st', 'newizv' is equal to (2^st) - 1, 'izv' is updated with the sum of its previous value and (2^i) - 1, 'newn' is 0, 'd_osn' still has elements, 'newk' remains the same, 'newnewk' is the product of 'newk' raised to the power of 'st', 'newnewk' is not greater than 'newn', loop control variable 'newn' is 0, 'mlt' is assigned the integer division result of 'izv' and 'd_osn[k]'. Additionally, the condition 'res == -1' is true, 'res' is assigned the value of 'mlt'.**
