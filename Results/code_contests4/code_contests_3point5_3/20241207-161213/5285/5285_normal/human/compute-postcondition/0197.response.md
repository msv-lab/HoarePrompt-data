According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. So, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `izv` needs to be incremented by `(2^st) - 1`.
2. `newn` needs to be updated to `newn - newk`.

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `(2^st) - 1`, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`**
