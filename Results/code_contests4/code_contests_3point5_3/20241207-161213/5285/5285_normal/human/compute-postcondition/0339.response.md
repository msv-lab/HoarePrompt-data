Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, loop control variable `newnewk` exceeds `newn` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
