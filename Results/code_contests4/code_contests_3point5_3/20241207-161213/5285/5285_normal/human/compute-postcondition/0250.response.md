According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` and then multiplied by `newk`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `newnewk` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
