Example Answer:
`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by itself. The previous value of `newk` is the same as `k`, which is not given. Therefore, the output state is: `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be less than or equal to `n`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by itself and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be less than or equal to `n`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by itself and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
