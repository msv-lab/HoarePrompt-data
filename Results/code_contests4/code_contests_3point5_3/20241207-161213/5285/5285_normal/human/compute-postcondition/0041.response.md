Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. The loop has terminated, with `b` being less than or equal to 1. The values in `d_osn` have been updated based on the divisibility of `b` by `cur` during the loop iterations. The final value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`. Additionally, `b` is greater than 2. `d_osn[b]` is incremented by 1.**
