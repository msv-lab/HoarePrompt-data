Output State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1 for each iteration, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is calculated as the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
