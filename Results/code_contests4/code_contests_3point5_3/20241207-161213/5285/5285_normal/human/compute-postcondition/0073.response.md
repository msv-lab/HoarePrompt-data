Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` will be `2*newizv + 1`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than `i + 1`, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is `2*newizv + 1`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than `i + 1`, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is `2*newizv + 1`**
