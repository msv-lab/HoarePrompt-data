According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is 2 and it needs to be less than or equal to `newn` for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 2, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
