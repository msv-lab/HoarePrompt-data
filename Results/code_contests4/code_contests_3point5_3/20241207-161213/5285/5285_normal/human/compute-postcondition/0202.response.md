Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are greater than 0, so the result of the subtraction is dependent on those values. The value stored in `newn` is updated accordingly. The loop will execute again as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` is incremented by `(2^st) - 1`, `newn` is updated to the new calculated value, and the loop continues.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` is incremented by `(2^st) - 1`, `newn` is updated to the new calculated value, and the loop continues**
