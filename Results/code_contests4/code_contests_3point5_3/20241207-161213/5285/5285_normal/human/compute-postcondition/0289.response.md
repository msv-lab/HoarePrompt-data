Example Answer:
`st` is assigned the value of 0. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements**
