According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated according to the formula provided in the code. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` should be greater than `newk ** st`. Additionally, `izv` is updated during each iteration, so it needs to be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st-1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is updated according to the loop iterations, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk ** st` and `newn` is updated according to the formula**
