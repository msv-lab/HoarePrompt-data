Example Answer: 
`izv` is updated by adding `newizv` to its previous value. Since `newizv` is calculated as (2^st) - 1, and `st` is equal to `i`, `newizv` is (2^i) - 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `izv` will be updated by adding (2^i) - 1 to its previous value. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` is updated with the sum of its previous value and (2^i) - 1, `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st` minus the new value calculated by `newk, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
