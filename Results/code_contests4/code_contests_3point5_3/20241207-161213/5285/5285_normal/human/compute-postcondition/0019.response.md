According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is greater than 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `b` should be updated based on the conditions provided (b % cur == 0)
- `cur` should be updated to satisfy the condition that `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`

State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. For the loop to execute the first time, `b` is greater than 1. The necessary adjustments need to be made to `b` and `cur` based on the provided conditions for the loop to execute one more time.**
