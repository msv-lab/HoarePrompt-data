The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the constraints provided for integers n and b, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12. The function calculates and returns a specific output based on the values of n and b, but the exact nature of this calculation is not specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform a calculation based on the constraints given for integers n and b.
