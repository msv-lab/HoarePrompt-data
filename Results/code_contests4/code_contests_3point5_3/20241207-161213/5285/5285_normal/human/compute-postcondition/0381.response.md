Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated according to the formula, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `st`**
