Example Answer:
The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The variables `st`, `i`, `newizv`, and `izv` remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute again is still satisfied. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` is updated with the sum of its previous value and (2^i) - 1, `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st` minus the new value calculated by `newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` is updated with the sum of its previous value and (2^i) - 1, `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st` minus the new value calculated by `newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
