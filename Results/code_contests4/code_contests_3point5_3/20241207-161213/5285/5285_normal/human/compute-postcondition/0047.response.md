Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, loop has terminated, `b` is less than or equal to 1, values in `d_osn` updated based on divisibility of `b` by `cur`, final value of `cur` is greater than or equal to square root of original value of `b`, if `b` is greater than 2 then `d_osn[b]` is incremented by 1, `izv` is a defaultdict with integer values, `res` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `d_osn` has at least one key-value pair, `k` is the first key in `d_osn`, `cur` is set to square root of original value of `b`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`**
