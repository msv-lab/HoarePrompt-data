Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st-1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is updated according to the loop iterations, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`.**
