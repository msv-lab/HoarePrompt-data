Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. The previous value of `newizv` is not given, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `newizv`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds `newn`.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds `newn`**
