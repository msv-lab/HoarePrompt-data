According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, to execute the loop again, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`st` is 2, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
