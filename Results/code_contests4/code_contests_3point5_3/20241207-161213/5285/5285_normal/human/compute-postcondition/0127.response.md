Example Answer:
The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `newnewk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn` and `i` is less than 10.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `newnewk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn` and `i` is less than 10**
