According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `st`, `newnewk`, and `newn`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. In addition, `newk` is updated based on multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, and `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, for the loop to execute again `st` must be greater than the current value of `i + 1`**
