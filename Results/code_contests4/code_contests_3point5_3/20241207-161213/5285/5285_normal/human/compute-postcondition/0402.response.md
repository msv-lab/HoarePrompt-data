Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `st`, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `mlt`, `res` are all integers. The variables have been updated according to the loop code, and `res` will hold the minimum value of `mlt` calculated during the iterations of the loop. If the loop does not execute at all, the overall state will remain the same as the initial state.**
