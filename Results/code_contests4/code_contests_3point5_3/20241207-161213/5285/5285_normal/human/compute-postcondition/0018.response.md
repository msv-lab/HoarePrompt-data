Postcondition: ***`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. For the loop to execute the first time, `b` is greater than 1. If the remainder of `b` divided by `cur` is 0, then `b` is divided by `cur`. Otherwise, if `cur` is equal to 2, then `cur` is updated to 3. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to 2, then `cur` is updated to 4. In both cases, the condition (b % cur == 0) remains false after the execution of the if else block. Additionally, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`***.
