Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`, but the initial value of `newizv` is not provided, so the output state is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` has been updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` has been updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1**
