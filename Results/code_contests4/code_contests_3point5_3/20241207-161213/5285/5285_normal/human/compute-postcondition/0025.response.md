Postcondition: ***`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. For the loop to execute the first time, `b` is greater than 1. The necessary adjustments need to be made to `b` and `cur` based on the provided conditions for the loop to execute one more time. If `cur` is 2, the loop executes with the same conditions set for the first execution. If `cur` is not 2, the loop executes with different conditions where `b` needs to be greater than 3 for the loop to run one more time.***
