Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated based on the previous value of `newizv`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is 0. The condition `st == 0` is satisfied, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
