Example Answer:
`b` is divided by `cur`, and `cur` is a variable not defined in the initial state. The value of `b` may change depending on the value of `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1 if `b % cur == 0`, and `b` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1 if `b % cur == 0`, and `b` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1.**
