Output State: `st` is 2, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated based on the previous value of `newizv`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` should have been non-negative in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`.
