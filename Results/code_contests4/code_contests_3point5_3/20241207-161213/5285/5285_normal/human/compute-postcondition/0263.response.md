Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` to reach or exceed `newn`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is the result of multiplying the initial value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
