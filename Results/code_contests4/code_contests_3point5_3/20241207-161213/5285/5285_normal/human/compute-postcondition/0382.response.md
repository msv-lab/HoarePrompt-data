Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
