According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, `st`, and the calculated value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated, `newizv` is calculated, and for the loop to execute `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Update `newn` by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
2. Increment `newizv`.
3. Ensure `newn` remains greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated, `newizv` is calculated, for the loop to execute `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
