According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn` for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 2, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` contains the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk`**
