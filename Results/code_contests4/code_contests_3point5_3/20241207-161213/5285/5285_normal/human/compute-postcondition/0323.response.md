According to the code, since the loop condition is `while True and i < 10`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the final iteration value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 10. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is updated, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0**
