According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `d_osn` collection. At the end of the last iteration, the variables are `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, and `newn`. To execute the loop one more time, `d_osn` should still have elements remaining.
State: **`st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn` are all integers, `d_osn` still has elements**
