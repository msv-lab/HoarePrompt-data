According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` is updated with the sum of its previous value and `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st` minus the new value calculated by `newk. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` is updated with the sum of its previous value and `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st` minus the new value calculated by `newk, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
