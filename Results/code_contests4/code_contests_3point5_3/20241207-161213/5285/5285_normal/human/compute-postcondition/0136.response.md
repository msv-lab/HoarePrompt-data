Output State: **`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the initial value of `newk` by itself `st` times, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is adjusted accordingly, `i` is 10 for the loop to stop executing, and `st` is equal to 0. The code breaks out of the loop or if statement.**
