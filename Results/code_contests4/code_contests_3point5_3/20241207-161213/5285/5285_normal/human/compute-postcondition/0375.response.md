Postcondition: ***`st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `d_osn`, `newk`, `newnewk` are integers. `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
