According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is greater than 0 and `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` remains the same, and `st` is equal to `st`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` is updated with the sum of its previous value and `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
