Example Answer:
`newk` is assigned the value of `k`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st`, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `mlt`, `res` are all integers. `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn` have been updated with new values as described. `izv` is 0. `i` is equal to 10. `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`. After the execution of the if block, `mlt` is less than `res`, and `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`. If res is -1, the overall state remains the same. Otherwise, the overall state is updated as described in the else part. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must move to the next key in the dictionary `d_osn`.
