Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated based on the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1`, `newk` is the initial value, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk after the loop finishes, and `st` remains the same**
