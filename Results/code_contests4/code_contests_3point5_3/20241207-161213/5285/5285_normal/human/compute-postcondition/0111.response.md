Example Answer:
The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, but the previous value of `izv` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `st` is incremented, `newk` is updated, `newizv` is calculated for the next iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than the updated `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
Output State: **`st` is incremented, `newk` is updated, `newizv` is calculated for the next iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than the updated `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`**
