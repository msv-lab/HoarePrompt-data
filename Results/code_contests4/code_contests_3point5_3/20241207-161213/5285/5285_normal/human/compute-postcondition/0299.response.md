According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by itself. So for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `k` must still be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute the first time, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
