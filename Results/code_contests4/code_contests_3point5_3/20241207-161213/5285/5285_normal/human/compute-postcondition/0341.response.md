According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is less than 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `st` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and loop control variable `newnewk` exceeds `newn` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, loop control variable `newnewk` exceeds `newn` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
