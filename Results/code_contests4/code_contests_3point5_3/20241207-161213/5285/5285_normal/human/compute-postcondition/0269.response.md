Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The initial value of `newn` is greater than 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, and `st` is equal to `i`, so the new value of `newn` is calculated accordingly. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated as described, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is the previous value plus `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated as described, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is the previous value plus `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
