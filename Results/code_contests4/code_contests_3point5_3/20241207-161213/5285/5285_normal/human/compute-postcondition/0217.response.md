Output State: **`st` is 3, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` contains the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk`**
