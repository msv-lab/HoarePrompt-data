According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is 2, and `newn` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 2, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated based on the previous value of `newizv`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` should have been non-negative in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to 0**
