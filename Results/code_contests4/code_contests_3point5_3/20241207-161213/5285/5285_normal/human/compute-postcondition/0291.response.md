Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value 0. The value of `newizv` is already 0, so there is no change in the value. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements**
