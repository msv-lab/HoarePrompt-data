Example Answer:
The value of `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1. The initial state does not provide specific values for `cur` and `d_osn[cur]`, so after the execution, the output state will be: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1**
