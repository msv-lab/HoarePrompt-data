According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. 
Right before the loop, `newnewk` is 0, `newn` is the value of `n`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to the value of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `newnewk` is 0, `newk` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`, `res` is assigned the value of `mlt` after the execution of the if block, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`**
