Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are known, so the new value of `newn` can be calculated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` have new values, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, `newn` is updated, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1**
