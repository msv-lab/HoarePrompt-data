According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Since the loop condition is `while True and i < 10`, the `True` part of the condition does not affect the loop termination. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is 0 and `i` is not given. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value less than 10.
State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on the multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is equal to `(2^st) * newizv + 2^st - 1`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0 and for the loop to execute again `i` is less than 10**
