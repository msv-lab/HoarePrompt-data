According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, so it should remain the same. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` have new values, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
