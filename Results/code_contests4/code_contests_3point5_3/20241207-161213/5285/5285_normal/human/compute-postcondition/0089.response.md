Output State: **`st` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to the previous value of `newk`, `newk` is updated based on the multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is equal to `(2^0) * newizv + 2^0 - 1`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0**
