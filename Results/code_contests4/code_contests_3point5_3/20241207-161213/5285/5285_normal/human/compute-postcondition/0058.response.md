According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn` by at least 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
