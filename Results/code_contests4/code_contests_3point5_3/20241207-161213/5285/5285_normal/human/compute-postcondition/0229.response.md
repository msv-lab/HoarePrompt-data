According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`. For the loop to execute the first time, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st-1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk`**
