Example Answer: 
`st` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is 0.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is 0**
