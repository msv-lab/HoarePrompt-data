Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn`, `d_osn` are all integers, `d_osn` still has elements, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn`, `d_osn` are all integers, `d_osn` still has elements, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 0**
