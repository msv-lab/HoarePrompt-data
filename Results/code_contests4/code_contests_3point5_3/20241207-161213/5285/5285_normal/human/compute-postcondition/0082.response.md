Example Answer:
The value of `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated, `newizv` is calculated, for the loop to execute `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated, `newizv` is calculated, for the loop to execute `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
