Output State: **After the loop executes, `st` is the number of times the loop executed and is greater than 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` is updated based on the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated based on the previous value of `newizv`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` for all iterations, `newn` is 0, `i` is equal to `st`, and `newizv` is calculated by doubling the previous value and adding 1 for each iteration.**
