Example Answer:
The value of `izv` is updated by adding `newizv` to its current value. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`.
Output State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`**
