Example Answer: 
`izv` is assigned the value 0, so after execution, `izv` is 0. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn` are all integers, `d_osn` still has elements, and `izv` is 0.
Output State: **`st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn` are all integers, `d_osn` still has elements, `izv` is 0**
