Example Answer: 
`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and `newk` is the same as `k`, so after execution, `newnewk` is the same as `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the same as `k`.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the same as `k`**
