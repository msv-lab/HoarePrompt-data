Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` is updated with the sum of its previous value and `newizv`, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
