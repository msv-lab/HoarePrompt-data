Example Answer: 
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, but the initial value of `newnewk` and `newk` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`st` is 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
