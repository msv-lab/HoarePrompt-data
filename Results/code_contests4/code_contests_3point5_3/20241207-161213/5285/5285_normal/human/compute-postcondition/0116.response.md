According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` remains the same and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
