Example Answer:
The value of `newizv` is added to `izv`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is equal to the final iteration value, `newizv` is updated, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is updated, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is equal to the final iteration value, `newizv` is updated, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is updated, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk`**
