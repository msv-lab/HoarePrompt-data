According to the code, the loop can execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is 0, and `newn` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be adjusted to less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`**
