According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the precondition states that if `st` is equal to 0, the loop breaks. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `st` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i` are all integers**.
