According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is the same as `k`, and `newn` is the same as `n`. So for the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be less than or equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be less than or equal to `n`**
