According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 3.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` to reach or exceed `newn`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 3, `newizv` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
