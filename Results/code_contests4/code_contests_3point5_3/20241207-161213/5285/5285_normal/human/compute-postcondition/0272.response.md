Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, where `st`, `newk`, and `newn` have specific initial values. The loop will execute one more time if `newk` is less than `newn`. Other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated as described, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is the previous value plus `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute one more time `newk` must be less than `newn`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated as described, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is the previous value plus `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute one more time `newk` must be less than `newn`**
