Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not mentioned, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `izv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`.
Output State: **`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`**
