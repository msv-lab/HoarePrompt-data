Output State: **`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`, `st` is equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
