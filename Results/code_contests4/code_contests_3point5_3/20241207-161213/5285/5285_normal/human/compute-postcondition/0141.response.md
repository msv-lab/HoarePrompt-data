Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` will depend on the initial value. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` has a new value, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `newizv` is updated based on its previous value.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` has a new value, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `newizv` is updated based on its previous value**
