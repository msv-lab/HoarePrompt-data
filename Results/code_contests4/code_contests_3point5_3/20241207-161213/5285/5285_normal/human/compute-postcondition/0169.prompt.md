You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state right before the loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one time, please simply repeat the program state right before the loop. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer. `n` beinng an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**

Example 2:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, students is 2 less than its initial value, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then students is 2 less than its initial value and students currently is greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State right before the while loop: `st`, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `mlt`, `res` are all integers. `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `newn` have been updated with new values as described. `izv` is 0. `i` is equal to 0. `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`. `res` is assigned the value of `mlt` after the execution of the if block. If `res` is -1, the overall state remains the same. Otherwise, the overall state is updated as described in the else part. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must move to the next key in the dictionary `d_osn`. `newn` is assigned the value of `n`.
```
while True and i < 10:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
