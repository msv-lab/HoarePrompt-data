Output State: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st) - 1, `izv` is updated with the sum of its previous value and (2^i) - 1, `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st` minus the new value calculated by `newk` until `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`, loop control variable `newn` is 0.
