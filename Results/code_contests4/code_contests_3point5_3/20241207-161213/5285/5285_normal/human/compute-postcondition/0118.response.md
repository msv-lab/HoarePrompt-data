Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are unknown, so the output state is: `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`.
Output State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`**
