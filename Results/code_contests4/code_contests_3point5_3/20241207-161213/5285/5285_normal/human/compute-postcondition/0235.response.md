According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Additionally, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, which is `(2^st) - 1`, so `izv` needs to be updated. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st-1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is updated, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`**
