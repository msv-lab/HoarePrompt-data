Example Answer:
The value of `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous values of `izv`, `newizv`, and other variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st-1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`, and `izv` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st-1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`, `izv` is updated accordingly**
