According to the code, the loop can execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by itself. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be less than or equal to `n`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by itself and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
