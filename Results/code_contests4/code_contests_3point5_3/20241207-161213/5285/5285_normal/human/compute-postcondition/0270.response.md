According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, so `newk` should be adjusted to be less than `newn` for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated as described, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is the previous value plus `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute one more time `newk` must be less than `newn`**
