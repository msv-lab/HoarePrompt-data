Example Answer: 
`izv` is updated by adding the value of `newizv`, where `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. The other variables are not affected directly by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` have new values, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, `newn` is updated, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` have new values, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, `newn` is updated, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk**
