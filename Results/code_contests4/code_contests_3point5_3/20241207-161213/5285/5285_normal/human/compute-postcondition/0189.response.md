According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `st` and `i`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` has been updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1. In the for loop, the `i` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `st` should still be greater than 0 and `i` should be 1.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` has been updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1 for the loop to execute another time**
