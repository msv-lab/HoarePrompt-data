Since the `while` loop condition is `True and i < 10`, the loop will certainly execute at least one time. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`st`, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `mlt`, `res` are all integers. `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `newn` have been updated with new values as described. `izv` is 0. `i` is equal to 0. `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`. `res` is assigned the value of `mlt` after the execution of the if block. If `res` is -1, the overall state remains the same. Otherwise, the overall state is updated as described in the else part. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must move to the next key in the dictionary `d_osn`. `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
