Postcondition: ***`st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` before exceeding `newn`, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds `newn`, and `st` is equal to 0. When the program fragment is executed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the state of the program variables remains unchanged.***
