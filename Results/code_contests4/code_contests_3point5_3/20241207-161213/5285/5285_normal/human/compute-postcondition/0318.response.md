Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` to the power of `st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are given in the initial state. After execution, `newn` will have a new value calculated as described. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is equal to the final iteration value, `newizv` is updated, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is updated with the new calculated value, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is equal to the final iteration value, `newizv` is updated, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is updated with the new calculated value, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk`**
