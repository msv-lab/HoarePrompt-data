According to the code, the loop can execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, so the loop can execute the first time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` contains the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `i` is increased by 1, `newnewk` is the same value as `newk`**
