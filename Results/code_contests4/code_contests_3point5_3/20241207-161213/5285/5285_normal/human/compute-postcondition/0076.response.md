Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on the multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is equal to `(2^st) * newizv + 2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than the initial value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on the multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is equal to `(2^st) * newizv + 2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than the initial value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`**
