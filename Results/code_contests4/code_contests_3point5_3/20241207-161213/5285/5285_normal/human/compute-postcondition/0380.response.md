According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. At the start of the loop, `i` is increased by 1 so i is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `st`.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated based on the formula newizv = newizv * 2 + 1, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is not greater than `newn`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `st`**
