According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `b` is an integer within the specified range. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` is greater than 1**
