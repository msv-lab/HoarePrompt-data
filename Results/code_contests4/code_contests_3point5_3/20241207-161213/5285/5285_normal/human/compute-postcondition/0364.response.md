Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, where `newnewk` is 0 and `newk` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `newnewk` remains 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is 0.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is 0**
