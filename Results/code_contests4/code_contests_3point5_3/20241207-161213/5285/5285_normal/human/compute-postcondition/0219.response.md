Postcondition: ***`st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` until it exceeds `newn`, `i` is 10, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is greater than 0, `izv` contains the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk` after the loop finishes, `st` equals 0***
