According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` has a new value, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
