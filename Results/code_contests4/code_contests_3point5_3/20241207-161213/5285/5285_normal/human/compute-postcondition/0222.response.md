According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is the initial value of `newk`, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, and `st` remains the same value.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is the initial value, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk` after the loop finishes, and `st` remains the same**
