Postcondition: ***`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 9, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `newk` is the final value assigned during the loop execution, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is 0, loop exits after `i` becomes 10, `res` is not equal to -1. If `mlt` is less than `res`, the program will execute the if part.***
