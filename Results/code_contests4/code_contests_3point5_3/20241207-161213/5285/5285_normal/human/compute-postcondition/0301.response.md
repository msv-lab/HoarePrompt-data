Output State: **`st` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `k` must still be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute the first time, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`**
