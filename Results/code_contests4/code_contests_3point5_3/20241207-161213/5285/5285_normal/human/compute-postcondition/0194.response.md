According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, and `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` should be adjusted to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`**
