Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by `newizv`, where `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`. The previous values of the variables are `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, and for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk, `izv` is incremented by `(2^st) - 1`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk, `izv` is incremented by `(2^st) - 1`**
