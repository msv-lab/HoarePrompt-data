Example Answer:
`d_osn` is assigned a defaultdict with integer values. The other variables `n`, `b`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values**
