Output State: **`st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` to reach or exceed `newn`, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and `st` is equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
