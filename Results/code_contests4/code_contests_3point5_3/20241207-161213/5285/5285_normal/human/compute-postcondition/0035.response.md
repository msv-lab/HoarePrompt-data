Postcondition: ***`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1 if `b % cur == 0`, `b` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If cur == 2, then `cur` is 3. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 2.***
