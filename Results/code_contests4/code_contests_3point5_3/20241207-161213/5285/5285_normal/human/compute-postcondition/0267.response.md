According to the code, the loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `newn` needs to be updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated as described, `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `izv` is the previous value plus `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
