Example Answer:
`cur` is incremented by 2, so if the previous value of `cur` was 2, it will now be 4. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 4, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` is greater than 1. The condition (b % cur == 0) is false, and `cur` is not equal to 2.
