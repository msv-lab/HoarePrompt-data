Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is equal to the final iteration value, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1 for each iteration, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `d_osn` still has elements, and `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds `newn`**
