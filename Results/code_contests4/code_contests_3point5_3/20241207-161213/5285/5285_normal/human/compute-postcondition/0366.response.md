According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is 0, and `newn` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 since `newnewk` is already less than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than 0, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is 0**
