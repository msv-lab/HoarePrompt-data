Example Answer:
`st` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `st` is 3. The other variables remain the same as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 3, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is 3, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with `newk`**
