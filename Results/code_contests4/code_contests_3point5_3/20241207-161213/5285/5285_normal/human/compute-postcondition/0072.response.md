According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `st` and `i`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `st` must be greater than the current value of `i + 1`.
State: **`st` is greater than `i + 1`, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newk` is updated based on multiplication with the previous value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1**
