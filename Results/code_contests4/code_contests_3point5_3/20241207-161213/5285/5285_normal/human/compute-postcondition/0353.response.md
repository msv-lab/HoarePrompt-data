Example Answer:
The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since the initial state mentions that `newn` is greater than 0 and is updated accordingly, and `newk` remains the same, the new value of `newn` will be the previous value of `newn` minus `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 
Output State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1 for each iteration, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is the new value after subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` remains the same, `newnewk` is calculated as the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, loop control variable `newnewk` exceeds `newn` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
