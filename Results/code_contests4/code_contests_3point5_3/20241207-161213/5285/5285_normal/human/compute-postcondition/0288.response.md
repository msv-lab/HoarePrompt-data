According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st`, `i` is 1, `newizv`, `newk`, `izv` is 0, `newn`, `d_osn` are all integers, `d_osn` still has elements, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
