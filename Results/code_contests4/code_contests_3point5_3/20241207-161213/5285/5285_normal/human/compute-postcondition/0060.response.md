Example Answer:
`st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`st` is 2, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
