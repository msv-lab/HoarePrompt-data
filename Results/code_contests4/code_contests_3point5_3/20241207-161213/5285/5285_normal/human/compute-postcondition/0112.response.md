Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `st` are used in this calculation. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `st` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, other variables are unchanged.
Output State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, other variables are unchanged**
