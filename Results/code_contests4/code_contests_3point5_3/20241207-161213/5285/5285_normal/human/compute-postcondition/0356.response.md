Example Answer:
`newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are unknown, so the value of `newn` after execution cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`.
Output State: **`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`**
