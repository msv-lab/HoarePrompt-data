Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `st` are known and `newk` remains the same. Therefore, after execution, the updated value of `newn` is calculated. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is equal to the final iteration value, `newizv` is updated, `newk` remains the same, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is the updated value after subtraction, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` to the power of `st`**
