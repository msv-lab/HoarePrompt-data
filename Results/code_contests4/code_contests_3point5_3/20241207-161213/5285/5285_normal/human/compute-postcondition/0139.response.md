Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` will depend on the initial value of `newizv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` has a new value, `izv`, `newn`, `i` are all integers.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` has a new value, `izv`, `newn`, `i` are all integers**
