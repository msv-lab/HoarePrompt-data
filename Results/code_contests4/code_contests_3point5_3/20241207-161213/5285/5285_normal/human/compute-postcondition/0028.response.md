Postcondition: ***`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1 if `b % cur == 0`. If `cur` is 2, the loop runs with the same conditions as the first execution. If `cur` is not 2, the loop runs with different conditions where `b` needs to be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time. After the if else block executes, the program variables retain their initial values and conditions as described in the Precondition.***
