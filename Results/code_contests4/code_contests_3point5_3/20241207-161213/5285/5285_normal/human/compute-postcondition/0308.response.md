According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` has been updated, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` has been calculated, and `st` is still equal to 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `st` should remain the same.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `newk` remains the same as `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` remains the same as `n`, `d_osn` still has elements, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself consecutively until it exceeds `newn`, and `st` is equal to 0**
