Postcondition: ***`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `mlt` are all updated with new values. `izv` is updated by adding `newizv` multiple times, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1, `newn` is 0, `i` is equal to 10, `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`, and `res` is not equal to -1. Additionally, `mlt` is less than `res` after the if condition is met.***
