Example Answer:
`mlt` is assigned the value of `izv` divided by `d_osn[k]`. The values of `izv` and `d_osn[k]` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `mlt`. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 9, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `newk` is the final value assigned during the loop execution, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is 0, loop exits after `i` becomes 10.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 9, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `newk` is the final value assigned during the loop execution, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added during each iteration, `newn` is 0, loop exits after `i` becomes 10**
