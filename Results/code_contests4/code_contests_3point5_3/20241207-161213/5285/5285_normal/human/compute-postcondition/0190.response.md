Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1. Since the initial value of `newizv` is updated in such a way, the new value after execution will be the previous value of `newizv` multiplied by 2 and then added 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` has been updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1 for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` has been updated by doubling its previous value and adding 1 for the loop to execute another time**
