Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also indicate some discrepancies in the code. One such case is when the input is `5 2`, the expected output is `3`, but the code does not produce the correct output for this scenario. The code needs to be updated to handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
