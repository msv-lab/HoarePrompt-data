Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!.

There are several issues in the program:
1. The program reads input using `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. The correct function to use is `input()`.
2. The usage of `defaultdict` is incorrect in the program.
3. The logic to calculate the number of trailing zeros is not implemented correctly.
4. The program is hard to follow due to unclear variable names and lack of comments.

Therefore, based on the issues mentioned above, the program is incorrect.
