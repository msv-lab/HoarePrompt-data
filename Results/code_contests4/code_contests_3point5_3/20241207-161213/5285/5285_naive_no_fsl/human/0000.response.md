Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for n and b. It then calculates the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!. The program uses a loop to factorize b and calculate the power of each prime factor in the factorial n!. It then calculates the minimum number of trailing zeros based on the power of each prime factor. Finally, it outputs the result which represents the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
