Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. It checks for each pair communicated by both participants, determines if there is a shared number, and outputs the correct result as per the given rules. The logic implemented in the program ensures that the shared number is deduced with certainty, or it returns 0 or -1 when there is ambiguity. Therefore, the program is correct.
