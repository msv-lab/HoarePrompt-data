Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the pairs communicated by each participant and checks for the common number by eliminating the possibilities based on the pairs received by the other participant. It then checks if there is only one possible common number, in which case it prints that number. If there are multiple possible common numbers or if none can be determined, it prints 0 or -1 accordingly. The program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output based on the given input.
