**Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 12. The pairs of numbers communicated from each participant are distinct and each pair consists of two different numbers. The two sets of pairs do not contradict the statements, and there is a pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.**
