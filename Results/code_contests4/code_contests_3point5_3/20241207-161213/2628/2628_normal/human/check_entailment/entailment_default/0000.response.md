Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads pairs of numbers from two sets of pairs communicated by participants.
- It processes these pairs according to the given constraints to determine if there is a pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.
- The function prints the shared number if such a pair exists, otherwise, it prints 0.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
- The output hints also align with the code and describe the functionality accurately.
