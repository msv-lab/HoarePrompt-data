Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input pairs of numbers communicated by the participants, processes them according to the constraints specified in the problem description, and determines if there is a pair from each set that share exactly one number. It then prints the shared number if it can be deduced with certainty, prints 0 if both participants know the shared number but not the verifier, and prints -1 otherwise.

The program follows the problem description by ensuring that the pairs communicated by each participant are distinct, that there is exactly one number shared between the pairs, and that the verifier can determine the shared number based on the information provided by the participants. The program handles different scenarios where the shared number can be deduced or not, as described in the problem statement.
