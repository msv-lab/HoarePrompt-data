According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time. 
State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
