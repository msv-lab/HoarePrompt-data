Postcondition: ***`j` may need to be adjusted based on specific conditions. Specific operations have been performed on `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1] based on conditions met. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, no changes occur in the variables as the program exits immediately after encountering the `exit()` statement. Otherwise, if the else part is executed, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the unknown value `x1`, `x2` and `y2` remain unknown.***
