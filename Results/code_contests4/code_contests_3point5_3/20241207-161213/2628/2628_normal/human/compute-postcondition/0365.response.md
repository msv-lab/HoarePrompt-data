Example Answer: 
If A is not empty and the sum of the first elements of all A arrays is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of the last Ai[1] where Ai[0] is equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, B is not empty and the next Bi[0] must be equal to 1. In this case, `ans` is assigned the value of Bi[1]. Therefore, the Output State is: If A is not empty and the sum of the first elements of all A arrays is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of the last Ai[1] where Ai[0] is equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, B is not empty and the next Bi[0] must be equal to 1 and `ans` is assigned the value of Bi[1].
Output State: **If A is not empty and the sum of the first elements of all A arrays is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of the last Ai[1] where Ai[0] is equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, B is not empty and the next Bi[0] must be equal to 1 and `ans` is assigned the value of Bi[1]**
