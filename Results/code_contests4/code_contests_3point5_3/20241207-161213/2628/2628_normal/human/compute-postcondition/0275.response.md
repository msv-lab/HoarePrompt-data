Example Answer:
The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further adjustments or calculations are made, and the program ends. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the if-else block, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time are made based on the conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `B[i]; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from the list `a[j]`. `print(-1)` is executed, and the program terminates.
