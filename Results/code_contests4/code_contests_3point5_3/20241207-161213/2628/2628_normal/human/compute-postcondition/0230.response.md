Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i][0]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2` from `A[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then the function prints -1. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, then all variables remain unchanged, and the program prints -1. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, and `B[i][1]` are updated based on the loop execution. If none of the conditions above are met, the program updates the variables accordingly.***
