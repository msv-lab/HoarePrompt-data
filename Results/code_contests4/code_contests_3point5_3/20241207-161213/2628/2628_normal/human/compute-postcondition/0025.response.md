Postcondition: **`x1` and `y1` are assigned values from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from tuple at index `j` in list `b`. The sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`. After not entering the if condition (A[i][1] == 0 or A[i][1] == y1), the program's state ensures that either A[i][1] is equal to 0 or A[i][1] is equal to y1.**
