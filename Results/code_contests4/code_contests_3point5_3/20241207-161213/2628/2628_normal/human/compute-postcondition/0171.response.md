Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, variables `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]` retain their updated values. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits without any further changes. Otherwise, after the if-else block, `j` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`, and the conditions are re-evaluated based on the updated values.***
