Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i][0]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2` from `A[j]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, all variables remain unchanged, and the program prints -1. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, and `y2` are updated according to the loop execution. Additionally, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
