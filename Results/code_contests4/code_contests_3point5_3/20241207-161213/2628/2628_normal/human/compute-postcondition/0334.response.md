Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the program ensures that `i+3`, `j+2`, `x1`, `y1`, `A[i+3][0]`, `A[i+3][1]` are assigned the values of `a[j+1][0]` and `a[j+1][1]` respectively. Additionally, `B[i+3]`, `B[i+2]` are adjusted to prepare for the next loop iteration. `x2` and `y2` are assigned values based on `a[j]`. If `B[i][1] != 0` and `B[i][1] != x1`, the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `a[j+1][0]`.***
