Example Answer:
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `B[i][0]` is unknown, so the output state is: At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2 from `A[j].` `B[i][0]` is adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2 from `A[j].` `B[i][0]` is adjusted accordingly.**
