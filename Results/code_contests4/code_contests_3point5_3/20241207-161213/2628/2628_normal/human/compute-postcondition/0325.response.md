Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+2`, `j+1`, `x1`, `y1`, `A[i+2][0]`, `A[i+2][1]`, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j][0]`, and `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j][1]`, `B[i+2]`, `B[i+1] to execute the loop one more time. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, the loop continues as follows: If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `y1` is assigned to `B[i][1]`. If `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, the loop continues without any changes.***
