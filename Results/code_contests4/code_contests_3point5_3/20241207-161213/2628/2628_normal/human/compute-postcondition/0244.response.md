Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i+1` is adjusted, `j` is adjusted, `x1` is assigned the value of `B[i]`, `y1` is assigned the value of `B[i]`, `m` is adjusted, `A[i+1][0]` is adjusted, `A[i+1][1]` is adjusted, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j][0]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j][1]`, `B[i+1]` is adjusted, for the loop to execute one more time `i+1` is less than `m`, `x1` is assigned the value of `B[i]`, and `y1` is assigned the value of `B[i]`. Additionally, the sets of `B[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal after the if condition is satisfied. Moreover, after the if condition `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, no changes occur in the variables, and -1 is printed. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, and `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1.***
