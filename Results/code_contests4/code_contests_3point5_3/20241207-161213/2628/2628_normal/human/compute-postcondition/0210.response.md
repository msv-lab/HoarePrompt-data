Example Answer:
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2 from `a[j]`. `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1.
