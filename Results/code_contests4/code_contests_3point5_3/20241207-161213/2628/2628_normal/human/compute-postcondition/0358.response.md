Postcondition: ***If A is not empty and the sum of the first elements of all A arrays is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of the last Ai[1] where Ai[0] is equal to 1. For the loop to execute, B is not empty. Additionally, after entering the if condition (Bi[0] == 1), the program assigns the value of the last element of the array B to a variable `ans`.***
