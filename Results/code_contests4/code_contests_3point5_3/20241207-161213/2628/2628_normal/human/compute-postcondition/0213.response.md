Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i][0]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1` from the loop execution.***
