Output State: **At the end of the if-else block, variables `j` is incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]` retain their updated values. The value of `A[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`. The specific values assigned to `x2` and `y2` based on `b[j]` are not mentioned, so they remain unchanged. Conditions in the if-else block are re-evaluated and updated accordingly.**
