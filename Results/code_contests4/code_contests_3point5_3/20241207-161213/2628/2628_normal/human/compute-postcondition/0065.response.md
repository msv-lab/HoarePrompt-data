According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- If `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]` are used inside the loop body and are dependent on `j`, they may need to be updated.
- Other variables like `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` may also need to be updated based on the loop body.

State: **for the loop to execute the next time, `j` is incremented by 1, other variables may need to be updated based on the loop body**
