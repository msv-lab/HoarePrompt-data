Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the program ensures that `i+2`, `j+1`, `x1`, `y1`, `A[i+2][0]`, `A[i+2][1]`, `x2` are assigned the values of `a[j][0]` and `a[j][1]`, respectively. Additionally, `B[i+2]`, `B[i+1]` are adjusted to prepare for the next loop iteration. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, the program checks `B[i][1]` for further actions: if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program maintains the current state. In the else part, when `x1` is different from `x2` and `x1` is different from `y2`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, ensuring the necessary adjustments for the next loop iteration are made.***
