Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1, other variables may be updated based on the loop body. `a[i]` and `b[j]` have different sets of elements. The condition (x1 is not equal to x2 and x1 is not equal to y2) is satisfied. If y1 is equal to x2 or y1 is equal to y2, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to y1, then `j` is incremented by 1, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains the same, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned `y1`.***
