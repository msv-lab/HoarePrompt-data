Example Answer:
The list `b` is constructed by extracting tuples from the list `a` based on the index `i * 2` and `i * 2 + 1`, where `m` represents the range limit. The initial state of `a` contains `n` tuples. After running the code, the list `b` will contain tuples extracted from list `a` based on the specified indices. Therefore, the Output State is: The list `a` contains `n` tuples, the list `b` contains tuples extracted from `a` based on the index `i * 2` and `i * 2 + 1` for each `i` in the range `m`.
Output State: **The list `a` contains `n` tuples, the list `b` contains tuples extracted from `a` based on the index `i * 2` and `i * 2 + 1` for each `i` in the range `m`**
