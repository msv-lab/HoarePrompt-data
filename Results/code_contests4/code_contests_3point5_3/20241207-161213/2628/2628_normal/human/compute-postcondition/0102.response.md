Postcondition: ***`j` may have been adjusted based on specific conditions. Specific operations have been performed on `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]` based on conditions met. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, no changes occur in the variables as the program exits immediately after encountering the `exit()` statement. Otherwise, if the else part is executed, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the unknown value `x1`, `x2` and `y2` remain unknown. If `A[i][1] != 0` and `A[i][1] != y1`, then no variables are affected, and the program prints -1. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value `y1`.***
