Output State: **At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i]` will remain the same as the initial state. The sum of `A[i][0]` for all `i` in range `n` will still not be equal to 1 and the sum of `B[i][0]` for all `i` in range `m` will still not be equal to 1.**
