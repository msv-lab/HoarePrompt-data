Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1, specific operations have been performed on `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]`, variables `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` may have been updated based on conditions met, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `b[j]`. If `A[i][1] != 0` and `A[i][1] != x1`, program execution terminates. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1.***
