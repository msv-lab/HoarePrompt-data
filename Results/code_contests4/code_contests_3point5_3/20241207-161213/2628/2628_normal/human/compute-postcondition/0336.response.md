Example Answer:
The `exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program. Since the program has been exited, no further changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, which is: At the end of the loop, the program ensures that `i+3`, `j+2`, `x1`, `y1`, `A[i+3][0]`, `A[i+3][1]` are assigned the values of `a[j+1][0]` and `a[j+1][1]`, respectively. Additionally, `B[i+3]`, `B[i+2]` are adjusted to prepare for the next loop iteration. `x2` and `y2` are assigned values based on `a[j]`.
