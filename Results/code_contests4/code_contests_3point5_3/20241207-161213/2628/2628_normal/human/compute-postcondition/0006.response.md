Example Answer:
Each element in list `B` is initialized with a list containing two zeros, and this process is repeated `m` times. Since the initial state mentions that list `A` is initialized with `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two zeros, we can assume `n` and `m` have specific values. Therefore, the size of list `B` will be `m` and each element will contain two zeros.
Output State: **List `A` is initialized with `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two zeros; List `B` is initialized with `m` lists, where each list contains two zeros.**
