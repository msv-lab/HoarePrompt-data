Example Answer:
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `B[i][0]` is unknown, so after execution, `B[i][0]` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the if-else block, the program adjusts the necessary variables and conditions for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **At the end of the if-else block, the program adjusts the necessary variables and conditions for the loop to execute one more time**
