Postcondition: ***At the end of the if else block, the program ensures that `i+2`, `j+1`, `x1`, `y1`, `A[i+2][0]`, `A[i+2][1]`, `x2` are assigned the values of `a[j][0]` and `a[j][1]`, respectively. Additionally, `B[i+2]`, `B[i+1]` are adjusted to prepare for the next loop iteration. In the if part, if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program maintains the current state. In the else part, the program increments `B[i][0]` by 1 and assigns `B[i][1]` the value of `x1`, while still ensuring the adjustments for the next loop iteration are made.***
