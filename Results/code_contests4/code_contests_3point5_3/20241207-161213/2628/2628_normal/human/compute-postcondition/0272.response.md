According to the code, the loop can execute one more time based on the conditions involving variables `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `B[i]`. At the end of the previous iteration, the necessary adjustments for the next iteration are as follows:

1. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`.
2. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

State: **At the end of the if-else block, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time are made based on the conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `B[i]**.
