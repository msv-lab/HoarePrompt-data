Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j` are integers. The values of `x1` and `y1` are taken from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute the second time, `m` must be greater than 1. The values of `x2` and `y2` are taken from tuple at index `j` in list `b`. The sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program checks if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`. If this condition is met, the program prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, `x1` and `y1` are updated based on the tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` remains 1, `m` remains unchanged, `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged.***
