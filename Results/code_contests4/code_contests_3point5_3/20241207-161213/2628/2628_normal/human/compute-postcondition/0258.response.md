Example Answer:
The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. The values of `a[j]` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact values of `x2` and `y2`. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the if-else block, the program adjusts the necessary variables and conditions for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **At the end of the if-else block, the program adjusts the necessary variables and conditions for the loop to execute one more time.**
