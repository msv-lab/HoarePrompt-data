Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `j` is incremented by 1. Variables `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]` retain their updated values. The specific values assigned to `x2` and `y2` are based on the condition of `b[j]`. The conditions in the if-else block are re-evaluated and updated accordingly. If `set(a[i]) != set(b[j])`, then `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, the program continues based on the updated values of the variables. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits without any further changes. Otherwise, after the if-else block, `j` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`, and the conditions are re-evaluated based on the updated values.***
