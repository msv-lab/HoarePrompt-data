Example Answer: 
`A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, but the value of `x1` is unknown. The value of `A[i][0]` has been previously incremented by 1, and the values of `x2` and `y2` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `A[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned an unknown value `x1`, `x2` and `y2` remain unknown.
Output State: **`A[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned an unknown value `x1`, `x2` and `y2` remain unknown**
