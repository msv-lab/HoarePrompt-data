Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 1. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]` and -1 is printed. If `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, then `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]+1`, `A[i][1]`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]` and the program exits. Otherwise, if `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, then `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]+1`, `A[i][1]=y1`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`.***
