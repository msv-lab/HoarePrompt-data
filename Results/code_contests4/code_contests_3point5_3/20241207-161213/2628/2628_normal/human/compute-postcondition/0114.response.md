Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1. Specific operations have been performed on `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]`. Variables `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` may have been updated based on conditions met. `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then the program exits abruptly. Otherwise, the program continues with the operations described above.***
