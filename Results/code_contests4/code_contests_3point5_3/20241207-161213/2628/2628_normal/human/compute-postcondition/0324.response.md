Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+2`, `j+1`, `x1`, `y1`, `A[i+2][0]`, `A[i+2][1]`, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j][0]`, and `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j][1]`, `B[i+2]`, `B[i+1] to execute the loop one more time. If B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != y1, the program increments `B[i][0]` by 1 and assigns the value of `y1` to `B[i][1]`. If B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == y1, the loop continues without any changes.***
