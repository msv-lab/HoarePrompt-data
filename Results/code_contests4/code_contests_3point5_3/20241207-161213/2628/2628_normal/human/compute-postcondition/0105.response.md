Example Answer:
The code simply prints -1 and does not affect any variables or their values. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, specific operations have been performed on `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]`, variables `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` may have been updated based on conditions met, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `b[j]`**
