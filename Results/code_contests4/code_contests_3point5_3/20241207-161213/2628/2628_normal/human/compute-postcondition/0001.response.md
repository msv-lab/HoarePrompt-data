Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input from the standard input, splits it by space, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The initial state variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12**
