Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, if A is not empty and the sum of the first elements of all A arrays is equal to 1, the variables will remain the same as the initial state. If Ai[0] == 1, the first element of array A will be adjusted based on the loop execution and `ans` will be assigned the value of Ai[1]. Otherwise, the variables will remain the same as the initial state.***
