Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2` from `A[j]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then the variables are left unchanged, and `print(-1)` is executed without affecting the variables. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, `B[i][0]` is adjusted, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
