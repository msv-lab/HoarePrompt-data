Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j`, `x2`, `y2` are integers. The values of `x1` and `y1` are taken from tuple at index `i` in list `A`. The loop will either print -1 and exit, or increment `A[i][0]` and update `A[i][1]` based on certain conditions. The final values of the variables will depend on the specific values in `A` and `b`, as well as the conditions met during the loop execution.**
