Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j` are integers. The values of `x1` and `y1` are taken from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute the second time, `m` must be greater than 1. The values of `x2` and `y2` are taken from tuple at index `j` in list `b`. The sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then print -1. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
