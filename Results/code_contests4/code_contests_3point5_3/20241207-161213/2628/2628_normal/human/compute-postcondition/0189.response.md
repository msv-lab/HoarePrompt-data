Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` will be adjusted based on the loop execution. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the tuple `b[i]`, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`. Additionally, if the set of values in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of values in `a[j]`, then the program state will be as described. Also, `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `y2`***
