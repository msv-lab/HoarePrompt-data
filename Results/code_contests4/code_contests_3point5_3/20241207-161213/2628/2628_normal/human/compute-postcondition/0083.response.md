Example Answer:
`A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned `y1`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned `y1`**
