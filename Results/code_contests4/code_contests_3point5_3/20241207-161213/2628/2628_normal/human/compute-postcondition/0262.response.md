Example Answer:
The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous values of `B[i][1]` and `x1` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the if-else block, the program adjusts the necessary variables and conditions for the loop to execute one more time, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`.
Output State: **At the end of the if-else block, the program adjusts the necessary variables and conditions for the loop to execute one more time, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`**
