Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values extracted from the input using `list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))`. The values of `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 12. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12**
