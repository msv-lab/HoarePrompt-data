Example Answer:
If the condition is met where the sum of the first elements of all A arrays is equal to 1, then `ans` will be assigned the value of the last Ai[1] where Ai[0] is equal to 1. If the loop does not execute, `ans` remains the same as the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` value is either the last Ai[1] where Ai[0] is equal to 1 or remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`ans` value is either the last Ai[1] where Ai[0] is equal to 1 or remains the same as the initial state**
