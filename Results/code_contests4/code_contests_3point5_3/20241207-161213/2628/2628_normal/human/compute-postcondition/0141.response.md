Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, variables `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` have been updated based on the specific conditions met during the last iteration. `i` is incremented by 1. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program does not execute any specific operations. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` and not equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program prints -1. If `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, then `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
