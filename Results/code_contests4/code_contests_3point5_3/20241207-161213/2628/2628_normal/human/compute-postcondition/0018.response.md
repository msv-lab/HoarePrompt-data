Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are assigned values from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from tuple at index `j` in list `b`, the sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal, after not entering the if condition, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1] = x1` is assigned.**
