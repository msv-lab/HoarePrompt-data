The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function processes pairs of numbers from two sets of pairs communicated by participants according to the given constraints. The function will check if the pairs of numbers meet the specified conditions and determine if there is a pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number. The function does not return any value but performs the necessary checks and comparisons based on the provided input constraints.
