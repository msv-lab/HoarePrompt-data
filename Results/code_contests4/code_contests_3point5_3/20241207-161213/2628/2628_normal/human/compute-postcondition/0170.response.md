Postcondition: ***All variables `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]` retain their updated values. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits without any further changes. Otherwise, after the if-else block, `j` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`, and the conditions are re-evaluated based on the updated values. The specific values assigned to `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged as they are not specified in the else part.***
