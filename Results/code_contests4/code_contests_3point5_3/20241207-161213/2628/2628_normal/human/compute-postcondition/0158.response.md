Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, variables `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` have been updated based on specific conditions met during the last iteration. `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 and the conditions in the if-else block should be re-evaluated based on the updated values. `x2` and `y2` are assigned specific values based on `b[j]`. If `set(a[i]) != set(b[j])`, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, no changes are made to the variables. In the else part, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program has terminated with all variables retaining their values from the end of the last iteration. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is updated with the value of `y1`.***
