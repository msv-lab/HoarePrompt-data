Output State: **At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+1`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i+1][0]`, `A[i+1][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i+1]`, and `B[i]`. For the loop to execute, `i+1` is less than `m`, `j` is 0. Additionally, if the set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`. Furthermore, after entering the if condition, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. Moreover, after not entering the if condition, either `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`. `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
