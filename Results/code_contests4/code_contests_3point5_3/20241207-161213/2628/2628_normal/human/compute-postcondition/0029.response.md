Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from tuples at index `i` and `j` respectively in lists `A` and `b`. `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. The sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`. After the if condition (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2), the program ensures that either y1 is equal to x2 or y1 is equal to y2. If A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != y1, the program prints -1. If not entering the if condition (A[i][1] == 0 or A[i][1] == y1), `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value `y1`, and the program ensures that either A[i][1] is equal to 0 or A[i][1] is equal to y1.***
