Example Answer:
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `B[i][0]` is unknown, so after execution, `B[i][0]` will be increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+2`, `j+1`, `x1`, `y1`, `A[i+2][0]`, `A[i+2][1]`, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j][0]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j][1]`, `B[i+2]`, `B[i+1] to execute the loop one more time. `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+2`, `j+1`, `x1`, `y1`, `A[i+2][0]`, `A[i+2][1]`, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j][0]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j][1]`, `B[i+2]`, `B[i+1] to execute the loop one more time. `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1**
