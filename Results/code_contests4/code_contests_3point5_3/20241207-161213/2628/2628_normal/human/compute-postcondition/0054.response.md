Example Answer:
The code prints -1 but does not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same:
Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`.**
