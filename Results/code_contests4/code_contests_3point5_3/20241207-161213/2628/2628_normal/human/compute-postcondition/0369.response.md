Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution. If the loop does not execute, the variables will remain the same as the initial state. Additionally, the sum of `A[i][0]` for all `i` in range `n` is not equal to 1 and the sum of `B[i][0]` for all `i` in range `m` is not equal to 1.***
