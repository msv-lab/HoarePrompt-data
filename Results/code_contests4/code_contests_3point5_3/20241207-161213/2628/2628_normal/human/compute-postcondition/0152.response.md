Example Answer: 
The program encounters the `exit()` statement, which immediately terminates the program. The values of the variables `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, and `y2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. `i` is incremented by 1 but does not affect the output state. The statement `print(-1)` is not executed as the program is terminated before reaching that point.

Output State: **The program has terminated. All variables retain their values from the end of the last iteration.**
