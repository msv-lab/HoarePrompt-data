Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` will be adjusted based on the loop execution. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the tuple `b[i]`, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`. Additionally, if the set of values in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of values in `a[j]`, then the program state will be as described. In the case where `(x1 == x2 or x1 == y2)` is true, the program state will have `x1` equal to either `x2` or `y2`, with no changes to other variables. If `(B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != x1)` is false, then `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. In the else part where `(x1 != x2 and x1 != y2)` is true, the program state will remain the same as described with the additional condition that either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. If `(B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != y1)` is false, then `B[i][1]` is either 0 or equal to `y1`. Furthermore, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `y1`.***
