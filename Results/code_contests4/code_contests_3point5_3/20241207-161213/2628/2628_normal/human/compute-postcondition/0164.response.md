Example Answer:
`A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, where `x1` retains its updated value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the if-else block, variables `j` is incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]` retain their updated values. The specific values assigned to `x2` and `y2` based on `b[j]`. Conditions in the if-else block are re-evaluated and updated accordingly.
