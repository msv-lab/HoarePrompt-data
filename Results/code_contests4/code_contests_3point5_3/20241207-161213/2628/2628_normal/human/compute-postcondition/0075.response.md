Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1, other variables may be updated based on the loop body. `a[i]` and `b[j]` have different sets of elements. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, then `j` is incremented by 1, other variables may be updated based on the loop body. `a[i]` and `b[j]` have different sets of elements. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, `A[i][1]` is equal to `x1` and `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1.***
