Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i][0]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then the variables remain unchanged, and -1 is printed. Otherwise, the variables are updated with new values of `x2` and `y2` from `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
