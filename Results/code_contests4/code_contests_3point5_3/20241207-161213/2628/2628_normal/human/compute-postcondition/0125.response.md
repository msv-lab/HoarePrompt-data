Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, values of `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` have been adjusted based on the loop execution. To prepare for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and the other variables are updated based on specific conditions met during the last iteration. `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`. Additionally, `set(a[i])` is not equal to `set(b[j])`. After entering the if condition, `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`. Moreover, `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`***
