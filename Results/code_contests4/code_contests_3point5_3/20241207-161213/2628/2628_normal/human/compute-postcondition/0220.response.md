Example Answer:
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i][0]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2` from `A[j]`. `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.
