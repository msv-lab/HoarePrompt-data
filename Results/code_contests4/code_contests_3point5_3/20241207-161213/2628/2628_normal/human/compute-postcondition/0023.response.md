Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are assigned values from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from tuple at index `j` in list `b`. The sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`. After entering the if condition (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2), the program's state ensures that either y1 is equal to x2 or y1 is equal to y2. Additionally, A[i][1] is not 0 and A[i][1] is not equal to y1. The program prints -1.**
