Output State: **At the end of the if-else block, variables `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` have been updated based on specific conditions met during the last iteration. `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 and the conditions in the if-else block should be re-evaluated based on the updated values. `x2` and `y2` are assigned specific values based on `b[j]`. The statement `print(-1)` is executed.**
