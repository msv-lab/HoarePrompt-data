According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. Since the loop will execute one more time if `i+1` is less than `m`, we need to adjust the state so that `i+1` is indeed less than `m` for the loop to execute.

State: **At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+1`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i+1][0]`, `A[i+1][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i+1]`, and `B[i]`. For the loop to execute, `i+1` is less than `m`, `j` is 0**
