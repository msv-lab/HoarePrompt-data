Example Answer:
`A[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`, where `x1` is the value of `b[j]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0] + 1`, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `b[j]`, `j`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`.
Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0] + 1`, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `b[j]`, `j`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`**
