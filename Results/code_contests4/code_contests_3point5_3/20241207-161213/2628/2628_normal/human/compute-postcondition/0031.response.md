Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]` are integers. The values of `x1` and `y1` are taken from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0. The values of `x2` and `y2` are taken from tuple at index `j` in list `b`. The sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal. After the if condition, if `A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != x1`, print(-1) is executed, and the program exits immediately after. If the else part is executed, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from tuple at index `j` in list `b`, the sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal. Additionally, after not entering the if condition, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1] = x1` is assigned. If not entering the else part, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from tuple at index `j` in list `b`, the sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal. Additionally, after not entering the if condition, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1] = x1` is assigned.***
