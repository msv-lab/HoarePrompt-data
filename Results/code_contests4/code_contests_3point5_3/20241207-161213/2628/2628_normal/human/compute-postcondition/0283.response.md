Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time are made based on the conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `B[i]`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from the list `a[j]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, `print(-1)` is executed. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1.***
