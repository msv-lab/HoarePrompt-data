Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+1`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i+1][0]`, `A[i+1][1]`, `x2` is assigned the first element of list `a` and `y2` is assigned the second element of list `a`, `B[i+1]`, and `B[i]`. For the loop to execute, `i+1` is less than `m`, `j` is 0. Additionally, if the set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`. After entering the if condition, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. Moreover, `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `x1`***
