Output State: **At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+1`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i+1][0]`, `A[i+1][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i+1]`, and `B[i]`. The loop will execute one more time if `i+1` is less than `m`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are reassigned based on the conditions in the loop. The sets of `B[i]` and `a[j]` are compared, and based on the conditions, either `B[i][1]` is updated or -1 is printed. After all iterations of the loop have executed, the final values of the variables will depend on the specific conditions met during each iteration.**
