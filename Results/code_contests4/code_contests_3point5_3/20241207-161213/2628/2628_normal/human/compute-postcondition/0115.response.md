Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1. Specific operations have been performed on `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]`. Variables `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` may have been updated based on conditions met. `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `b[j]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then the program continues. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits abruptly.***
