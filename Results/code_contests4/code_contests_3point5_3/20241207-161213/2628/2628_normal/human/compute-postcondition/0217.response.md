Example Answer:
The values of `x2` and `y2` are updated with the values stored in `A[j]`. The previous values of `x2` and `y2` are unknown, so after execution, the new values of `x2` and `y2` are set based on the values stored in `A[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i][0]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2` from `A[j]`.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i][0]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2` from `A[j]`.**
