Example Answer: 
`x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`. The values of `b[i]` are not known from the initial state provided. Therefore, the output state is: At the end of the loop, `i+1`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i+1][0]`, `A[i+1][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i+1]` are adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `i+1` must be less than `m`, and `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `i+1`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i+1][0]`, `A[i+1][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i+1]` are adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `i+1` must be less than `m`, and `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`**
