Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, the program adjusts `i+1`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i+1][0]`, `A[i+1][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i+1]`, and `B[i]`. The loop will execute one more time if `i+1` is less than `m`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are reassigned. Additionally, the sets of `B[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal after the if condition is satisfied. If `x1 == x2` or `x1 == y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, no changes occur in the variables, and -1 is printed. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, and `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. In the else part, the condition `(x1 != x2 and x1 != y2)` holds true, and after the if condition, `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. Moreover, the negation of the if condition is also true: `(B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == y1)`. Lastly, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
