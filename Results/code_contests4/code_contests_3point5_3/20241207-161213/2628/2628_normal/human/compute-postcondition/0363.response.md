Postcondition: ***If A is not empty and the sum of the first elements of all A arrays is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of the last Ai[1] where Ai[0] is equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, B is not empty and the next Bi[0] must be equal to 1. If Bi[0] == 1, and the conditions are met, `ans` is assigned the value of the last `Bi[1]` where `Bi[0]` is equal to 1.***
