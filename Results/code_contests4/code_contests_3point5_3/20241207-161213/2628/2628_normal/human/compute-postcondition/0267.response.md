Example Answer:
The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `B[i][0]` is unknown. `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.
Output State: **`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`**
