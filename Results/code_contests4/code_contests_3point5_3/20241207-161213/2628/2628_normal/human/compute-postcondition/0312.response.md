Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the program adjusts `i+1`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i+1][0]`, `A[i+1][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i+1]`, `B[i]`. For the loop to execute, `i+1` is less than `m`, `j` is 0. If the set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`, then either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, then the program prints -1. If `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`. After the else condition, if `(y1 == x2 or y1 == y2)` is satisfied, then `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, then the state includes `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`. Otherwise, the program increments `B[i][0]` by 1 and assigns `B[i][1]` the value of `y1`.***
