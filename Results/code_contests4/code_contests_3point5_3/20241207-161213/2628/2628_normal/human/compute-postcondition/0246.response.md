Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i+1` is adjusted, `j` is adjusted, `x1` is assigned the value of `B[i]`, `y1` is assigned the value of `B[i]`, `m` is adjusted, `A[i+1][0]` is adjusted, `A[i+1][1]` is adjusted, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j][0]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j][1]`, `B[i+1]` is adjusted, for the loop to execute one more time `i+1` is less than `m`, `x1` is assigned the value of `B[i]`, and `y1` is assigned the value of `B[i]`. Additionally, the sets of `B[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal after the if condition is satisfied. The condition (x1 is not equal to x2 and x1 is not equal to y2) is true. Also, after the if condition `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`***
