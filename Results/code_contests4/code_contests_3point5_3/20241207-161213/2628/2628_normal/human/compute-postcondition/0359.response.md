Example Answer:
If the condition `Bi[0] == 1` is met and variable `B` is not empty, then `ans` will be assigned the value of the last element of array `B`. The previous values of variables are not mentioned, so the output state is: If the condition is met, `ans` is assigned the value of the last element of array `B`.
Output State: **If the condition is met, `ans` is assigned the value of the last element of array `B`**
