Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution. If the loop does not execute, the variables will remain the same as the initial state. If the sum of the first elements of all A arrays is equal to 1 or the sum of the first elements of all B arrays is equal to 1, then the variables will be adjusted according to the loop execution after entering the if condition.***
