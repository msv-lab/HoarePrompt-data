Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, where `x1` is a new value calculated based on the loop execution. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` will be adjusted based on the loop execution with new values of `x2` and `y2 from `A[j]`. `B[i][0]` is adjusted accordingly, and now `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.
