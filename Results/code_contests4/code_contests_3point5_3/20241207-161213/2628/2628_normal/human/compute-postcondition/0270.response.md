Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, the necessary adjustments are made for the loop to execute one more time. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
