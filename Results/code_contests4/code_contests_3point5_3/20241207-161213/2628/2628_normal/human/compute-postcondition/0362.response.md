Example Answer:
If the conditions are met, `ans` is assigned the value of the last `Bi[1]`, where `Bi[0]` is equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `B` must not be empty and the next `Bi[0]` must be equal to 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **If the conditions are met, `ans` is assigned the value of the last `Bi[1]`, where `Bi[0]` is equal to 1.**
