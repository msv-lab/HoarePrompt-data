Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i]` will be adjusted based on the loop execution. If the loop does not execute, the variables will remain the same as the initial state. If sum((A[i][0] for i in range(n))) == 1 or sum((B[i][0] for i in range(m))) == 1, then `ans` value will be the last `A[i][1]` where `A[i][0]` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `ans` will remain the same as the initial state. If the condition is not met, the sum of `A[i][0]` for all `i` in range `n` will still not be equal to 1 and the sum of `B[i][0]` for all `i` in range `m` will still not be equal to 1.***
