Example Answer:
`x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j`, `x2`, `y2` are adjusted based on the loop execution for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: the values of `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j`, `x2`, `y2` are adjusted based on the loop execution for the next iteration.
Output State: **the values of `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `j`, `x2`, `y2` are adjusted based on the loop execution for the next iteration**
