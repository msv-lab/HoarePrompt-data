Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are assigned values from tuple at index `i` in list `A`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from tuple at index `j` in list `b`. The sets of elements in tuple at index `i` in list `A` and tuple at index `j` in list `b` are not equal.***
