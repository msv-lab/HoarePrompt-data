Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value at the index determined by the user input minus 10 in the list [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Since the user input is restricted to be between 1 and 25, the valid indices in the list are between 1 and 15. Therefore, the output will be the value at that index in the list. 
Output State: **Output will be the value at the index in the list determined by the user input.**
