#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 25.**
def func():
    print[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0][input() - 10]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. When called, it prints a value from a predefined list based on user input. The function does not have a specific output, and the annotations do not align with the actual functionality of the code.
