Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program is a simple lookup table that directly maps the input to the corresponding output. The values in the list represent the number of ways to get the second card to achieve the required sum of points. The program correctly handles all possible cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 25) and provides the correct output for each input. Since the program produces the expected output for all possible inputs, it can be considered correct.
