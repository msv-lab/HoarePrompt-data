According to the code, the loop will execute as long as N is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the values assigned to N, M, C, and B do not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to N is greater than or equal to 1, M and C are initialized, B is assigned a map object with integer values, and ans is 0.
State: **N is greater than or equal to 1, M is initialized, C is initialized, B is assigned a map object with integer values, ans is 0**
