Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for N, M, and C, as well as arrays B and A. It calculates the sum of products of elements in arrays A and B, adds C to the sum, and increments a counter if the result is greater than 0. Finally, it prints the total count of such occurrences. The function does not accept any parameters and operates without input arguments.**
