Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values for N, M, C, B, and A.
- It then iterates through each code and calculates the sum of A_{ij} * B_i for each code.
- If the sum plus C is greater than 0, it increments the counter by 1.
- Finally, it prints the total number of codes that correctly solve the problem.
- The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases as described.
