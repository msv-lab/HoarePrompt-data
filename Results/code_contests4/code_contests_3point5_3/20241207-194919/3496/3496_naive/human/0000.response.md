Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. 
A potential case where the program fails is when there are alternating postcards and photos in the input string. For example, if the input is "CPCPCPCP", the program would output 4, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 5 as Polycarpus needs to visit the closet once after taking the first photo.
