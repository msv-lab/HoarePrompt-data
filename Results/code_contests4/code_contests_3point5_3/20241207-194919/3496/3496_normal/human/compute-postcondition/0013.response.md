Postcondition: ***count is 0, hand is a list with the appended element, n is greater than 0, i is 0, hand has a length greater than 0 and less than 5, str is a string. If the ith element of str is equal to the last element of hand and the length of hand is less than 5, the function updates count to 0 and adds the element to hand. Otherwise, count is incremented by 1, and hand contains the element at index i of the str list.***
