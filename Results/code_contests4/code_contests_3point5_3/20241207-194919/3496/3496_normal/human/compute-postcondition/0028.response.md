Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `hand` contains the element at index 2 of the string `str`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and the length of `hand` is either 2 or 3. If `hand.__len__() == 0`, then the element at index 2 of the string `str` is appended to `hand`, and the length of `hand` becomes 3. If `hand.__len__() > 0` and `str[i] == hand[-1]` and `hand.__len__() < 5`, then the length of `hand` becomes 3. Otherwise, `count` becomes 1, the length of `hand` remains 2, and `hand` becomes a list containing the element at index 2 of the string `str`.***
