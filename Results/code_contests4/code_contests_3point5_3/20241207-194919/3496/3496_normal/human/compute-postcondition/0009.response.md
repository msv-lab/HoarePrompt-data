The code `hand.append(str[i])` appends the ith element of the string `str` to the list `hand`. Since the ith element of `str` is equal to the last element of `hand`, the value will be added to the end of the list `hand`.

Since the length of `hand` was initially less than 5 and now an element has been added, the length of `hand` will be increased by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: count is 0, hand is a list containing the appended element, n is greater than 0, i is 0, hand has a length greater than 0 and less than 5, str is a string, the ith element of str is equal to the last element of hand.
Output State: **count is 0, hand is a list containing the appended element, n is greater than 0, i is 0, hand has a length greater than 0 and less than 5, str is a string, the ith element of str is equal to the last element of hand**.
