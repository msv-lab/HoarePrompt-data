Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `hand` is a list containing the element at index `i` of the string `str`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the length of `hand` is 1 if hand.__len__() == 0. If the ith element of str is equal to the last element of hand and the length of hand is less than 5, the function updates count to 0 and adds the element to hand. Otherwise, count is incremented by 1, and hand contains the element at index i of the str list.***
