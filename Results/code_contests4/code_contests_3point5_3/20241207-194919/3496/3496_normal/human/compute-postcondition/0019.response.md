The code snippet `hand = [str[i]]` assigns a list containing the element at index `i` of the string `str` to the variable `hand`. Since `i` is 1, the element at index 1 of the string `str` is assigned to `hand`. The length of `hand` is now 1.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `hand` contains the element at index 1 of the string `str`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the length of `hand` is 1**.
