Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `hand` is a list. If `hand` is empty, then `count` is 0, `hand` contains the element at index `i+1` of the string `str`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `hand` has the element at index `i` of the string `str` appended to it, and the length of `hand` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `str[i]` matches the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `count` remains 0, `hand` contains the element at index `i+1` and `str[i]` added to it, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the length of `hand` becomes 2. If the condition is not met, `count` becomes 1, `hand` contains the element at index 1 of the string `str`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the length of `hand` is 1.***
