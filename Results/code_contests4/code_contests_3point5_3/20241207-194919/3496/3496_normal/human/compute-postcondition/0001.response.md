Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the length of the input string `str`, where `str` consists of only "C" and "P" characters. The value of `n` will be the number of characters in the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: The input string consists of only "C" and "P" characters, `n` is the length of the input string.
Output State: **The input string consists of only "C" and "P" characters, `n` is the length of the input string**
