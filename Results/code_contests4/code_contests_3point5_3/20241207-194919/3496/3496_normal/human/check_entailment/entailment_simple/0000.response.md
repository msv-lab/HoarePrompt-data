Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description correctly. It iterates through the input string, keeping track of the consecutive objects of the same type in the `hand` list. If a different type of object is encountered or the `hand` list reaches a length of 5, it increments the `count` variable to represent a visit to the closet. The final output is the `count` plus 1 if there are remaining objects in the `hand` list. This logic correctly determines the minimum number of times Polycarpus needs to visit the closet, as described in the problem.
