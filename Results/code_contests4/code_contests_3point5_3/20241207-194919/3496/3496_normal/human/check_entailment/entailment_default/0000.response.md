Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code fails to handle the scenario where the last sequence of objects is less than 5 in length. For example, if the input string is "CCCCC", the code will only visit the closet once, but the correct output should be 1. The output hints do not provide an example for this case, but it is a valid scenario according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
