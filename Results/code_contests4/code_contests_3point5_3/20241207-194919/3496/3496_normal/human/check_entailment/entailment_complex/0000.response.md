Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads a string input consisting of only "C" and "P" characters, iterates through the string while keeping track of consecutive sequences of characters that are the same and less than 5 in length. It counts the number of times Polycarpus needs to visit the closet based on the conditions described in the problem. The final output is the minimum number of times Polycarpus has to visit the closet, which matches the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
