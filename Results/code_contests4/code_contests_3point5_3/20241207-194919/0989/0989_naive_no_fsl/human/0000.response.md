Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It determines the smallest integer number X strictly greater than A that is periodic with length L. The logic in the code handles the different scenarios such as when the length of the input number is not divisible by the period length, when the initial digits are all 9s, and when the digits need to be incremented to find the smallest number. Overall, the code covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
