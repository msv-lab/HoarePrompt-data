Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values for the length of the period and the integer number A.
- It then checks if the length of the input number is divisible by the period length.
- If it is not divisible, it constructs the smallest periodic number greater than A with the given period length by repeating the smallest possible number like '100', '1000', etc.
- If the input number starts with '9' for the length of the period, it constructs the periodic number accordingly.
- If neither of the above conditions are met, it constructs the smallest periodic number greater than A with the given period length by incrementing the first non-'9' digit and repeating accordingly.

Since the program handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and constructs the correct periodic number as required, the correctness of the program is True.
