Output State: **A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string. The length of s is divisible by n. The first n characters of s are all '9', ans1 is a string consisting of '9' repeated len(s) times, ans2 is a string consisting of '1' followed by '0' repeated n times, the output is either ans1 if ans1 is greater than s, otherwise, it is '10' repeated len(s) // n times.**
