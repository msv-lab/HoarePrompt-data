Example Answer:
The variable `tem` is assigned the string '1' followed by '0' repeated (n - 1) times. Since the value of n is not given in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`, but it will consist of '1' followed by n - 1 zeros. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string. The remainder of the division of the length of s by n is not 0, `tem` is a string consisting of '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros.**
