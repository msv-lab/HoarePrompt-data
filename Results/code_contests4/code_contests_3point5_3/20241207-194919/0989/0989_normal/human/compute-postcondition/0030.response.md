Postcondition: ***A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string. If the length of s is not divisible by n, then `tem` is a string consisting of '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros, and the repeated string s. If the length of s is divisible by n, and the first n characters of s are all '9', then ans1 is a string consisting of '9' repeated len(s) times, ans2 is a string consisting of '1' followed by '0' repeated n times, and the output is either ans1 if ans1 is greater than s, otherwise, it is '10' repeated len(s) // n times. Otherwise, after the loop execution, A, L, n, s, ans1 are positive integers, tem is a list containing the first n characters of s with a specific pattern modified, i is 0, and ans2 is a string representing the concatenation of the first n characters of s repeated (len(s) // n) times.***
