The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It works with pre-defined positive integers `A` and `L`. The positive integer `A` ranges from 1 to 10^100000, and the positive integer `L` ranges from 1 to 10^5. The function does not return any specific output as the expected functionality is not provided.
