Output State: **`A`, `L`, `n`, `s`, `ans1` are positive integers, `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s` with the `i-th` element updated to '0', `i` is `n - 2` and the loop can execute one more time. If `tem[i]` is not equal to '9', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
