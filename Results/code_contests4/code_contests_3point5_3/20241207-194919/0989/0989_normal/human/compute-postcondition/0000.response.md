Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. `s` is assigned the value `stdin.readline().strip()`, where `stdin.readline()` reads a line from standard input and `strip()` removes any leading and trailing whitespaces. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string.
Output State: **A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string**
