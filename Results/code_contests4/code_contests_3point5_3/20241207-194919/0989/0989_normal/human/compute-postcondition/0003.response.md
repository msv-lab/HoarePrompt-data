Example Answer:
The string `tem` is created with '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros. Then the string `s` is repeated (len(s) // n + 1) times. Since the remainder of the division of the length of s by n is not 0, the last repetition may be a partial repetition. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string, `tem` is a string consisting of '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros, and the repeated string s.
Output State: **A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string, `tem` is a string consisting of '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros, and the repeated string s**
