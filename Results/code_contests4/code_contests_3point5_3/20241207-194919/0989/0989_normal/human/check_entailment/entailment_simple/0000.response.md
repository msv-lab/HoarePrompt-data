Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It first reads the period length `n` and the integer `s` from the input. Then it checks if the length of `s` is divisible by `n`. If it is not, it constructs the smallest periodic number greater than `s` with length `n`. If the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, it handles the case where the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9' separately and constructs the smallest periodic number greater than `s` with length `n`.

The program correctly identifies the smallest integer number `X` strictly greater than `A` that is periodic with length `L` as required by the problem description.
