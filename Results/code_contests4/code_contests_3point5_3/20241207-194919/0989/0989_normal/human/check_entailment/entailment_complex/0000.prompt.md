You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Alice became interested in periods of integer numbers. We say positive X integer number is periodic with length L if there exists positive integer number P with L digits such that X can be written as PPPP…P. For example:

X = 123123123 is periodic number with length L = 3 and L = 9

X = 42424242 is periodic number with length L = 2,L = 4 and L = 8

X = 12345 is periodic number with length L = 5

For given positive period length L and positive integer number A, Alice wants to find smallest integer number X strictly greater than A that is periodic with length L.

Input

First line contains one positive integer number L \ (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5) representing length of the period. Second line contains one positive integer number A \ (1 ≤ A ≤ 10^{100 000}).

Output

One positive integer number representing smallest positive number that is periodic with length L and is greater than A.

Examples

Input


3
123456


Output


124124


Input


3
12345


Output


100100

Note

In first example 124124 is the smallest number greater than 123456 that can be written with period L = 3 (P = 124).

In the second example 100100 is the smallest number greater than 12345 with period L = 3 (P=100)
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a positive integer and L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000.**
def func():
    n, s = int(input()), stdin.readline().strip()
    if (len(s) % n) :
        tem = '1' + '0' * (n - 1)
        print(tem * (len(s) // n + 1))
    else :
        if (s[:n] == '9' * n) :
            ans1, ans2 = '9' * len(s), '1' + '0' * n
            print(ans1 if ans1 > s else ans2 * (len(s) // n))
        else :
            ans1, tem = s[:n] * (len(s) // n), list(s[:n])
            for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if tem[i] != '9':
                    tem[i] = str(int(tem[i]) + 1)
                    break
                
                tem[i] = '0'
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, `A`, `L`, `n`, `s`, `ans1` are positive integers, `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s` with a specific pattern modified, `i` is 0
            ans2 = ''.join(tem) * (len(s) // n)
            print(ans1 if ans1 > s else ans2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string. The length of s is divisible by n. If the first n characters of s are all '9', then ans1 is a string consisting of '9' repeated len(s) times, ans2 is a string consisting of '1' followed by '0' repeated n times, and the output is either ans1 if ans1 is greater than s, otherwise, it is '10' repeated len(s) // n times. Otherwise, after the loop execution, `A`, `L`, `n`, `s`, `ans1` are positive integers, `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s` with a specific pattern modified, `i` is 0, and `ans2` is a string representing the concatenation of the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `(len(s) // n)` times.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *A is a positive integer, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string. If the length of s is not divisible by n, then `tem` is a string consisting of '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros, and the repeated string s. If the length of s is divisible by n, and the first n characters of s are all '9', then ans1 is a string consisting of '9' repeated len(s) times, ans2 is a string consisting of '1' followed by '0' repeated n times, and the output is either ans1 if ans1 is greater than s, otherwise, it is '10' repeated len(s) // n times. Otherwise, after the loop execution, A, L, n, s, ans1 are positive integers, tem is a list containing the first n characters of s with a specific pattern modified, i is 0, and ans2 is a string representing the concatenation of the first n characters of s repeated (len(s) // n) times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` as input. It then performs different operations based on the length of `s` and the contents of the first `n` characters of `s`. If the length of `s` is not divisible by `n`, it creates a specific string pattern and prints it. If the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9', it generates specific strings `ans1` and `ans2` and prints the larger one. Otherwise, it modifies the first `n` characters of `s` based on a certain pattern, generates strings `ans1` and `ans2`, and prints the larger one. The function does not have a return value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
