Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the final coordinates of both children after T seconds and determines if "it" can catch the other child based on their positions. It considers all possible cases where the children move optimally and makes the decision accordingly. The logic in the `func_1` function correctly handles the scenarios where the children are moving towards each other or away from each other. The output is based on whether the coordinates will overlap within T seconds. The program passes all the provided test cases and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
