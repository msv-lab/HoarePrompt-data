Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the final coordinates of both children after T seconds and then compares them to determine if "it" can catch the other child. It handles the cases where A < B and A > B correctly, ensuring that the optimal movement of both children is taken into account. The program covers all the constraints and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
