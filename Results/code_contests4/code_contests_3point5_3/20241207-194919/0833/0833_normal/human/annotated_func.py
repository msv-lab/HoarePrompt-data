#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A,B <= 10^9, 1 <= V,W <= 10^9, 1 <= T <= 10^9, and A != B.**
def func_1(A, B, V, W, T):
    la = A + V * T
    lb = B + W * T
    if (A < B) :
        return la >= lb
        #The program returns whether the result of A + V * T is greater than or equal to the result of B + W * T, given that A is less than B
    else :
        return lb >= la
        #The program returns True if lb is greater than or equal to la, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts integer parameters A, B, V, W, and T. If A is less than B, it calculates A + V * T and B + W * T, then returns whether A + V * T is greater than or equal to B + W * T. If A is not less than B, it compares lb and la and returns True if lb is greater than or equal to la; otherwise, it returns False. The function follows the postconditions for both cases.
