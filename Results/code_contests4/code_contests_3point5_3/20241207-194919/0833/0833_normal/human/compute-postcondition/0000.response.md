Example Answer:
`la` is assigned the value of `A + V * T`, where `A`, `V`, and `T` are integers. The previous values of `A`, `V`, and `T` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A,B <= 10^9, 1 <= V,W <= 10^9, 1 <= T <= 10^9, and A != B; la is assigned the result of A + V * T.
Output State: **A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A,B <= 10^9, 1 <= V,W <= 10^9, 1 <= T <= 10^9, and A != B; la is assigned the result of A + V * T**.
