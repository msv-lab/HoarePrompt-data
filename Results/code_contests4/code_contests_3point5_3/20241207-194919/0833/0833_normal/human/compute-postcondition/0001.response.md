Example Answer:
`la` is assigned the result of A + V * T, where A, V, and T are integers. Similarly, `lb` is assigned the result of B + W * T, where B, W, and T are integers. The values of A, B, V, W, and T satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A,B <= 10^9, 1 <= V,W <= 10^9, 1 <= T <= 10^9, and A != B; la is assigned the result of A + V * T, lb is assigned the result of B + W * T.
Output State: **A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A,B <= 10^9, 1 <= V,W <= 10^9, 1 <= T <= 10^9, and A != B; la is assigned the result of A + V * T, lb is assigned the result of B + W * T**
