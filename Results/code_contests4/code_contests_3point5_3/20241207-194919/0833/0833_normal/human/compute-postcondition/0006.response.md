The function `func_1` accepts parameters `A`, `B`, `V`, `W`, and `T`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints provided. 

Case 1: If A is less than B, the function calculates the results of A + V * T and B + W * T, and then returns whether the result of A + V * T is greater than or equal to the result of B + W * T.

Case 2: If A is not less than B, the function compares lb and la and returns True if lb is greater than or equal to la, otherwise it returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integer parameters A, B, V, W, and T, and based on the conditions specified, return the respective comparisons as described in Case 1 and Case 2.
