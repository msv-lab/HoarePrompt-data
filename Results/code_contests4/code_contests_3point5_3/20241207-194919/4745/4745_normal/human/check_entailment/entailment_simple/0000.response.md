Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the list of heights from right to left, checking if each height is greater than the last minimum height encountered. If the height is greater, it calculates the difference and ensures it is not greater than 1. It then updates the last minimum height seen. If at any point a height is found that violates the non-decreasing condition, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' at the end. This approach ensures that the heights are non-decreasing from left to right as required by the problem description.
