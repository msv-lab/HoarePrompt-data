Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code iterates through the list of heights and checks if any element is greater than the previous minimum height. If such an element is found and the difference between them is greater than 1, it prints 'No' and exits. If no such element is found, it prints 'Yes'. This logic ensures that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
