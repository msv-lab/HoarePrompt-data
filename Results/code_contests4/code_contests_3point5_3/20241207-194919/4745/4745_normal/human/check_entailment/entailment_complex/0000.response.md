Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the list of heights and checks if any height is greater than the previous minimum height. If such a height is found and the difference between them is greater than 1, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This approach ensures that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right as required by the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
