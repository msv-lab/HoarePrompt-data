Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the last element of `arr`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and `d` represents the difference between the element at index `i` in `arr` and `last`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, and the difference `d` is greater than 1, then the program prints 'No'.***
