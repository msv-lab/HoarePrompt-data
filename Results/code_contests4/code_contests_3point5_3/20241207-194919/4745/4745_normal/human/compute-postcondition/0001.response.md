Example Answer:
`arr` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the input values from `stdin.readline().split()`. The values of `arr` depend on the input provided, which is not known beforehand. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer input read from the standard input, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input read from the standard input, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values**
