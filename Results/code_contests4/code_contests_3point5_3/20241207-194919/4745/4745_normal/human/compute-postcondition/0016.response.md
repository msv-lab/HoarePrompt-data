Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the minimum value between the current `last` and the element at index `n-2` in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `d` represents the difference between the element at index `n-2` in `arr` and the updated `last`. If `d` is greater than 1, 'No' is printed.***
