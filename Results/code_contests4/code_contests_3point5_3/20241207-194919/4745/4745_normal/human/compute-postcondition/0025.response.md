Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `last` is the minimum value between the current `last` and the element at index `n-3` in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, and `d` represents the difference between the element at index `n-2` in `arr` and the updated `last`. If `arr[i]` is greater than the updated `last` and `d` is greater than 1, the program prints 'No'.**
