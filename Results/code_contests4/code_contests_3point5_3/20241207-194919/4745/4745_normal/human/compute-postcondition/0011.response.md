Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the minimum value between the current `last` and the element at index `i` in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and `d` represents the difference between the element at index `i` in `arr` and the updated `last`. If `arr[i]` is greater than the updated `last`, and the updated difference `d` is greater than 1, then the program prints 'No'.**
