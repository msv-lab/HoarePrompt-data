Example Answer:
The value of `last` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `last` and the element at index `n-2` in `arr`. The value of `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and `d` represents the difference between the element at index `n-2` in `arr` and the updated `last`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, then if `d` is greater than 1, 'No' is printed. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the updated minimum value, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `d` represents the difference between the element at index `n-2` in `arr` and the updated `last`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the updated minimum value, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `d` represents the difference between the element at index `n-2` in `arr` and the updated `last`**
