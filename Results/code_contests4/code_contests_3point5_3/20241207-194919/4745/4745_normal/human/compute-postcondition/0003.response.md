According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. The loop iterates from `n - 1` to 0 in reverse order. Before the loop starts, `last` is the last element of the list `arr` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `last` is equal to the last element of the list `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n - 1`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the last element of the list `arr`, `i` is equal to `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time**
