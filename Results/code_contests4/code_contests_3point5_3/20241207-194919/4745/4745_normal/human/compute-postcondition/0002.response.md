Example Answer: 
`last` is assigned the value of `arr[n - 1]`. The value of `n` is an integer input, and `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values. If `n` is the length of the `arr`, then `last` will be the last element of the list `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input read from the standard input, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the last element of the list `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input read from the standard input, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the last element of the list `arr`**
