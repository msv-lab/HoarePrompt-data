Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the input values, `last` is the last element of the list `arr`, `i` is equal to `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time, `d` is equal to the difference between the element at index `i` in `arr` and `last`. Additionally, when the if condition is met, `d` is greater than 1***
