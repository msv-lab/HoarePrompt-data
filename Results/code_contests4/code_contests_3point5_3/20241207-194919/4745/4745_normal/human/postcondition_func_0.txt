The function `func` reads an integer `n` followed by a list of integers. It then iterates through the list checking if any element is greater than the previous minimum element. If such an element is found and the difference between them is greater than 1, it prints 'No' and exits. If no such element is found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
