Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. It iterates through the array of heights in reverse order, checking if the current height is greater than the last height encountered. If so, it calculates the difference and ensures that it is not greater than 1. If the conditions are met for all heights, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
