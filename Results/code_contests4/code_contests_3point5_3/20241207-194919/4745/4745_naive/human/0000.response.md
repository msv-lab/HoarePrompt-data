Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly determines if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. It iterates through the squares from right to left, checking if the current square height is greater than the last height. If it is, it calculates the difference and if the difference is greater than 1, it immediately prints 'No'. Otherwise, it updates the last height to be the minimum of the current and last height. If the program reaches the end without printing 'No', it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to perform the operations. 

We can see that for all the given test cases, the program is able to correctly determine if the heights of the squares can be made non-decreasing. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
