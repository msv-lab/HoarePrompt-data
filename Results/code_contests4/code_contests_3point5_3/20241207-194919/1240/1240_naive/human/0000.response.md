Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes a path as input and normalizes it by removing any extra '/' characters. It correctly handles the case where multiple '/' characters are present in the path by only outputting a single '/' character. It also correctly handles paths that start with multiple '/' characters. The program terminates when it encounters a newline character. The program ensures that the normalized path contains the smallest possible number of '/' characters as per the problem description. Overall, the program functions as described in the problem statement.
