Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input path character by character, skipping consecutive '/' characters except for the first one. It then outputs the characters of the path with a single '/' between them, resulting in a normalized path. The program correctly handles the case where the input path ends with a '/' character. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and always transforms the given path to the normalized form.
