You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The new operating system BerOS has a nice feature. It is possible to use any number of characters '/' as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional '/'. For example, strings //usr///local//nginx/sbin// and /usr/local/nginx///sbin are equivalent. The character '/' (or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character '/'.

A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters '/'.

Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.

Input

The first line of the input contains only lowercase Latin letters and character '/' â€” the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character '/'. The length of the given line is no more than 100 characters, it is not empty.

Output

The path in normalized form.

Examples

Input

//usr///local//nginx/sbin


Output

/usr/local/nginx/sbin
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input path is a string containing lowercase Latin letters and character '/', starting with at least one character '/'. The length of the path is no more than 100 characters and is not empty.**
def func_1():
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    while True:
        a = sys.stdin.read(1)
        
        if a == '/':
            if flag == 0:
                flag = 1
            else:
                pass
        elif a == '\n':
            break
        else:
            if flag == 1:
                sys.stdout.write('/')
            count += 1
            sys.stdout.write(a)
            flag = 0
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The loop will continue indefinitely, reading input characters one at a time. If the character is '/', the flag will be set to 1. If the character is '\n', the loop will break. If the character is neither '/' nor '\n', the count will be updated and the character will be output. After the loop finishes, 'count' holds the total count of characters that were not '/' and were not part of the newline character. 'flag' will be 0.
    if (not count) :
        sys.stdout.write('/')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *The loop reads input characters indefinitely. If the character is '/', the flag is set to 1. If the character is '\n', the loop breaks. If the character is neither '/' nor '\n', the count is updated and the character is output. After the loop finishes, 'count' holds the total count of characters that were not '/' and were not part of the newline character. If count is 0, '/' is written to the standard output. 'flag' is set to 1 if '/' was encountered during the loop, otherwise 'flag' remains 0.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
