Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The code does not handle the case where there are multiple consecutive '/' characters in the input path. For example, if the input is "//usr///local//nginx/sbin", the code will not remove the extra consecutive '/' characters.
2. The code does not handle the case where the input path ends with a '/' character. According to the problem description, the character '/' at the end of the path is required only in the case of the path to the root directory. If the input is "/usr/local/nginx///sbin/", the code will not remove the extra '/' at the end of the path.
