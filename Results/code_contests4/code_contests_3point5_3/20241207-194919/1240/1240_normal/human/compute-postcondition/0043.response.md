Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1 on each iteration of the loop. The loop will continue indefinitely, so `count` will keep increasing. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will continue indefinitely, 'a' is read from the standard input one character at a time. If flag is equal to 1, '/' is continuously written to the standard output, `count` keeps increasing.
Output State: **The loop will continue indefinitely, 'a' is read from the standard input one character at a time. If flag is equal to 1, '/' is continuously written to the standard output, `count` keeps increasing**
