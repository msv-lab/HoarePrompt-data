Postcondition: ***The input path is a string containing lowercase Latin letters and character '/'; count and flag are updated based on the conditions. If 'a' is equal to '\n', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If 'a' is not equal to '/' and 'a' is not equal to '\n', count is updated to 1 and flag remains 0. If flag equals 1 after the execution, '/' has been written to the standard output.***
