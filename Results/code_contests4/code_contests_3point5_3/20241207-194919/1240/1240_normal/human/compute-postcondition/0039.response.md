Postcondition: ***The loop will continue indefinitely, 'a' is read from the standard input (stdin) one character at a time. If flag is 0, then flag will be set to 1. Otherwise, if flag is already 1, the loop will continue indefinitely with 'a' being read from the standard input one character at a time.***
