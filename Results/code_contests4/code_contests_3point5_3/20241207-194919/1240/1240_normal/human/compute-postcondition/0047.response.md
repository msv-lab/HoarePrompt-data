Postcondition: ***The loop will continue indefinitely, 'a' is read from the standard input (stdin) one character at a time. If 'a' is equal to '/', then the flag will be set to 1. If 'a' is equal to '\n', the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if flag is 0, it will be set to 1. If flag is already 1, the loop will continue indefinitely with 'a' being read from the standard input one character at a time. If 'a' is not equal to '\n', the flag will be set to 0 and the count will be reset to 0.***
