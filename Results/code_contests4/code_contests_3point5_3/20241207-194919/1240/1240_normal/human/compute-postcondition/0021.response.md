Postcondition: ***The input path is a string containing lowercase Latin letters and character '/', starting with at least one character '/'; count is either 0 or 1. If 'a' is '/', the input path remains '/', and flag is either 0 or 1 based on the initial value of flag. If 'a' is '\n', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If 'a' is not '/', and not '\n', count is updated to 1 and flag remains 0. If flag equals 1 after the execution, '/' has been written to the standard output.***
