Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input characters indefinitely. If the character is '/', the flag is set to 1. If the character is '\n', the loop breaks. If the character is neither '/' nor '\n', the count is updated, and the character is output. After the loop finishes, 'count' holds the total count of characters that were not '/' and were not part of the newline character. If count is 0, '/' is written to the standard output. 'flag' is set to 1 if '/' was encountered during the loop; otherwise, 'flag' remains 0.**
