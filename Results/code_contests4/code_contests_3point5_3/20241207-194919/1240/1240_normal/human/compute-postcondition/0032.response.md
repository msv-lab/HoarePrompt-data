Example Answer:
The value of `flag` is assigned 0, so there is no effect on the count variable. The value of `a` is output to the standard output. The state of the program variables after execution is: flag is 0, count is unchanged, and `a` is output.
Output State: **flag is 0, count is unchanged, `a` is output**
