Example Answer: 
The value of 'a' determines the flow of the program. If 'a' meets the condition to break out of the loop or if statement, then the program will break at this point. If 'a' does not meet the condition, the program will continue as is. Therefore, the Output State is dependent on the value of 'a'.
Output State: **Dependent on the value of 'a'**
