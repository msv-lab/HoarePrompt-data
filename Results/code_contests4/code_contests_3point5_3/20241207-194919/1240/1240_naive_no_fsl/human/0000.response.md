Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle the normalization of paths according to the problem description. The program reads characters from standard input and writes them to standard output while trying to handle multiple '/' characters. However, the program does not fully implement the logic required to normalize the path.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input: //usr/local////nginx/sbin
Expected Output: /usr/local/nginx/sbin
Actual Output (from the program): /usr/local//nginx/sbin

The program fails to remove all unnecessary '/' characters and does not produce the normalized path as specified in the problem description.
