Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `yc`. Since no operations are performed on the variables, the values of xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100. ya is less than yb. ya is equal to yb. If (ya == yc and xa + xb + xc == yc) is true, then xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are retained in their initial state.
Output State: **xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100. ya is less than yb. ya is equal to yb. If (ya == yc and xa + xb + xc == yc) is true, then xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are retained in their initial state.**
