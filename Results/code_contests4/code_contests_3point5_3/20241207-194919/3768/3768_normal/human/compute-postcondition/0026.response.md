Postcondition: ***xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100. ya is less than yb. If ya == yb, then the program retains the initial state of the variables xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc. Additionally, if (ya == yc and xa + xb + xc == yc) is false, the program retains the initial state of the variables xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc. If ya > yb, the program retains the initial state of the variables xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc. After entering the if condition (xa == xb), the program retains the initial state of the variables xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc.***
