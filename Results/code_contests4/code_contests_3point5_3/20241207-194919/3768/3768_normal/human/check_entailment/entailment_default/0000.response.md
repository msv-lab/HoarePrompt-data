Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the code and the problem description, it can be seen that the code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to place all three logos on a square billboard without overlapping and leaving empty space. The function `func_1` takes the dimensions of the logos of the three companies and checks various conditions to ensure that the logos can be placed on a square billboard. The code covers different cases based on the dimensions of the logos and correctly prints the output as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints provided align with the code's functionality and further validate that the code is correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
