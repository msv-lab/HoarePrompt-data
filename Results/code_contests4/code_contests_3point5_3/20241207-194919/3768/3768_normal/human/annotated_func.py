#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts positive integer parameters `xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc` such that 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100. The function returns True in Cases 1 to 5 based on specific conditions being met. However, the function returns False in Case 6. The function prints specific characters based on the conditions in each case but does not provide any output indication other than True or False.
