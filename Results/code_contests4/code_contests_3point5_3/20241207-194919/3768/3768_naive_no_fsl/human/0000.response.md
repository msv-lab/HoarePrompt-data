Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to place all three logos on a square billboard without overlapping or leaving any empty space. It checks all possible combinations of logo sizes and orientations to find a valid solution. The output format also follows the requirements specified in the problem description. Additionally, the program covers all possible cases by trying different combinations of logo sizes and orientations.
