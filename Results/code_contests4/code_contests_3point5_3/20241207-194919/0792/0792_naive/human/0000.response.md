Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It simply counts the occurrences of the third smallest element in the array, which is not the correct approach to find the number of triples (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible. The program should calculate the count of triples with the minimum product, not just the count of the third smallest element.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
1 2 2 3 4 5
```
The correct output should be 3 (triples (1, 2, 2), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4)), but the given program will output 2. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is false as it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.
