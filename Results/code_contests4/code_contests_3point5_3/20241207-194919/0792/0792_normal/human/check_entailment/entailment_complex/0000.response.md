Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described in the problem description. The program only counts the number of elements equal to the third smallest element in the array, rather than finding the minimum possible product of three elements and counting the number of triples that result in this minimum product.

The program should find the minimum possible product of three elements in the array and then count the number of triples of indices (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is equal to the minimum product.
