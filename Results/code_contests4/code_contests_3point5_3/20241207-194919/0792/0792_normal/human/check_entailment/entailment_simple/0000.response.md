Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of triples of indices (i, j, k) (i < j < k) such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible. It sorts the input array `a`, then takes the third element as the minimum value `x`. It then iterates through the array starting from the fourth element to count the number of elements equal to `x`. This count represents the number of triples that result in the minimum product. The program outputs this count, which is the correct answer to the problem description.
