You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After returning from the army Makes received a gift — an array a consisting of n positive integer numbers. He hadn't been solving problems for a long time, so he became interested to answer a particular question: how many triples of indices (i, j, k) (i < j < k), such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible, are there in the array? Help him with it!

Input

The first line of input contains a positive integer number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of elements in array a. The second line contains n positive integer numbers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of a given array.

Output

Print one number — the quantity of triples (i, j, k) such that i, j and k are pairwise distinct and ai·aj·ak is minimum possible.

Examples

Input

4
1 1 1 1


Output

4


Input

5
1 3 2 3 4


Output

2


Input

6
1 3 3 1 3 2


Output

1

Note

In the first example Makes always chooses three ones out of four, and the number of ways to choose them is 4.

In the second example a triple of numbers (1, 2, 3) is chosen (numbers, not indices). Since there are two ways to choose an element 3, then the answer is 2.

In the third example a triple of numbers (1, 1, 2) is chosen, and there's only one way to choose indices.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = sorted(a)
    x = a[2]
    ans = 1
    for i in xrange(3, len(a)):
        if a[i] == x:
            ans += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is the index of the last element in list `a`, and `ans` is the number of elements equal to `x` in the list `a` starting from the third element.
    print(ans)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
