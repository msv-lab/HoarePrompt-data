Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes an integer `n` as input representing the number of elements in the array, and a list of integers `a` representing the array elements.
- The code then sorts the array `a` in ascending order to easily find the minimum possible product of three elements.
- It then finds the third element `x` in the sorted array, as the product of the three minimum elements will involve this element.
- Finally, it iterates through the sorted array starting from the fourth element and counts the number of elements equal to `x`.
- The count represents the quantity of triples (i, j, k) such that i, j and k are pairwise distinct, and ai·aj·ak is the minimum possible.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases provided in the examples.
