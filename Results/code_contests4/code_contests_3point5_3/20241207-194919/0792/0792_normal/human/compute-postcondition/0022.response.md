Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, sorts the list, finds the third element `x` of the sorted list, and then counts the number of elements equal to `x` in the list starting from the fourth element. It does not return any value but prints the count of elements equal to `x`.**
