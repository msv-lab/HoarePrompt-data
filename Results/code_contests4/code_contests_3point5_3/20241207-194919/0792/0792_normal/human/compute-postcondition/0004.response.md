Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `x` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the raw input, `x` is the third element of list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the raw input, `x` is the third element of list `a`**
