Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 3. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `x`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
