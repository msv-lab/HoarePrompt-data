Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `ans` is increased by 1**
