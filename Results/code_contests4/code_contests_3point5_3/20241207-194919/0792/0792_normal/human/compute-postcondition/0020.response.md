Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is the number of elements equal to `x` in the list `a` starting from the third element. Since `x` is the third element of the sorted list `a`, the count of elements equal to `x` will be at least 1. Therefore, the value of `ans` is at least 1. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is the index of the last element in list `a`, and the number of elements equal to `x` in the list `a` starting from the third element is printed.**
