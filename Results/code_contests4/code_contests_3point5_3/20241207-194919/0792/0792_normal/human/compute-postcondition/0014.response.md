Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `ans` is increased by 1 if a[i] == x. Otherwise, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
