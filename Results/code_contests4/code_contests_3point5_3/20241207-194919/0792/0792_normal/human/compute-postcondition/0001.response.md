Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the input obtained by splitting the raw input. Since `n` is an input integer, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a mapped list of integers from the raw input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a mapped list of integers from the raw input**
