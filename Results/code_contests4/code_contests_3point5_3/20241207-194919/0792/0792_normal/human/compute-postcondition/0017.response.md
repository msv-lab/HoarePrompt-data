Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 5, for the loop to execute a third time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `ans` is increased by 1 if a[i] == x and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
