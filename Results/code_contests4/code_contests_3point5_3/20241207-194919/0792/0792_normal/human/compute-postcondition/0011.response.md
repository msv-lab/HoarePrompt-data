According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `i` should be less than the length of list `a`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`**
