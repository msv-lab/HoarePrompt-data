Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 5. If `a[5]` is equal to `x`, `ans` will be increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[5]` is not equal to `x` and the loop hasn't executed three times yet, `ans` remains unchanged and the loop continues.***
