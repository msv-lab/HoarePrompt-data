Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1 if the value of `a[i]` is equal to the value of `x`. The initial state provides that `i` is 5, so `a[5]` is compared with `x`. Since `x` is defined as the third element of list `a`, `a[5]` is compared with the third element of `a`. If they are equal, `ans` is increased by 1. The loop will execute a third time if `i` is less than the length of list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 5, `ans` will be increased by 1 if `a[5]` is equal to `x`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `i` is 5, `ans` will be increased by 1 if `a[5]` is equal to `x`**
