Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the number of triples of indices (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is the minimum possible. It sorts the input array, identifies the minimum value, and then counts the occurrences of that value in the array. The logic implemented in the program is correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The examples provided in the problem description also give the expected output when tested with the program. Hence, the program is correct.
