Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for n, k, and the array of integers.
2. It correctly calculates the number of subarrays that contain at least k equal numbers.
3. The logic used to keep track of the indices of the elements in the array is correct.
4. The program handles the case where k is equal to 1 separately, as the formula to calculate the count is different in that case.
5. The program calculates and prints the correct count of subarrays that satisfy the conditions given in the problem description.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
