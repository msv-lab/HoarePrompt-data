Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of subarrays that have at least k equal numbers. 

The issue lies in the calculation of the `count` variable. The calculation `count += leftmost + 1` inside the for loop is incorrect. This approach does not accurately count the number of subarrays with at least k equal numbers. 

The correct approach would involve properly updating the `count` variable when a subarray with at least k equal numbers is found. The current implementation does not achieve this accurately. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
