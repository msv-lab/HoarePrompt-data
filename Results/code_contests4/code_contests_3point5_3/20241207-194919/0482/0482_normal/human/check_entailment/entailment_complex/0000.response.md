Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of subarrays that have at least `k` equal numbers. The logic implemented in the program does not align with the problem description.

The key issue is that the program does not correctly update the count of subarrays as required by the problem description. The logic within the for loop where it updates the `count` based on the `leftmost` value is incorrect and does not capture the correct number of subarrays with at least `k` equal numbers.

Additionally, the if condition `(k == 1)` does not handle the case correctly as it calculates the `count` incorrectly. The calculation `count = n * (n + 1) / 2` is not suitable for this problem.

Overall, the program does not provide the correct solution for the problem described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
