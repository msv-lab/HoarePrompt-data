Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The output hints suggest that the code should calculate the number of subarrays in the input array that have at least `k` equal numbers. However, the code implementation seems to have issues with keeping track of the correct indices of the last `k` occurrences of each value in the array. This can lead to incorrect counts of subarrays with at least `k` equal numbers.

In addition, the code calculates the `count` variable based on the `leftmost` variable, which is not updated correctly in all cases. This can result in inaccuracies in counting the subarrays that meet the specified criteria.

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the provided problem description and the output hints do not fully agree with the code implementation.
