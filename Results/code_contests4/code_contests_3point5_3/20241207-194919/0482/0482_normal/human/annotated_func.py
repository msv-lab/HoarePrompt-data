    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5. If `k` == 1, `count` is calculated as described. If `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is the total sum of all `leftmost` values + 1 after each iteration, `d` contains keys `val` and values `[i]` where `i` is the index of `val` in `vals`, `leftmost` is the maximum index value from the last `k` occurrences of each `val` in `vals`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values `n`, `k`, and an array `vals` from the standard input. It then calculates a `count` based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `vals`. If `k` is equal to 1, `count` is calculated differently compared to when `k` is not equal to 1. In the latter case, the function iterates through `vals`, keeping track of the maximum index of the last `k` occurrences of each value in `vals` in the `leftmost` variable. The final `count` is the total sum of all these `leftmost` values plus 1 after each iteration. The functionality of the function is not fully clear based on the provided information, and additional details or edge cases are needed to understand its complete purpose.
