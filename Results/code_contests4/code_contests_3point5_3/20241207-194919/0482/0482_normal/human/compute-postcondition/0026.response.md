Example Answer:
The code `d[val] += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list stored in the dictionary `d` at key `val`. The initial values of variables are retained, so after execution, the dictionary `d` might have been updated to include the new key `val` with the value `[i]` appended to the existing list. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `vals`, `i`, and `val` retain their initial values, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than the length of `vals`**
