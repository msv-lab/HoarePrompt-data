Example Answer:
The value of `count` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `n+1` and then dividing by 2. Since the initial value of `k` is 1 and it is not used in the calculation, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5 and `count` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5 and `count` is calculated as described**
