According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `vals` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list `vals` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0 and `val` is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is 0, `d` is an empty dictionary, `leftmost` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `vals` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0 and `val` is the first element in the list**
