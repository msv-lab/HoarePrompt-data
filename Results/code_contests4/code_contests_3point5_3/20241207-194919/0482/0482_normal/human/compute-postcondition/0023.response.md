Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is 0, `d` is a dictionary. If `val` is in dictionary `d` and the length of the list associated with `val` is less than `k`, the program remains in the same state. If `val` is not in dictionary `d`, `n`, `k`, `count`, and `leftmost` retain their initial values, `d` has key `val` and value `[i]`, for the loop to execute the first time `vals` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `val` is the first element in the list.***
