Postcondition: ***`count`, `i` are integers, `d` is a dictionary, `val` is a key in `d`, `leftmost`, `dval` are values from `d`. If `val` is in `d`, the program updates `d` with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, increments `i` by 1, assigns `dval` the value of `d[val]`, sets `leftmost` to `d[val][k]`, checks if `len(dval) < k`, increments `count` by `leftmost` + 1. If `len(dval) >= k` and `d[val][k]` > `leftmost`, increments `count` by `leftmost` + 1 and updates `leftmost` to the k-th element from the end of the list `d[val]`. If `val` is not in `d`, increments `count` by `leftmost` + 1, updates `d` with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, increments `i` by 1, assigns `dval` the value of `d[val]`, sets `leftmost` to `dval`.***
