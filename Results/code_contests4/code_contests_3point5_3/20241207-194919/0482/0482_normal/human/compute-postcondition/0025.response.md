According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `vals`. If `i` is less than the length of `vals`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `vals`, `i`, and `val` retain their initial values. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than the length of `vals`.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `vals`, `i`, and `val` retain their initial values, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than the length of `vals`**
