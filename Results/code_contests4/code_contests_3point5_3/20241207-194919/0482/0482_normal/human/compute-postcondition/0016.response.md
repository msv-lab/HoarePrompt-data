Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `leftmost` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `vals` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `val` is the first element in the list, `val` is a key in dictionary `d`, dictionary `d` has key `val` with a list containing 0, `dval` is a list containing 0. The length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dvalk` is assigned the value of the element at index `-k` in the list `dval`.**
