Example Answer:
The code snippet reads `n` integer values from the input and stores them in a list `vals`. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5**
