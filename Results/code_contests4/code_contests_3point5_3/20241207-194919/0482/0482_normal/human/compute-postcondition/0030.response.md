Example Answer:
`leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`, where `dvalk` represents the last `k` elements of the value stored in `d[val]`. The previous values of `dvalk` and `d[val]` are unknown, so the output state is: `dvalk` is the last `k` elements of the value stored in `d[val]`, `leftmost` is assigned the same value.
Output State: **`dvalk` is the last `k` elements of the value stored in `d[val]`, `leftmost` is assigned the same value**
