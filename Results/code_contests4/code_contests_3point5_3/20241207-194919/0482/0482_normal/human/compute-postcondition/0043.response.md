Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `leftmost` is assigned the same value as `d[val][k]`, `i` is less than the length of `vals`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. If `len(dval) < k`, the program increments `count` by `leftmost` + 1. If `len(dval) >= k` and `d[val][k]` is greater than `leftmost`, the program increments `count` by `leftmost` + 1 and updates `leftmost` to the k-th element from the end of the list `d[val]`. Otherwise, no further operations are executed.***
