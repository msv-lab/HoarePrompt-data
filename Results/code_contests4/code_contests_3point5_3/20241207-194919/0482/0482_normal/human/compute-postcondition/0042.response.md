Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `leftmost` is assigned the same value as the k-th element from the end of the list `d[val]`, `i` is less than the length of `vals`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. If `d[val][k]` is greater than `leftmost`, the program continues with the mentioned operations. Otherwise, the program does not execute any further operations.***
