Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is 0, `d` is an empty dictionary, `leftmost` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `vals` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0 and `val` is the first element in the list. The value `val` is not in the dictionary `d`.***
