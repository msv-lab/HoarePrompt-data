Example Answer:
The code snippet `dvalk = dval[-k]` assigns the value of the k-th element from the end of the list `dval` to the variable `dvalk`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `leftmost` is assigned the same value as `dvalk`, `i` is less than the length of `vals`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `leftmost` is assigned the same value as the k-th element from the end of the list `d[val]`, `i` is less than the length of `vals`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`.
Output State: **`count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `leftmost` is assigned the same value as the k-th element from the end of the list `d[val]`, `i` is less than the length of `vals`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`**
