Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()[:2])`. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers, and the array `a` containing positive integers is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5**
