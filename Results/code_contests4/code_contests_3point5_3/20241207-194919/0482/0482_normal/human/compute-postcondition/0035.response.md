Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is increased by `leftmost` + 1, `d` may have been updated with a new key `val` and value `[i]`, `vals`, `i`, and `val` retain their initial values, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than the length of `vals`. If `val` is in `d`, then `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, then `dvalk` is the last `k` elements of the value stored in `d[val]`. Otherwise, `leftmost` is assigned the same value as `dvalk`.**
