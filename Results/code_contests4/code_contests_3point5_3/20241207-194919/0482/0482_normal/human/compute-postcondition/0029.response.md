Example Answer:
`dvalk` is assigned the value of the last `k` elements of `dval`. Since `k` is a positive integer, and `dval` was assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` will contain the last `k` elements of the value stored in `d[val]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dvalk` is the last `k` elements of the value stored in `d[val]`.
Output State: **`dvalk` is the last `k` elements of the value stored in `d[val]`**
