Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 4·10^5, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk` where `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost` for the first execution of the loop. All other variables remain the same.***
