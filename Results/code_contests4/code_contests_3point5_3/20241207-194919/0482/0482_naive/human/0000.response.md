Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. It does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem statement. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2
1 1 1
```
The correct output should be 6, as there are 6 subarrays with at least 2 equal numbers: (1), (1), (1), (1,1), (1,1), and (1,1,1). However, the program does not produce the correct output for this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
