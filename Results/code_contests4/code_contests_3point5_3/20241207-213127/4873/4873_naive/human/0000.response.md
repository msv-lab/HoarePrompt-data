Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly reads the input values for N, A, B, and C. It then iterates over each character position in the strings A, B, and C, counts the unique characters at that position by using a dictionary, and adds the count of unique characters minus 1 to the total number of operations needed. This logic correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal. The program covers all possible cases and works as expected.
