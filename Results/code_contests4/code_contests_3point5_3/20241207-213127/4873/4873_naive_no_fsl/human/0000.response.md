Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal. It iterates over each character position in the strings and keeps track of unique characters seen so far. The code then subtracts 1 from the total number of unique characters seen at each position and sums up these differences to get the minimum number of operations required. The code handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
