Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings A, B, and C equal. It does this by iterating through each character position in the strings and keeping track of unique characters in a dictionary. Then, it calculates the total unique characters in all three strings and subtracts 3 (since there are 3 strings) to get the minimum number of operations required.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately implements the operation of changing a character in a chosen string to achieve the objective of making all three strings equal.
