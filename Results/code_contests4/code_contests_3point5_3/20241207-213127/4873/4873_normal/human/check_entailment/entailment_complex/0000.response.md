Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer N followed by three strings A, B, and C of length N each. It then calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal by counting the total number of unique characters across all three strings and subtracting 3 times the number of strings. This value is printed as the output.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately calculates the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective of making all three strings equal.
