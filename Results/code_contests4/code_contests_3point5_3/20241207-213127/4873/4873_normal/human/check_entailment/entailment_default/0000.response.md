Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal by changing one character at a time. However, the code only calculates the total number of unique characters across all three strings and subtracts 3 times the number of strings. This approach does not accurately determine the minimum number of operations required. Additionally, the code does not handle the actual changing of characters in the strings to make them equal. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
