The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it works with the variables N, A, B, and C, which are defined within the function. N is a positive integer, while A, B, and C are strings of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. The function does not have a specific return value mentioned in the provided constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` involves processing the strings A, B, and C based on the given constraints and possibly performing some operations or transformations on them without explicitly returning a value.
