Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespaces. The value of `N` is a positive integer, so after execution, `n` will hold a positive integer value. The variables A, B, and C remain unchanged.
Output State: **N is a positive integer. A, B, and C are strings of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. `n` is a positive integer**
