The function `func` reads an integer `N` as input, then reads a list of integers and calculates a value `ans` based on certain conditions involving `x` and `y`. It iterates over the list and counts the number of elements that are less than the current element both before and after the current index. It then adds the minimum count between `x` and `y` to the total `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and solely operates on the input provided during its execution.
