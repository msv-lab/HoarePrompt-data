According to the code, the loop will execute N times as j iterates from 0 to N-1. Before the loop starts, the conditions for the loop to execute are: N is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `x` and `y`, `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, and `i` is N-1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `x` and `y`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is N-1**
