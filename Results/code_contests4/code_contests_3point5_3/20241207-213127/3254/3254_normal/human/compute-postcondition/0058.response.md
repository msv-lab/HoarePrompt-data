Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers. Depending on whether j < i or not, the value of x and y will be updated accordingly. If a[j] < a[i] and j < i, x is increased by 1 and ans is updated by the minimum of x and y. If a[j] < a[i] and j >= i, y is increased by 1 and ans is updated by the minimum of x and y. The loop will execute one more time by incrementing j by 1 after the if else block.***
