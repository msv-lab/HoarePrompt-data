Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `x` and `y`, `x` contains the total number of times a[j] is less than a[i] for all i and j, `y` contains the total number of times a[j] is less than a[i] for all i and j, `i` is N, `x` is the total count of a[j] being less than a[i] for all i and j where j < i, `y` is the total count of a[j] being less than a[i] for all i and j where j >= i.**
