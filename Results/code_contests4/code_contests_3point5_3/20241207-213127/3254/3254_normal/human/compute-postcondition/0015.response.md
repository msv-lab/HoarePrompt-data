Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers, ans is 0, x and y are set based on conditions mentioned. If a[j] < a[i] and j < i, x is incremented by 1, y is set based on conditions, and j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If a[j] < a[i] and j >= i, y is increased by 1.***
