Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers. Depending on the relationship between a[j] and a[i] and the values of j and i, x and y will be updated accordingly. If a[j] < a[i] and j < i, x is increased by 1, y is 0, and ans is updated by the minimum of x and y. If a[j] < a[i] and j >= i, x is 0, y is increased by 1, and ans is updated by the minimum of x and y. The loop will execute one more time by incrementing j by 1 after the if else block.***
