Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `x` and `y`, `x` contains the number of times `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` and `j < i`, `y` contains the number of times `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` and `j >= i`, `i` is `N+2`, `x` and `y` are adjusted based on the loop body, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `N+1`, `y` is increased by 1.**
