Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers, ans is 0. If j < i, x is set to 1, y remains at 0, j is less than i. Additionally, a[j] is less than a[i]. If j is greater than or equal to i, x remains at 0, y is set to 1, j is greater than or equal to i.***
