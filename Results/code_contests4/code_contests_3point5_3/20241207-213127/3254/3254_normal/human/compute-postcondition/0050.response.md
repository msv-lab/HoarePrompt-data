Output State: **N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers, ans is increased by the minimum value between x and y, x is 1, y is 0, i is N-1. In the program, when the condition (a[j] < a[i]) is true, the value at index j in list a is less than the value at index i. Additionally, after entering the if condition (j < i), the index j is less than the index i in the list a**
