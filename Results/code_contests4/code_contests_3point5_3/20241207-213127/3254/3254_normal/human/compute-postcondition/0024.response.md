Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `x` and `y`, `x` contains the number of times a[j] is less than a[i] and j < i, `y` contains the number of times a[j] is less than a[i] and j >= i, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be incremented by 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
