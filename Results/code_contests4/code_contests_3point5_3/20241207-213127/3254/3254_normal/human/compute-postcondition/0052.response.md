Example Answer:
`y` is increased by 1. The previous value of `y` is 0, so after execution, `y` becomes 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers, ans is increased by the minimum value between x and y, x is 0, y is 1, i is N-1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers, ans is increased by the minimum value between x and y, x is 0, y is 1, i is N-1**
