According to the code, the loop will execute N times. Before the loop starts, `N` is the input value ensures the loop will execute. `a` contains absolute values of integers from raw input means that `a` is a list of absolute values obtained from some input. For the loop to execute the first time, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` must be a list containing absolute values of integers, and `ans` is 0.
State: **`N` is the input value, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0**
