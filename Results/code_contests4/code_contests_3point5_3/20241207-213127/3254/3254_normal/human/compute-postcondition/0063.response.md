Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers. If j < i, x is increased by 1, y is updated based on the conditions, and j is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If j >= i, x and y are updated based on the conditions, and j is still incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, with y being additionally increased by 1.***
