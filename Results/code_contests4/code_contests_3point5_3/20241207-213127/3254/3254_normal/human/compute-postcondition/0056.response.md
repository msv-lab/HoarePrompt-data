Output State: **N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers, ans is increased by the minimum value between x and y. If a[j] < a[i] and j < i, x is 1, y is 0, and the index j is less than the index i in list a. If a[j] < a[i] and j >= i, x is 0, y is 1, for the loop to execute one more time j should be incremented by 1, x is increased by 1.**
