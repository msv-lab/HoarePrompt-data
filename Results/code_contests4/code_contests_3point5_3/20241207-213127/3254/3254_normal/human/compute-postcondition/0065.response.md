Output State: **N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers. After the loop finishes executing, x will contain the number of times a[j] is less than a[i] where j < i, and y will contain the number of times a[j] is less than a[i] where j >= i. The value of ans will be increased by the minimum of x and y.**
