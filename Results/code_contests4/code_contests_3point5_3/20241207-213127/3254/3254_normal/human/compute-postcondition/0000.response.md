Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of the input, `a` is assigned the absolute values of the integers obtained from splitting the raw input, and `ans` is assigned 0. The variables `N`, `a`, and `ans` are affected by the code. 
Output State: **`N` is the input value, `a` contains absolute values of integers from raw input, `ans` is 0**
