Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers, `ans` is the total sum of the minimum value between `x` and `y` for all iterations, where `x` contains the total count of times a[j] is less than a[i] for all i and j where j < i, and `y` contains the total count of times a[j] is less than a[i] for all i and j where j >= i. The total sum of the minimum value between `x` and `y` for all iterations is printed.**
