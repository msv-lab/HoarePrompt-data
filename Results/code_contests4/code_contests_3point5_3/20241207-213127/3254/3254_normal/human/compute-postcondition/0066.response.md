Example Answer:
Initially, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers. After the loop finishes executing, `x` will contain the number of times `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` where `j < i`, and `y` will contain the number of times `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` where `j >= i`. The value of `ans` will be increased by the minimum of `x` and `y`.

After executing `ans += min(x, y)`, the value of `ans` will be increased by the minimum of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers. `ans` is increased by the minimum of `x` and `y`.**
