Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, a is a list containing absolute values of integers, ans is 0. If j < i and a[j] < a[i], x is increased by 1, y is set based on conditions, and j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute. If j >= i and a[j] < a[i], x and y are set based on conditions mentioned, j is increased by 1, and the loop conditions related to comparisons between elements of list a are checked again.***
