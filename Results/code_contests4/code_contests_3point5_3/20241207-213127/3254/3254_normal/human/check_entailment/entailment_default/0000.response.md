Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is not correctly calculating the minimum number of inversions that Jeff can get by multiplying some numbers of the sequence by -1. The code is counting the number of elements that are less than the current element both before and after the current index, but it is not handling the case where multiplying a number by -1 can reduce the number of inversions.

For example, if the input is:
```
5
-1 2 -3 4 -5
```
The correct output should be 6, as Jeff can multiply the second and fourth elements by -1 to get the sequence [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5] which has 6 inversions. However, the code will output 7 as it is not considering the possibility of multiplying numbers by -1 to reduce inversions. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect and the correctness is **False**.
