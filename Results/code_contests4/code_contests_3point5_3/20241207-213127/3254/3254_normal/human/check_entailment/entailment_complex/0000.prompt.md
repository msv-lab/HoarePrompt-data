You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p1, p2, ..., pn for his birthday.

Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a1, a2, ..., an is a pair of indexes i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that an inequality ai > aj holds.

Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p1, p2, ..., pn (|pi| ≤ 105). The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    N, a, ans = input(), map(lambda x: abs(int(x)), raw_input().split()), 0
    for i in xrange(0, N):
        x, y = 0, 0
        
        for j in xrange(0, N):
            if a[j] < a[i]:
                if j < i:
                    x += 1
                else:
                    y += 1
        
        ans += min(x, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing absolute values of integers, `ans` is the total sum of the minimum value between `x` and `y` for all iterations, where `x` contains the total count of times a[j] is less than a[i] for all i and j where j < i, and `y` contains the total count of times a[j] is less than a[i] for all i and j where j >= i
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `N` as input, then reads a list of integers and calculates a value `ans` based on certain conditions involving `x` and `y`. It iterates over the list and counts the number of elements that are less than the current element both before and after the current index. It then adds the minimum count between `x` and `y` to the total `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and solely operates on the input provided during its execution.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
