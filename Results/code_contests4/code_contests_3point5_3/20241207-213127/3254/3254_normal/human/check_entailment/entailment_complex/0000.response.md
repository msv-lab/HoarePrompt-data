Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of inversions that Jeff can get in the given sequence by counting the number of elements that are less than the current element both before and after the current index. It then adds the minimum count between `x` and `y` to the total `ans`, which is the minimum number of inversions. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all cases.
