Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It calculates the number of inversions incorrectly. The program calculates the number of inversions by counting the number of elements to the left and right of the current element that are smaller than the current element. However, this does not account for the fact that Jeff can multiply some numbers by -1.

To correct the program, we need to take into account the fact that Jeff can multiply some numbers by -1. This means that the absolute value of an element in the sequence can be negated. By negating an element, we can change the relative ordering of elements and potentially reduce the number of inversions.

Therefore, the program needs to consider all possible combinations of negating elements and then calculate the minimum number of inversions that can be achieved.
