Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get by iterating over the sequence and counting the number of elements that are less than the current element on both sides. It then adds the minimum of those two counts to the total number of inversions. The logic seems correct for all potential cases as it follows the problem description accurately.
