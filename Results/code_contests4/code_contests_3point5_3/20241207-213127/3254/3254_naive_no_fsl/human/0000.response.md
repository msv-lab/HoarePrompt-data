Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of inversions as described in the problem statement. The logic used in the program does not accurately calculate the number of inversions that Jeff can obtain by multiplying some numbers by -1. The program is counting the number of inversions in the original sequence, but it should consider the possible inversions after multiplying some elements by -1.

Example where the program fails:
Input:
3
-2 -1 1

Output:
2

Explanation:
The program will output 1 as the minimum number of inversions, but the correct answer is 2. By multiplying the first element (-2) by -1, we get the sequence -2 -1 1, which has 2 inversions (1, -1) and (1, -2).
