Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but since it is increased by 2 initially, the new value of `j` is now increased by 3. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is increased by 3, `k` is increased by 2, `col` is assigned a new input string, for the loop to execute `m` must be greater than the new value of `j`.
Output State: **All elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is increased by 3, `k` is increased by 2, `col` is assigned a new input string, for the loop to execute `m` must be greater than the new value of `j`**
