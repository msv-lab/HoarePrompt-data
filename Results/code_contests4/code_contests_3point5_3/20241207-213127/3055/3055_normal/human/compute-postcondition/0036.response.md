According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, all elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is equal to `m+1`, and `k` is increased by 1. To execute the loop again, `k` needs to be less than `n+1` (since `k` was increased by 1 at the end of the last iteration). 
State: **All elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is equal to `m+1`, `k` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be less than `n+1`**
