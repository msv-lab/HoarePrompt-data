Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds` (updated with the new elements), `col`, `i`, `j+1` remain as described. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, then the loop executes one more time with `j` incremented by 1. If `i + 1 < n`, the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is added to `frnds`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
