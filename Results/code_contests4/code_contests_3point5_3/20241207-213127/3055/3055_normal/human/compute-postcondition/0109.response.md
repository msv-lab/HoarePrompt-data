Example Answer: 
The element `mtrx[i][j + 1]` is added to the set `frnds`. The previous values of variables are maintained except for `frnds`, which now includes the new element. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j+1` remain as described. If j - 1 > 0, the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is added to `frnds`, and now `frnds` contains the additional element from `mtrx[i][j + 1]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds` (updated with the new element if j - 1 > 0), `col`, `i`, `j+1` remain as described. If j - 1 > 0, the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is added to `frnds`. Otherwise, no changes occur.**
