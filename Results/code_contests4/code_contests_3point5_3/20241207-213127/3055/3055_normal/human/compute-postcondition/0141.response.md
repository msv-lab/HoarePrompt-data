According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.' and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, and `i+1` is less than `n`. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than `m`.
State: **`frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.' and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `i+1` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`**
