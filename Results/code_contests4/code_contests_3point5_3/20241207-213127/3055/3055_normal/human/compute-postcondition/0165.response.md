Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `frnds` will contain all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', if '.' is in `frnds`, then it indicates that at least one of the surrounding cells in `mtrx` contains a value equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j`) will remain unchanged as described.***
