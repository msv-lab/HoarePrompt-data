Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j` remain as described. `i` and `j` are incremented by 1. `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and `mtrx[i][j]` is not equal to '.'. `i - 1` is greater than 0, so `frnds` now contains the value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]` added to the existing elements. `j - 1` is greater than 0, so `frnds` now also contains the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]`. The if condition `j + 1 < m` is true, so `frnds` has now added `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. Additionally, `i + 1 < n`, so `frnds` adds `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.**
