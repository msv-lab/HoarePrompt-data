According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already executed for all iterations, so the next iteration would require `i` to be greater than or equal to `n`.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `frnds` will contain all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j` remain as described. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `n`.**
