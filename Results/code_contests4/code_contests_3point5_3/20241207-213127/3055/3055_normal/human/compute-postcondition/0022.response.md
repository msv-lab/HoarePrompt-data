According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, President's desk colour `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is False or 2, `k` is 2, `mtrx` is a 2D list with `n` empty lists inside, `frnds` is an empty set, `col` is assigned the value of the user's raw input, `j` is equal to `m`, for the loop to execute the last time `j` is equal to `m`, `mtrx[0]` is extended with all elements of `col`, loop control variable `j` is equal to `m` after the loop is finished**.
