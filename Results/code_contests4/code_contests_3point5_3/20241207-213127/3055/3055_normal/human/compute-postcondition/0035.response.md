Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is equal to `m+1`, `k` is increased by 1.
Output State: **All elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is equal to `m+1`, `k` is increased by 1**
