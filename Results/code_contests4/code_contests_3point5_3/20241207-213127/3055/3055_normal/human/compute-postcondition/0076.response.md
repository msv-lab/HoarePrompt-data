Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j` remain as described. If `j + 1 < m`, `j` is increased by 1. After the execution of the if block, `frnds` includes the elements `mtrx[i][j + 1]` and `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, all the specified conditions are met.***
