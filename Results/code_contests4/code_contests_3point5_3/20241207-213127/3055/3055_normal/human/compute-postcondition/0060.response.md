Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` are as described in the precondition. If `i - 1` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains the added element `mtrx[i][j - 1]` and `j - 1` is greater than 0. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables. Additionally, `j + 1 < m`***
