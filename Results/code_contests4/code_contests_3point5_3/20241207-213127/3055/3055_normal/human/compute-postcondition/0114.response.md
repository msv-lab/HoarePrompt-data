According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `mtrx`, `c`, `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, the loop can execute again with `j` incremented by 1. If `i + 1 < n`, the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]` needs to be added to `frnds`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds` (updated with the new elements), `col`, `i`, `j+1`, if `mtrx[i][j+1] == c` and `mtrx[i][j+1] != '.'`, then the loop executes one more time with `j` incremented by 1. If `i + 1 < n`, the element `mtrx[i - 1][j+1]` is added to `frnds`.**
