Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds` (updated with the new elements), `col`, `i`, `j+1` are a set of variables and arrays. If `j - 1 > 0`, then the loop executes with the updated values. If the condition `mtrx[i][j+1] == c` and `mtrx[i][j+1] != '.'` is met, the loop continues with `j` incremented by 1. If `i + 1 < n`, then the element `mtrx[i - 1][j+1]` is added to `frnds`.***
