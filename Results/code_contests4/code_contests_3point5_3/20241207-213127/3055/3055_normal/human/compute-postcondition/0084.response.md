Example Answer:
The code adds the value of `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. If `j + 1 < m`, `j` is increased by 1. After this execution, `frnds` now includes the elements `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `mtrx[i + 1][j]`, `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, and `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, in addition to the newly added `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. If the conditions `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'` are met, the loop would need to execute one more time by increasing `j` by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `frnds` remain as described. If `j + 1 < m`, `j` is increased by 1. After executing the if block, `frnds` now includes the elements `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `mtrx[i + 1][j]`, `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, and the newly added `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, all specified conditions are met, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.**
