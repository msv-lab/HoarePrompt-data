Example Answer: 
The code snippet adds the element at position (i-1, j) of the matrix mtrx to the set frnds. The values of i, j, and m are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact element being added. The set frnds will now contain this new element. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, c, ii, iii, k, mtrx, col remain as described, j is either increased by 1 or remains the same, frnds contains the new element added from mtrx[i - 1][j].
Output State: **n, m, c, ii, iii, k, mtrx, col remain as described, j is either increased by 1 or remains the same, frnds contains the new element added from mtrx[i - 1][j]**
