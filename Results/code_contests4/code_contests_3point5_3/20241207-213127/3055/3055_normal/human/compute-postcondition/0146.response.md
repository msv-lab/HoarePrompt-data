Example Answer: 
The code adds the value of `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. The conditions for the loop to execute one more time are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: *`frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `i+1` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`, and `mtrx[i - 1][j]` has been added to `frnds` if `i - 1 > 0, if j - 1 > 0 is true.
Output State: **`frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.'**
