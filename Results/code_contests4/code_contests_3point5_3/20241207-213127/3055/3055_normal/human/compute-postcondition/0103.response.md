Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` remain as described. The loop has executed another time with `i` and `j` incremented by 1. `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. `i - 1` and `j - 1` are greater than 0, leading to `frnds` containing the values of `mtrx[i - 1][j]` and `mtrx[i][j - 1]` added to the existing elements. If `j + 1 < m`, `frnds` has also added `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. Moreover, `i + 1 < n`, resulting in `frnds` adding `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.***
