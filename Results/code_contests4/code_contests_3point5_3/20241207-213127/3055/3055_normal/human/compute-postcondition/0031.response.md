According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m+1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m+1`, which means `j` needs to be less than `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, President's desk colour `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is False or 2, `k` is 2, `mtrx` is a 2D list with `n` empty lists inside, `frnds` is an empty set, `col` is assigned the value of the user's raw input, `j` is less than `m`, `mtrx[0]` is extended with all elements of `col`, `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` is executed**.
