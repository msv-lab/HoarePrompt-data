Postcondition: ***`frnds` will contain all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. The value of `i` is greater than 1***
