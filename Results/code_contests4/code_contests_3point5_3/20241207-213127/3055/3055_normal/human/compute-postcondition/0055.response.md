Example Answer:
The code snippet adds the element at index `j` of the `i-1`th list in `mtrx` to the set `frnds`. Since `i` is greater than 1, this operation is valid. The set `frnds` now contains the added element. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is either `False` or 2, `k` is equal to `n`, `mtrx` is a 2D list with `n` lists containing elements of input strings, `frnds` contains the added element, `col` is assigned the last input string, `j` is equal to `m` for the last iteration. The element at the `j`th index of the `i`th list in `mtrx` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is either `False` or 2, `k` is equal to `n`, `mtrx` is a 2D list with `n` lists containing elements of input strings, `frnds` contains the added element, `col` is assigned the last input string, `j` is equal to `m` for the last iteration. The element at the `j`th index of the `i`th list in `mtrx` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'**
