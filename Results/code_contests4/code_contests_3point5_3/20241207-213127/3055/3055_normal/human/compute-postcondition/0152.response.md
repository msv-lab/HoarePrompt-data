Example Answer:
The element at position `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is added to the set `frnds`. The previous state of `frnds` is unknown, so the output state is: `frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `i+1` is less than `n`, `j` is increased by 1, `j` must be less than `m`, and `mtrx[i - 1][j]` has been added to `frnds` if `i - 1 > 0`, `j - 1 > 0` is true, and the element at position `mtrx[i + 1][j]` has been added to `frnds` as well. 
Output State: **`frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `i+1` is less than `n`, `j` is increased by 1, `j` must be less than `m`, and `mtrx[i - 1][j]` has been added to `frnds` if `i - 1 > 0`, `j - 1 > 0` is true, and the element at position `mtrx[i + 1][j]` has been added to `frnds` as well**
