According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is 0 and `m` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `m` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, President's desk colour `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is False or 2, `k` is 0, `mtrx` is a 2D list with `n` empty lists inside, `frnds` is an empty set, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the value of the user's raw input, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
