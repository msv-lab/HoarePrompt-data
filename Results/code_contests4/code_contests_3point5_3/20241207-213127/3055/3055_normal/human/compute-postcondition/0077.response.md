According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j + 1 < m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col` remain the same, `j` is increased by 1, and `frnds` includes the elements `mtrx[i][j + 1]` and `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, the conditions are met. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j` remain as described. If `j + 1 < m`, `j` is increased by 1. After the execution of the if block, `frnds` includes the elements `mtrx[i][j + 1]` and `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, all the specified conditions are met, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be increased by 1**.
