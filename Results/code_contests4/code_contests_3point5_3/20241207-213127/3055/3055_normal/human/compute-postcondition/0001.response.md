Example Answer:
`ii` is assigned the value of either `False` or `1`, where `False` is a boolean value and `1` is an integer. The previous value of `ii` is `False` or `0`, so after execution, `ii` becomes either `False` or `1`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, President's desk colour `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, The office-room description is a matrix of size `n x m` where each cell contains either an uppercase Latin letter representing a desk colour or a period character '.', `ii` is either `False` or `1`.
