Example Answer:
The value of `mtrx[i + 1][j]` is added to the set `frnds`. The loop may execute one more time based on the conditions specified. Additionally, `i+1` is less than `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', the newly added value, and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `i+1` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', the newly added value, and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `i+1` is less than `n`**
