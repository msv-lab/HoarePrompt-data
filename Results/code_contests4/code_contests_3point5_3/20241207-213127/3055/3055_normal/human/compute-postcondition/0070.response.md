Example Answer:
`frnds` now includes the new element `mtrx[i][j - 1]` which is added to the set. The previous states of the variables `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col` are not affected. Based on the description that `j` is either increased by 1 or remains the same if `i - 1 > 0`, we need to consider the possible values of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j` remain as described, `frnds` includes the new element `mtrx[i][j - 1]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j` remain as described, `frnds` includes the new element `mtrx[i][j - 1]`**
