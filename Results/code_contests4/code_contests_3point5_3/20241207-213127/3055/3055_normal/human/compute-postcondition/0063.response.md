Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` remain as described. If `j + 1 < m`, `frnds` contains the added element `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `col`, `j` are updated accordingly. If `(i + 1 < n)`, the program state is as follows: `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` remain as described. Additionally, `i + 1 < n`***
