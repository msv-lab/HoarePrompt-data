Example Answer:
The `extend` method is used to add elements from `col` at index `j` to the list at index `k` in `mtrx`. Since `j` is increased by 1 and `k` is increased by 2, the elements from `col` will be added to a different sublist of `mtrx` each time. The `col` variable is assigned a new input string, so the elements being extended will change. As long as `m` remains greater than 0, the loop will continue executing. 
Output State: **All elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 2, `col` is assigned a new input string, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0**
