Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is 0, `k` is increased by 1, `col` is assigned the input string.
Output State: **All elements of `col` are extended to `mtrx[k]`, `j` is 0, `k` is increased by 1, `col` is assigned the input string**
