Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j` remain as described. For the loop to execute another time, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is now incremented by 1. `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and `mtrx[i][j]` is not equal to '.'. Additionally, `i - 1` is greater than 0. `frnds` now contains the value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]` added to the existing elements.**
