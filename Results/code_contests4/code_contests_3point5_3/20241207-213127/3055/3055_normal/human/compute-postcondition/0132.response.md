Example Answer:
The value `mtrx[i][j - 1]` is added to the set `frnds`. The value of `j` is a positive integer greater than 1, so `j - 1` is also a positive integer. The condition `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.' is satisfied. Therefore, the newly added value to `frnds` is `mtrx[i][j - 1]`. The loop will execute one more time if `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since there are no changes in these conditions, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', and the newly added value**.
