The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates on the given constraints and relationships: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and President's desk colour c is an uppercase Latin letter. The office-room description is a matrix of size n x m where each cell contains either an uppercase Latin letter representing a desk colour or a period character '.' representing an empty cell.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to work with the given constraints and relationships related to the office-room description matrix and the President's desk colour.
