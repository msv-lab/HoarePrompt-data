According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute the first time, `m` should be greater than 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m` and `m` should be greater than 2.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, President's desk colour `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is False or 2, `k` is 0, `mtrx` is a 2D list with `n` empty lists inside, `frnds` is an empty set, `col` is assigned the value of the user's raw input, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 1, `mtrx[0]` is extended with the element `col[1]`, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than m and `m` is greater than 2**
