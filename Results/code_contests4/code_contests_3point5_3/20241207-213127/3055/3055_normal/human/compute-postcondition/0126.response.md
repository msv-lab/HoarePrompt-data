According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m` and `i`. If `m` is at least 1 and `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `frnds` will contain all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', so for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is greater than or equal to `n`.
