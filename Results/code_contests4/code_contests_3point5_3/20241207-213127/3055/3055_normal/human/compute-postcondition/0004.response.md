Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces from the list `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `c` are then converted to integers. The variables `ii` and `iii` are used as indices to access values from the list `k`. The output state after execution is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, President's desk colour `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is False or 2, `k` is a list containing the input split by spaces.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, President's desk colour `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is False or 2, `k` is a list containing the input split by spaces**
