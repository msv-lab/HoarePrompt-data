According to the code, the loop iteration depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, and `m`. In this case, for the loop to execute another time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` remain as described, and `i` and `j` have been incremented by 1. Additionally, `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', `i - 1` and `j - 1` are greater than 0, `frnds` contains the values of `mtrx[i - 1][j]` and `mtrx[i][j - 1]` added to the existing elements, `frnds` has also added `mtrx[i][j + 1]` if `j + 1 < m`, and `frnds` has included `mtrx[i + 1][j]` if `i + 1 < n`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `i`, `j` remain as described. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and the conditions related to `mtrx` elements and indices must still hold true.**
