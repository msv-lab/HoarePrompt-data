Example Answer:
`i1` is assigned the value `False` or `0`. The value of `i1` can be either `False` or `0` based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. President's desk colour c is an uppercase Latin letter. The office-room description is a matrix of size n x m where each cell contains either an uppercase Latin letter representing a desk colour or a period character '.' representing an empty cell. `i1` is either `False` or `0`.
