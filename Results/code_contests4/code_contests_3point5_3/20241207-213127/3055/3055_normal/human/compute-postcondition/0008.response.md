According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `k` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, President's desk colour `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `ii` is either `False` or 1, `iii` is False or 2, `k` is 0, `mtrx` is a 2D list with `n` empty lists inside, `frnds` is an empty set, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
