Postcondition: ***`frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `i+1` is less than `n`, `j` is increased by 1, `j` must be less than `m`, `mtrx[i - 1][j]` has been added to `frnds` if `i - 1 > 0`, `j - 1 > 0` is true, and the element at position `mtrx[i + 1][j]` has been added to `frnds` as well, as long as `j - 1 > 0` is true.***
