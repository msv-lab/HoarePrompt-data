According to the given code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `j` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` remain as described. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, then `frnds` contains the added element `mtrx[i][j + 1]` and `col`, `j` are updated accordingly. If `i + 1 < n`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds` contain the added element `mtrx[i + 1][j]` and `col`, `j` are updated accordingly.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the values of the variables need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` remain as described, if `j + 1 < m`, `j` is increased by 1**
