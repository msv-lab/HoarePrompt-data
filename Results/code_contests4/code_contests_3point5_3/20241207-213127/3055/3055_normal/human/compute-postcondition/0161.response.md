Output State: **`frnds` contains all unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, `mtrx[i + 1][j]`, `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]` have been added to `frnds`. The loop has executed for all valid positions in `mtrx` and `i`, `j` are within the specified bounds.**
