Example Answer:
The value at position `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is added to the set `frnds`. Since `i` is greater than 1, `i-1` is a valid index. The previous state of `frnds` is not provided, so the output state is: `frnds` contains the unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', and the newly added value.
Output State: **`frnds` contains the unique elements from the positions surrounding the cells in `mtrx` where the value equals `c` and is not equal to '.', and the newly added value**
