According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, to execute another time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So the adjusted state would be:
State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` remain as described, for the loop to execute another time `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is now incremented by 1**
