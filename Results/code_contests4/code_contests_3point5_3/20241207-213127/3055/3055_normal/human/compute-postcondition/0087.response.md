Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `ii`, `iii`, `k`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` remain as described. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, then `frnds` contains all elements from the adjacent positions in the matrix that meet the specified conditions. If `i - 1 > 0`, `i + 1 < n`, `j - 1 > 0`, `j + 1 < m`, all adjacent elements are added to `frnds`. Once the loop finishes, `frnds` will contain all valid adjacent elements based on the conditions checked during the iterations.**
