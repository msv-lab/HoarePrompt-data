n and m are positive integers representing the length and width of the office-room matrix, and c is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour. The office-room matrix contains n rows and m columns, with each cell either empty (represented by '.') or containing an uppercase Latin letter representing a desk colour. All desk colours are unique and each desk is a continuous subrectangle in the matrix.**
