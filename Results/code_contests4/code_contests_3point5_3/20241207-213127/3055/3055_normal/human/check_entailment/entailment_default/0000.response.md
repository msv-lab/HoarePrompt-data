Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. The code is attempting to count the number of unique desk colors surrounding the President's desk color, which is a correct approach. However, there are some issues with the code:
1. The condition `if i - 1 > 0:` and `if j - 1 > 0:` should be changed to `if i - 1 >= 0:` and `if j - 1 >= 0:` respectively to correctly check the boundaries of the matrix.
2. The condition `if '.' in frnds:` should be modified to `if '.' in frnds:` to ensure that the empty cells are removed before counting the number of President's deputies.
3. The code does not handle the case when the President's desk color is at the boundary of the office-room matrix correctly. This can lead to missing some deputies.

Therefore, the code is not fully correct and needs modifications to handle edge cases and fully comply with the problem description.
