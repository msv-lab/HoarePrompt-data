Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where the President's desk is on the edge of the office-room matrix. In this case, it should not count any deputies, however, the program will incorrectly count the adjacent desk on the other side of the edge. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3 3 Z
...
.H.
.Z.
```
The correct output should be 0, but the program will output 1 as it incorrectly counts the desk on the other side of the edge as a deputy.
