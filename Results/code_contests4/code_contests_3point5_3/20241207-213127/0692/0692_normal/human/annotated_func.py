#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(arr):
    days = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                days += 1
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, where `j` ranges from 1 to len(arr) - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr` of any data type. It iterates over the elements of `arr` and counts the number of times an element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`, where `j` ranges from 1 to len(arr) - 1. The function does not have a specified return value.
