You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n last days: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the price of berPhone on the day i.

Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6 and a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], then the number of days with a bad price is 3 — these are days 2 (a_2=9), 4 (a_4=6) and 5 (a_5=7).

Print the number of days with a bad price.

You have to answer t independent data sets.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of sets of input data in the test. Input data sets must be processed independently, one after another.

Each input data set consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of days. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), where a_i is the price on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all data sets in the test does not exceed 150000.

Output

Print t integers, the j-th of which should be equal to the number of days with a bad price in the j-th input data set.
