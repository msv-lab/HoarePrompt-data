According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the array `arr`. If the length of the array is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `days` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `days` is 0 and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`days` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` has at least 2 elements**
