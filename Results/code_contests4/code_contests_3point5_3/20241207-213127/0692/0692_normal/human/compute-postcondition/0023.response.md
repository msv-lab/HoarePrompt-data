Example Answer:
The value of `days` is increased by 1, and the value of `j` is not provided. Since the condition is based on `arr[i]` being greater than `arr[j]`, the actual value of `days` cannot be determined without knowing the exact values of `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`days` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1**
