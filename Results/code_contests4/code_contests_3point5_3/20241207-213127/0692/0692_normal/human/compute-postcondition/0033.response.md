Postcondition: ***`days` represents the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, at the start of the loop `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the length of `arr`. Additionally, after entering the if condition `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`***
