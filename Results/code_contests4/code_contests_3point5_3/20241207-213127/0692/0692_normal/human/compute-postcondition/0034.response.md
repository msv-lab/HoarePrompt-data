Output State: **`days` represents the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the length of `arr`, and after entering the if condition `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j`], `days` is incremented by 1**.
