According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the length of the list `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **`days` represents the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the length of `arr`**
