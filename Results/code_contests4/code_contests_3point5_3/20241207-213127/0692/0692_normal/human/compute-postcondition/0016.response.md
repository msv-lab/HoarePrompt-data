According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of arr minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `i` is 0, and `arr` has at least 2 elements. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `arr` needs to have at least 3 elements.
State: **`days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `i` is 1, `arr` has at least 3 elements**
