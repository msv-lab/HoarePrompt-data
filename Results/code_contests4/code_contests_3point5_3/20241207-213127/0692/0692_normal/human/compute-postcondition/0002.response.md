According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `arr` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `days` is 0 and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` needs to be 1, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`days` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` has at least 2 elements, `j` is 1**
