Example Answer:
The value of `days` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, and after entering the if condition `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, the total number of such occurrences increases by 1.
Output State: **`days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, increased by 1.**
