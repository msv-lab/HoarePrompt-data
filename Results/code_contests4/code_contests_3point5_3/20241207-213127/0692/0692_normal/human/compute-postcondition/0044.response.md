Postcondition: ***`days` represents the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, `days` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement breaks. `j` should be up to `len(arr) + 1 for the loop to execute one more time.***
