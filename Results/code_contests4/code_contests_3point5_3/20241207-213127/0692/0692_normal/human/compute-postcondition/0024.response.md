Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`days` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
