According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `arr` is at least 2. Since `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` should be set to 1.
State: **`days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` has at least 3 elements**
