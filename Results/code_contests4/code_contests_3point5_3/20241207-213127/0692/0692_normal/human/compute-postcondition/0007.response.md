According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is 1, `i` is 0, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and if the element at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the element at index `j`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
State: **`days` is 1, `i` is 0, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `j` is 2, and if the element at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the element at index `j`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
