According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than the length of the array `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, increased by 1 based on certain conditions. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, increased by 1 if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `j` is increased by 1**
