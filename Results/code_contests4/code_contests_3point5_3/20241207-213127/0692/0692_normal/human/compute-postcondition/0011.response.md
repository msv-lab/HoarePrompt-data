According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is an integer, `i` is 0, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `j` is 2. Since the loop increments `j` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than the length of `arr` after the adjustment.
State: **`days` is an integer, `i` is 0, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute one more time**
