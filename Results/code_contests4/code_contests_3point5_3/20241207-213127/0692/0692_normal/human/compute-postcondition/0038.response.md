Example Answer:
The value of `days` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `days` represents the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, the new value of `days` will be the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` represents the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the length of `arr` plus 1.
Output State: **`days` represents the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the length of `arr` plus 1**
