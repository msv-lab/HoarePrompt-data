According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `j` is increased by 1 if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and it should still be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **`days` is the total number of times `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` for all valid `i` and `j`, `j` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the length of `arr`**
