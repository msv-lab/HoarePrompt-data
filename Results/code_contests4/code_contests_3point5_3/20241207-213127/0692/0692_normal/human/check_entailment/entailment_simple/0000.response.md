Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only considers if the price on day 'i' is greater than the price on day 'j'. However, the problem description asks for the number of days where the price on day 'i' is greater than a price on any later day 'j'. This means that the program should compare the price on day 'i' with all prices on days after 'i', not just the price on the next day.

For example, if the input is [3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], the program will count 3 bad days (days 2, 4, and 5) which is correct. But if the input is [3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 9], the program will only count 1 bad day (day 1) when in fact there are 3 bad days (days 1, 4, and 5).

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description and is incorrect.
