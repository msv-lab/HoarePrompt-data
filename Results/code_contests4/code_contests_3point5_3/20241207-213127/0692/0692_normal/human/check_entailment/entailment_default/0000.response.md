Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` iterates over the elements of `arr` and counts the number of times an element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`, where `j` ranges from 1 to len(arr) - 1. However, this logic does not correctly identify the days with bad prices as per the problem description. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 9 4 6 7 5
```
According to the problem description, the number of days with a bad price should be 3, but the code will incorrectly output 5 because it counts the instances where an element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j` without considering the subsequent days with lower prices. This shows that the code is not correctly solving the problem.
