Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of days with a bad price as described in the problem. The nested loops in the `func_1` function are incorrect as they do not properly compare the prices of berPhone on subsequent days. 

Counterexample:
Input
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```

Expected Output: 
```
5
```

Explanation: In this case, the prices decrease each day, so all 5 days have a bad price. However, the given program will not count all 5 days as it only breaks out of the inner loop when it finds a bad day, not checking all subsequent days. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
