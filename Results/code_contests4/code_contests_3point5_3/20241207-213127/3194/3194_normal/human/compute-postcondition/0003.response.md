According to the code, the loop will execute 3 times, each time iterating over the 3 rows of the matrix. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already completed 3 iterations over the 3 rows of the matrix. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop should start again from the first row of the matrix.
State: **Input is a 3x3 matrix containing symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains the 3 rows of the matrix, for the loop to execute a fourth time `lines` should be reset to the first 3 rows of the matrix**
