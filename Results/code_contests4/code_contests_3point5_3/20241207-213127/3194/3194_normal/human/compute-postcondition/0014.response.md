Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input for a 3x3 matrix containing symbols 'X' and '.' only. It then checks specific positions in the matrix to determine if certain conditions are met. If any of these conditions are satisfied, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the output is directly printed to the console. **
