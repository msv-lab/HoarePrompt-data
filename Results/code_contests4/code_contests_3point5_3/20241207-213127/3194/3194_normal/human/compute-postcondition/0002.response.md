Example Answer:
The `lines` list is appended with the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. Since the input is a 3x3 matrix containing symbols 'X' and '.', the `lines` list will now contain the 3 rows of the matrix. 
Output State: **Input is a 3x3 matrix containing symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains the 3 rows of the matrix**
