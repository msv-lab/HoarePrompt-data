According to the code, the loop will execute for a total of 3 times since the range is 3. At the end of the last iteration, the matrix will contain the symbols 'X' and '.', and `lines` will contain the 3 rows of the matrix plus the newly appended line. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **Input is a 4x3 matrix containing symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains the 4 rows of the matrix plus the newly appended line**.
