Example Answer:
A new line is read from the input and appended to the `lines` list. Since `lines` already contained the 3 rows of the matrix, it now contains the 3 rows plus the newly read line. For the loop to execute a fourth time, `lines` should be reset to the first 3 rows of the matrix. 
Output State: **Input is a 3x3 matrix containing symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains the 3 rows of the matrix plus the newly appended line.**
