Correctness: **True**

The program reads a 3x3 matrix containing symbols 'X' and '.' only, which matches the input requirements stated in the problem description. It then checks specific positions in the matrix to determine if the password is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. If the conditions for symmetry are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO', which aligns with the output requirement in the problem description. The program correctly handles all cases where the password can or cannot be symmetric based on the given conditions.
