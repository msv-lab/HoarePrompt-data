The program correctly checks if the password entered is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. It checks for specific conditions where the password would not be symmetric and prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. This aligns with the problem description provided. The program covers all possible cases and correctly determines the symmetry of the password based on the conditions specified.
