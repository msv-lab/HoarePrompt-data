Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The problem description states that the input contains a 3x3 matrix with 'X' representing pressed buttons and '.' representing unpressed buttons. The code reads the input matrix correctly.
- The code then checks specific positions in the matrix to determine if the password is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal.
- If any of the conditions for symmetry are not met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
- The code handles all potential cases of symmetry as described in the problem statement.
- The output hints also confirm that the code is checking for symmetry correctly based on the positions of 'X' in the input matrix.
