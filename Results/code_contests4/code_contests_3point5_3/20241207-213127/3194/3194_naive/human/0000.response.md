Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input matrix and checks if the password is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. It covers all the possible symmetric cases mentioned in the problem description. Since the program works as expected for all potential cases, we can conclude that it is correct.
