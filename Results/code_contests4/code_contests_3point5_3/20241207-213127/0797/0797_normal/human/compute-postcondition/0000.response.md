Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values by splitting the input. The values of N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= K <= 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= K <= 10^18.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= K <= 10^18**
