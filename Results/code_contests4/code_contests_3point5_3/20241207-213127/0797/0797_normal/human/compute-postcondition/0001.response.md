Example Answer:
The code calculates the minimum value between the remainder of N divided by K and K minus the remainder of N divided by K. Since N and K are non-negative integers, the result will be a non-negative integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= K <= 10^18, the minimum value between the remainder of N divided by K and K minus the remainder of N divided by K is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= K <= 10^18, the minimum value between the remainder of N divided by K and K minus the remainder of N divided by K is a non-negative integer**
