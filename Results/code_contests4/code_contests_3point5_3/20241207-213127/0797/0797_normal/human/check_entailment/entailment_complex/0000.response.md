Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two non-negative integers N and K from the user input, then calculates and prints the minimum of N modulo K and K minus N modulo K, which corresponds to the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times. The program operates within the specified constraints and always produces the correct output based on the problem description.
