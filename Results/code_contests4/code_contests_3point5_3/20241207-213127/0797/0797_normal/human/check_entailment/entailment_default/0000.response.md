Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads two non-negative integers N and K from the user input.
- It then calculates and prints the minimum of N modulo K and K minus N modulo K, which is in line with the problem description.
- The code operates on the non-negative integers N and K within the specified constraints.
- The logic of finding the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times is implemented correctly in the code.
