Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description. The function `func_1` in the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal. In particular, the condition `if n % 2 == 0:` is not a valid check for determining if the number of cells is odd or even. Additionally, the calculation of `moves` and `M` is not appropriate for the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program does not work as expected and does not meet the problem description, making the correctness false.
