Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the given problem description. 

One potential case where the program fails to produce the correct output is when:
Input:
2 3 1
2 3

Expected Output:
0

Explanation:
In this case, the program should return 0 as Joe can act as follows:
- During the first period of time, Joe moves a diamond from the 1st cell to the 2nd one and a diamond from the 3rd cell to his pocket. By the end of the first period, the diamonds' positions are 3 2 2. The security system does not go off.
- During the second period, Joe moves a diamond from the 3rd cell to the 2nd one and puts a diamond from the 1st cell to his pocket. By the end of the second period, the diamonds' positions are 2 3 1. The security system does not go off. Now Joe leaves with 2 diamonds in his pocket.

However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly and does not produce the expected output of 0.
