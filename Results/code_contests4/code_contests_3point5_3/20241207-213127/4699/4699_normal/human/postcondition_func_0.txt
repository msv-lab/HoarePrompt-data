The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `A`, `m`, and `k`. `A` is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in each cell. `m` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^9. The function then proceeds as follows:
- If the length of list A is 1, the function returns the minimum value between the amount of diamonds in the first cell of list A and the product of `m` and `k`.
- If the length of list A is even, the function returns 0.
- If the number of moves calculated based on the length of A is greater than `m`, the function returns 0.
- Otherwise, the function returns the minimum value between the minimum amount of diamonds in every other cell of A and the result of dividing `m` by moves and multiplying by `k`.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` involves handling different cases based on the length of A and the value of m.
