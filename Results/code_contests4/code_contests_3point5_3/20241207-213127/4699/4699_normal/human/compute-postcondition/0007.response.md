Example Answer:
The value of `moves` is calculated by dividing `n` by 2 and adding 1. Since `n` is an odd number and not equal to 1, the result of the division will be an integer value. Therefore, `moves` will be a positive integer. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`A` is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in each cell, `m` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^9; `n` is the length of list A, `moves` is a positive integer**
