The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `A`, `m`, and `k`. 

Parameter `A` is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in each cell. Parameters `m` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^9.

After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the following cases:

Case_1: The program returns the minimum value between the amount of diamonds in the first cell of list A and the product of `m` and `k`.

Case_2: The program returns 0.

Case_3: The program returns 0.

Case_4: The program returns the minimum value between `m` and the result of the division of `m` by moves multiplied by `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `A`, and two positive integers `m` and `k`, and return different values based on the specified cases.
