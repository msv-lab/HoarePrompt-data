Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal without triggering the security system. However, the code has some issues:
1. The condition for checking if the length of list `A` is even and returning 0 is incorrect. The problem description does not mention anything about returning 0 if the length of the list is even. This logic is not consistent with the problem requirements.
2. The calculation of `moves` is flawed. The formula `moves = n / 2 + 1` should be `moves = n // 2 + 1` to ensure that the number of moves is calculated correctly.
3. The return statement `return min(M, m / moves * k)` is incorrect. It should be `return min(M, m // moves * k)` to ensure correct integer division.

Therefore, based on the discrepancies between the code and the problem description, the correctness of the code is **False**.
