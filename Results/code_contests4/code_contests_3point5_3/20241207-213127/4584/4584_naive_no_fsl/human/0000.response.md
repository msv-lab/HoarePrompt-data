Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes input for the number of ordered bottles, volume of each bottle, and number of friends. It then distributes the milk among the cups ensuring that the milk from each bottle is in no more than two different cups. The program checks all possible cases and outputs whether it is possible to pour the milk as required. The logic of distributing the milk among the cups seems correct and follows the problem description for all cases. The program also handles different scenarios such as checking if the bottle is empty, cup is full, and distributing the milk accordingly. The output format also matches the requirements specified in the problem description. Overall, the program appears to be correct.
