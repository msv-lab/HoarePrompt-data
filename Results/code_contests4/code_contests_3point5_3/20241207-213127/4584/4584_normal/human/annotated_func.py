    if (x < 0) :

    return x < eps
    #The program returns True if the value of x is less than eps, otherwise it returns False. The values of n, w, and m are within the specified ranges, and x is greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter x and returns True if x is less than the value of eps. However, the annotations mention conditions related to x being less than 0, which are not reflected in the code. The code does not handle the case when x is negative. Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is to return True if x is less than eps and False otherwise, assuming x is a non-negative integer.

If `bottle.milk` <= `space_in_cup`, `cup.milk` is increased by `bottle.milk`, `cup.ingredients` contains the tuple `(bottle.no, bottle.milk)`, and `bottle.milk` is set to 0.0. If `bottle.milk` > `space_in_cup`, `bottle.milk` is decreased by `space_in_cup`, `cup.milk` is set to `cup.capacity`, and `cup.ingredients` contains a tuple with `bottle.no` and `space_in_cup`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `bottle` and `cup`, where 1 <= bottle <= 50 and 2 <= cup <= 50. If the `bottle` is not empty and the `cup` is not full, it transfers milk from the bottle to the cup based on the available space. If the milk in the bottle can fit entirely into the cup, the milk is transferred, and the bottle becomes empty. If there is not enough space in the cup, the remaining milk stays in the bottle, and the cup becomes full. The function returns True after the milk transfer is completed. If either the bottle is empty or the cup is full, the function returns False.

    #The program returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list 'cups'. The index of the last full cup before the first empty cup or 'm-1' is stored in 'ci', 'm' is an integer, 'bi' and 'bottle' are integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` initializes bottles and cups with certain properties based on the input parameters `n`, `w`, and `m`. It then iterates through the bottles and cups, calling `func_2` with certain conditions. If a specific condition is met, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list 'cups'. The index of the last full cup before the first empty cup or 'm-1' is stored in 'ci'.
