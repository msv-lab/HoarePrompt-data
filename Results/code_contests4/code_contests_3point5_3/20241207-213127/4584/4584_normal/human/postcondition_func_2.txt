The function `func_3` initializes bottles and cups with certain properties based on the input parameters `n`, `w`, and `m`. It then iterates through the bottles and cups, calling `func_2` with certain conditions. If a specific condition is met, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list 'cups'. The index of the last full cup before the first empty cup or 'm-1' is stored in 'ci'.
