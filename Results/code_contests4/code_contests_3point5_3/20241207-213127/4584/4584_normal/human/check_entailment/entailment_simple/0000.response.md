Correctness: **True**

The program defines three functions that work together to distribute the milk among the cups according to the problem description. 

- Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if a given integer is less than a small epsilon value. This is not directly related to the problem description, but it is used in the program.
- Function 2 (`func_2`) takes a bottle and a cup, then pours milk from the bottle into the cup while ensuring that each bottle's milk is in no more than two different cups. It correctly distributes the milk among the cups as required.
- Function 3 (`func_3`) creates a list of bottles, sets the capacity of each cup, creates a list of cups, and then iterates over the bottles pouring milk into the cups using `func_2`. It then returns a list of ingredients for each cup.

The program ensures that each bottle's milk is poured into no more than two different cups as specified in the problem description. It correctly handles the distribution of milk among the cups and outputs the result in the required format. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
