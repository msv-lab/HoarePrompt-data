The function func_1 accepts a parameter x and returns True if x is less than the value of eps. However, the annotations mention conditions related to x being less than 0, which are not reflected in the code. The code does not handle the case when x is negative. Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is to return True if x is less than eps and False otherwise, assuming x is a non-negative integer.
