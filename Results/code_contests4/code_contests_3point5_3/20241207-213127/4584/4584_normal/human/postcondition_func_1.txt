The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `bottle` and `cup`, where 1 <= bottle <= 50 and 2 <= cup <= 50. If the `bottle` is not empty and the `cup` is not full, it transfers milk from the bottle to the cup based on the available space. If the milk in the bottle can fit entirely into the cup, the milk is transferred, and the bottle becomes empty. If there is not enough space in the cup, the remaining milk stays in the bottle, and the cup becomes full. The function returns True after the milk transfer is completed. If either the bottle is empty or the cup is full, the function returns False.
