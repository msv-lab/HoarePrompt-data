According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `bi` and `n`. If `bi` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ci` is equal to or greater than `m`, the cup at index `ci-1` is not full. So for the loop to execute one more time, `bi` needs to be increased by 1 and must be less than `n`.
State: **`ci` is equal to or greater than `m`, the cup at index `ci-1` is not full, `bi` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute again `bi` must be less than `n`**
