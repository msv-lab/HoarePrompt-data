According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `bi` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a list of `m` Cup objects is created does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `bi` is 0. 
State: **A list of `m` Cup objects is created, `ci` is 0, `bi` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
