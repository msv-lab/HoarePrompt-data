Example Answer:
`bottle` is assigned the value from the list `bottles` at index `bi`. The values of `ci`, `m`, `bi` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ci` is the index of the last full cup before the first empty cup or `m-1`, `m`, `bi` is the next integer after the last value assigned to `bi`, `bottle` is an integer.
Output State: **`ci` is the index of the last full cup before the first empty cup or `m-1`, `m`, `bi` is the next integer after the last value assigned to `bi`, `bottle` is an integer**
