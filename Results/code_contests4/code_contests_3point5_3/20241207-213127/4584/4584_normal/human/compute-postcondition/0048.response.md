According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci`, `m`, and the `is_full()` method of cups[ci]. If `ci + 1` is less than `m` and cups[ci] is full, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ci`, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are variables, and there is no direct impact from the function call `func_2(bottle, cups[ci])`. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `ci + 1` needs to be less than `m` and cups[ci] needs to be full. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `ci + 1` should be less than `m` and cups[ci] should be full for the loop to execute the first time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`ci`, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are variables, for the loop to execute the first time `ci + 1` should be less than `m` and cups[ci] should be full**
