Example Answer:
`ci` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain the same. The loop will execute one more time only if `ci + 1 < m` and `cups[ci+1].is_full()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ci` is incremented by 1, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers, and the loop will execute one more time if `ci + 1 < m` and `cups[ci+1].is_full()`.
Output State: **`ci` is incremented by 1, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers, and the loop will execute one more time if `ci + 1 < m` and `cups[ci+1].is_full()`**
