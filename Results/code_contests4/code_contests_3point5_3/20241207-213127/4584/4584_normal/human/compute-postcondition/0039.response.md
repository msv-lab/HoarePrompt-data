According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `bi` and `n`. If `bi` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ci` is the index of the last full cup before the first empty cup or `m-1`, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `bi` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`ci` is the index of the last full cup before the first empty cup or `m-1`, `m`, `bi` is the next integer after the last value assigned to `bi`, `bottle` is an integer**
