Example Answer:
`bottles` is assigned a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights `w` ranging from 100 to 1000. The values of `n`, `w`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50, 100 <= w <= 1000, and 2 <= m <= 50, and `bottles` is a list of Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50, 100 <= w <= 1000, and 2 <= m <= 50, and `bottles` is a list of Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000**
