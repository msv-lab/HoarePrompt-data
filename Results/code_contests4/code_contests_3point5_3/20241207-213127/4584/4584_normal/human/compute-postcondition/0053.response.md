Example Answer:
`ci` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again only if the new value of `ci` is less than `m`. The value of `ci` is increased by 1, so the condition `ci + 1 < m` still holds true. The variable `cups[ci]` being full has no impact on the code execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `ci` is `ci + 2`, for the loop to execute again `ci + 2` is less than `m` and cups[ci] is full.
Output State: **`ci` is `ci + 2`, for the loop to execute again `ci + 2` is less than `m` and cups[ci] is full**
