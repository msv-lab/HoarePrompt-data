Example Answer:
The value of `ci` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ci` is unknown, so the new value of `ci` is `ci + 1`. The conditions for the loop to execute again are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `ci` is incremented by 1, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ci + 2 < m` and `cups[ci].is_full()`.
Output State: **`ci` is incremented by 1, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ci + 2 < m` and `cups[ci].is_full()`**
