Example Answer:
The variable `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`. Since `bi` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration and must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again, the value of `bottle` will be the next bottle in the list `bottles` for the next iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`ci` is equal to or greater than `m`, the cup at index `ci-1` is not full, `bi` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `bottle` is assigned the next bottle in the list `bottles` for the next iteration.**
