According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci`, `m`, and the `is_full()` method of the Cup object. If `ci + 1` is less than `m` and the `is_full()` method of the Cup object at index `ci` returns true, the loop can execute. 

Right before the loop, `ci` is 0, `m` Cups objects are created, `bi` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`, and if `bottle` is not empty, `func_2` is executed. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. `ci` needs to be incremented by 1 to make `ci + 1` less than `m`.
2. The Cup object at index `ci` needs to be not full for the loop to proceed.

State: **A list of `m` Cup objects is created, `ci` is 1, `bi` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`, if `bottle` is not empty, `func_2` is executed, and the Cup object at index `ci-1` is not full**
