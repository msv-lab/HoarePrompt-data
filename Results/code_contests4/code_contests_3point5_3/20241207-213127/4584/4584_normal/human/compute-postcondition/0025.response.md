Example Answer:
Calling `func_2` with parameters `bottle` and `cups[ci]`. The function `func_2` will perform operations based on these parameters, but the impact on the initial state variables is not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `ci` is equal to or greater than `m`, the cup at index `ci-1` is not full, `bi` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `bottle` is assigned the next bottle in the list `bottles` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`ci` is equal to or greater than `m`, the cup at index `ci-1` is not full, `bi` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `bottle` is assigned the next bottle in the list `bottles` for the next iteration**
