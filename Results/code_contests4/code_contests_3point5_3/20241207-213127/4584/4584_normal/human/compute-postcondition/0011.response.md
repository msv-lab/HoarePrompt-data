Example Answer:
`func_2` is called with parameters `bottle` and `cups[ci + 1]`. The function `func_2` is executed with the given parameters. The values of the variables `m`, `ci`, and `bi` remain the same. The loop will continue as long as `ci + 1` is less than or equal to `m`. 
Output State: **A list of `m` Cup objects is created, `ci` is 0, `bi` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`, `bottle` is not empty, `func_2` is executed with the given parameters.**
