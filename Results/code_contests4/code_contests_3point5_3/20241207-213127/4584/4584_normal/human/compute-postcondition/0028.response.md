Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci + 1]`. If `ci + 1` is greater than `m`, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, the function returns None. The states of the variables `ci`, `m`, `bi`, and `bottle` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `ci`, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers.
Output State: **`ci`, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers**
