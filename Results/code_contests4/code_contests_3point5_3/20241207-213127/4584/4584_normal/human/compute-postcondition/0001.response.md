Example Answer:
The capacity of the Cup object is calculated as the result of dividing the product of `n` and `w` by `m`. Given the constraints, the values of `n`, `w`, and `m` fall within the specified ranges. Therefore, the capacity of the Cup is a floating-point number. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **Capacity of the Cup object is a floating-point number**
