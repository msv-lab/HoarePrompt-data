According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci`, `m`, and the state of the cup at index `ci`. If `ci + 1 < m` and the cup at index `ci` is full, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ci`, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers. The bottle being not empty ensures that the loop will not execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the bottle is empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ci`, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers, for the loop to execute the first time the bottle is empty**
