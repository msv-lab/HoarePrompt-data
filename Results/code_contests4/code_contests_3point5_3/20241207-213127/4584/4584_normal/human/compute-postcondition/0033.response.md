Example Answer:
`ci` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ci` is unknown, so after execution, `ci` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ci` is incremented by 1, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers, for the loop to execute the first time the bottle is empty.
Output State: **`ci` is incremented by 1, `m`, `bi`, `bottle` are integers, for the loop to execute the first time the bottle is empty**
