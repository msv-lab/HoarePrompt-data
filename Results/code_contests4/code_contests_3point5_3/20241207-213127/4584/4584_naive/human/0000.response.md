Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input data and validates the input constraints.
2. The program defines classes for Bottle and Cup, which encapsulate the properties and behaviors related to milk distribution.
3. The program implements functions to check if a bottle is empty, if a cup is empty, full, or has space left, and to distribute milk from a bottle to a cup.
4. The main function func_3 uses the above-defined classes and functions to distribute the milk among the cups according to the specified constraints.
5. The program outputs "YES" if a solution is found, and "NO" otherwise, as per the problem description.
6. The program handles the distribution of milk among the cups correctly and ensures that each bottle's milk is poured into at most two different cups.
7. The output format also matches the requirements specified in the problem description.
