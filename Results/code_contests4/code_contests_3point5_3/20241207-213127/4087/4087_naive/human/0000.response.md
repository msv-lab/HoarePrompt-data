Correctness: **False**

The given Python program is incorrect because it does not provide the correct output for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used in the program to calculate the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k is flawed. The program uses a combination formula to calculate the number of subsequences, but the implementation is incorrect.

For example, when the input sequence is [1, 2, 1, 3] and n=3, the program fails to correctly calculate the number of subsequences with length k for all k=1,...,n+1. This leads to incorrect output, indicating that the program is not handling all potential cases as required by the problem description.
