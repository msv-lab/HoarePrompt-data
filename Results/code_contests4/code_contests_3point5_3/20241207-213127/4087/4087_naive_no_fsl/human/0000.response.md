Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not align with the problem description. The calculation of `ans` and `x` is incorrect, which leads to incorrect results being printed.

Additionally, the program does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description. For example, if there are duplicate values in the input sequence, the program will not work correctly. This is because the program relies on finding the index of a value in the input sequence, which may not work correctly with duplicates.

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
