According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of `tmp`, `tmp` is 1, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` should be 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of `tmp`, `tmp` is 1, `i` is 2**
