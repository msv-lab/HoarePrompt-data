Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i**
