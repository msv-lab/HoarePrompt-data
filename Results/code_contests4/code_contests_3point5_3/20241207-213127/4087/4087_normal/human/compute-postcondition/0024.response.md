According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is assigned the value of `i`, `right` is the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with the factorials of the indexes, `tmp` is the factorial of n + 1, `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]`, and `a[i]` is in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1. After the execution of the if else block, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
