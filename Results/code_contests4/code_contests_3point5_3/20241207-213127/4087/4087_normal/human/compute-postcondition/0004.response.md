Example Answer:
The variable `mask` is assigned the value 10^9 + 7. The values of other variables `n`, `a`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `mask` is 10^9 + 7.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `mask` is 10^9 + 7**
