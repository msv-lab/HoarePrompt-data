Example Answer:
`x` is reassigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`. The value of `a[i]` is already present in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 1, `right` is the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with the factorials of the indexes, `tmp` is the factorial of n + 1, `x` is reassigned the index of `a[i]`, and `a[i]` is in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`. Upon exiting the if else block, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.
