According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, which means `i` will be 2. 
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 1, `right` is the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with the factorials of the indexes, `tmp` is the factorial of n + 1, `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]`, and `a[i]` is in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`. Upon exiting the if else block, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.**
