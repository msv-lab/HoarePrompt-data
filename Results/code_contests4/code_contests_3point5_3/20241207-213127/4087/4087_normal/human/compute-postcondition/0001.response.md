Example Answer:
The code snippet uses the `map` function to convert the input values separated by spaces into a list of integers. The `re.split('\\s', raw_input())` is used to split the input string at each space. Since the initial state does not specify the initial values of `a_i`, we cannot determine the specific values of the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
