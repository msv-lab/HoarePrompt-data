According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the values of `left`, `right`, `mask`, `pow`, and `tmp` do not affect the loop execution directly. However, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` should be at least 1 and `i` should be 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with zeros, `tmp` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
