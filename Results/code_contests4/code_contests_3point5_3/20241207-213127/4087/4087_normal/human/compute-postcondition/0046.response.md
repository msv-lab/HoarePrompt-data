Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is calculated using the formula provided. Adjusting the value of `i` to execute the loop one more time will change the result of the calculation. Since the specific values of `n` and `i` are not provided, the output state will depend on the updated value of `i`.
Output State: **The specific output state will depend on the updated value of `i`.**
