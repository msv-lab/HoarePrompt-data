Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 2, `right` is the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with the factorials of the indexes, `tmp` is the factorial of n + 1, `x` is reassigned the index of `a[i]`, and `a[i]` is in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`. Upon exiting the if else block, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.**
