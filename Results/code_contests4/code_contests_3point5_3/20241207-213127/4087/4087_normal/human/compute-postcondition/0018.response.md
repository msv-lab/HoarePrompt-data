Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`. The variables `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with the factorials of the indexes, `tmp` is the factorial of n + 1, `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]`.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with the factorials of the indexes, `tmp` is the factorial of n + 1, `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]`**
