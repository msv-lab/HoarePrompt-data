According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1 so i will be 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 1.
State: **i is 2, n is greater than 1, ans is n + 1, x is calculated based on specific values of left, right, n, and i**
