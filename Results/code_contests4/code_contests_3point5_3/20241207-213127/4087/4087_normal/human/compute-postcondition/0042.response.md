Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`, where `pow` represents the power function. The value of `ans` is calculated based on the specific values of `n` and `i`. The initial values of `i` and `n` are known to be 2 and greater than 1 respectively. Therefore, after execution, the value of `ans` is determined based on these values. The value of `x` is calculated based on specific values of `left`, `right`, `n`, and `i`, which are not given in the initial state. 
Output State: **i is 2, n is greater than 1, ans is calculated based on specific values of n and i, x is calculated based on specific values of left, right, n, and i**
