Example Answer:
The code calculates ans as the result of `(n + 1) choose i`, which is the number of ways to choose i elements from a set of size n + 1. Since i is 1 and n is greater than 0, the value of ans is simply n + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: i is 1, n is greater than 0, ans is n + 1.
Output State: **i is 1, n is greater than 0, ans is n + 1**
