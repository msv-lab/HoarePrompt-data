Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value 0. The value of `right` is directly set to 0, so no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0**
