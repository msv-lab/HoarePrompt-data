According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the specific values of left, right, n, i, ans, x, and mask are not provided. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, to execute one more time `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **Adjust the value of `i` to execute the loop one more time**
