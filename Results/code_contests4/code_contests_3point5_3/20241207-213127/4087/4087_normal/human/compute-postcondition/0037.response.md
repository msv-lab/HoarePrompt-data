According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to n + 1. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 1. Additionally, since `i` starts from 1, it needs to be set to 1 at the beginning of the loop. 
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, other variables remain the same for the loop to execute the first time**
