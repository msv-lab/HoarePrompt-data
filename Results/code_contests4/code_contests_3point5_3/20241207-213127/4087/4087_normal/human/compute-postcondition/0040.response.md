Example Answer:
The code calculates ans - x, then takes the modulo operation with the value of mask. As per the initial state, ans is n + 1, and x is calculated based on specific values of left, right, n, and i. The specific values of left, right, n, and i are not provided, so the exact value of x cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: i is 1, n is greater than 0, ans is n + 1, x is calculated based on specific values of left, right, n, and i.
Output State: **i is 1, n is greater than 0, ans is n + 1, x is calculated based on specific values of left, right, n, and i**
