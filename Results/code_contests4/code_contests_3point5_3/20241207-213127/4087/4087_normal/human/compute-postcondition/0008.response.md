Example Answer:
`tmp` is multiplied by `i`, where `i` is 1. So, `tmp` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with zeros, `tmp` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with zeros, `tmp` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
