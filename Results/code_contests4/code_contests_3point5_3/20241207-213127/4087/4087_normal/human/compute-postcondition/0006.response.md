Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the value 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with zeros, `tmp` is 1.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with zeros, `tmp` is 1**
