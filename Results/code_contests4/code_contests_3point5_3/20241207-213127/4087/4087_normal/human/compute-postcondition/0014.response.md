Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list of integers with length n + 2 filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of `tmp`, `tmp` is 1, `i` is 3, `tmp` is multiplied by `i`, `pow[i]` is now equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.**
