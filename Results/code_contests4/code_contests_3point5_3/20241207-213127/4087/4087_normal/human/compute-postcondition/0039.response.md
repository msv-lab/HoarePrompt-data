Example Answer:
The value of x is calculated based on the values of left, right, n, and i. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for left and right, we cannot determine the exact value of x. Therefore, the Output State is: i is 1, n is greater than 0, ans is n + 1, and x is calculated based on specific values of left, right, n, and i.
Output State: **i is 1, n is greater than 0, ans is n + 1, and x is calculated based on specific values of left, right, n, and i**
