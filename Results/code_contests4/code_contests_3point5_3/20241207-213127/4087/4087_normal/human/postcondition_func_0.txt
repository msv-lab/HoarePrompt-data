The function reads an integer input n and a list of n integers. It then calculates specific indexes based on the input list and factorials. Finally, it attempts to perform division and print results but due to the incorrect use of the modulo operator `%`, the code will raise a syntax error. The functionality is incomplete and does not produce the intended squared integers output.
