Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

1. The program does not correctly calculate the factorials using the list `pow`. The `pow` list should be used to store pre-calculated factorials, but the calculation of factorials in the for loop is incorrect.

2. The division operation in Python 2.x results in integer division if both operands are integers. This might lead to incorrect results as the program calculates combinations using factorials.

3. The modulo operation `%` is used in an incorrect way. The correct way to perform a modulo operation in Python is by using the `%` operator. The program uses `%` after the print statement which is incorrect.

Overall, the program does not correctly calculate the number of different subsequences as required by the problem description.
