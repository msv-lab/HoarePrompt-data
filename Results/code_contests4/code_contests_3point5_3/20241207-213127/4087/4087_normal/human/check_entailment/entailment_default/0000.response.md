Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints indicate that the program should calculate the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7. However, the code does not seem to be correctly implementing this logic.

One potential issue is that the code tries to calculate the factorial of n+1 for each element in the sequence, but it does not properly handle the modulo operation. The line `print(ans - x) % mask` will raise a syntax error and does not correctly implement the modulo operation as intended in the problem description.

Additionally, the code logic for finding the indices `left` and `right` based on the input list `a` might not cover all possible cases where the same integer appears multiple times in the sequence.

Therefore, based on the discrepancies between the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be false.
