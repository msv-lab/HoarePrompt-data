You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are playing the game "Arranging The Sheep". The goal of this game is to make the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one square to the right, if the corresponding square exists and is empty. The game ends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty cells between any sheep.

For example, if n=6 and the level is described by the string "**.*..", then the following game scenario is possible: 

  * the sheep at the 4 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "**..*."; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "*.*.*."; 
  * the sheep at the 1 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ".**.*."; 
  * the sheep at the 3 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ".*.**."; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "..***."; 
  * the sheep are lined up and the game ends. 



For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

The second line of each test case contains a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep) — the description of the level.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case output the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
    af = []
    for zorg in range(int(le.pop())):
        n = int(le.pop())
        
        l = le.pop()
        
        l = [k for k in range(n) if l[k] == '*']
        
        l = [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]
        
        if l:
            med = l[len(l) // 2]
            af.append(sum(abs(k - med) for k in l))
        else:
            af.append(0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `le` is an empty list, `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med` for each iteration of the loop, `zorg` is the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `med` is the middle element of `l` which is also empty
    print('\n'.join(map(str, af)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input, processes the data according to certain rules, and prints the results to the standard output. It involves iterating over a specified number of test cases, extracting data, calculating the sum of absolute differences based on specific criteria, and outputting the results. However, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
