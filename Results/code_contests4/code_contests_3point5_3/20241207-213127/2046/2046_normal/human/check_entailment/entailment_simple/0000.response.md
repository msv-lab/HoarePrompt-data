Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, calculates the minimum number of moves needed to line up the sheep for each test case, and prints the result. 

It iterates through each test case, finds the positions of the sheep, calculates the absolute differences between each sheep's position and the middle position, and sums up those differences to get the minimum number of moves required.

The program handles the cases where there are no sheep in the level (resulting in 0 moves needed) and where there is an odd number of sheep (calculating the middle position correctly).

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input.
