Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem described. It reads input from the standard input, processes the data according to the rules of the game, calculates the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level, and outputs the results. The program iterates over the specified number of test cases, extracts the necessary data, calculates the sum of absolute differences based on the specific criteria mentioned in the problem description, and prints the results.

The program correctly handles each test case by identifying the positions of the sheep ('*'), calculating the absolute differences between the positions, finding the middle position, and summing the absolute differences to determine the minimum number of moves required. The output of the program matches the expected output for the provided test cases.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and can be considered correct.
