Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not align with the problem description for all potential cases. It seems to be calculating the sum of absolute differences based on the positions of the sheep in the input string. However, the code does not accurately simulate the game scenario as described in the problem. It does not consider the rule that in one move, a sheep can only move one square to the left or one square to the right if the corresponding square exists and is empty. 

For example, consider the test case where n=6 and the level is described by the string "**.*..". The code will not provide the correct minimum number of moves needed to complete the level as it doesn't follow the game rules specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
