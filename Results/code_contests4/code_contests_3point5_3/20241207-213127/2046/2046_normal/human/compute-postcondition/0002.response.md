According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `int(le.pop())`. If the result is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `le` is a list containing the reversed input lines does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `zorg` is 0 and `af` is an empty list.
State: **`le` is a list containing the reversed input lines, `af` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `zorg` is 0**
