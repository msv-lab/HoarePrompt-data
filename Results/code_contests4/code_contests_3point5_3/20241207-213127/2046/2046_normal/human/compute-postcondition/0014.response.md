Example Answer:
The integer value `n` is assigned the value popped from the `le` list, so `n` now holds the second last element of the original `le` list. The list `le` has been modified by removing the last element. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `le` is a list containing the reversed input lines without the last two elements, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med`, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the second last element of the original `le` list, `l` is the result of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]. If `l` is empty, `af` is a list containing 0.
