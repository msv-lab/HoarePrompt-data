Postcondition: ***`le` is a list containing the reversed input lines without the last element, `af` is a list. If `l` is not empty, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med`, where `med` is the middle element of list `l`. `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element of the original `le` list. `l` is the result of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]. If `l` is empty, `af` is a list containing 0.***
