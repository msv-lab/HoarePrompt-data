Example Answer: 
A new empty list `af` is created. The variable `le` containing the reversed input lines is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `le` is a list containing the reversed input lines, `af` is an empty list.
Output State: **`le` is a list containing the reversed input lines, `af` is an empty list**
