Postcondition: ***`le` is a list containing the reversed input lines without the last two elements, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med`, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the second last element of the original `le` list, `l` is the result of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]. If `l` is not empty, then `med` is the middle element of the list `l`, otherwise `af` has an additional element 0 appended to it.***
