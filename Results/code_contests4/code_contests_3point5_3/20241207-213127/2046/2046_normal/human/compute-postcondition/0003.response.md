Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(le.pop())`. The `pop()` method removes and returns the last item from the list `le`, which is then converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. The initial state shows `le` as a list containing the reversed input lines, so `n` will be the last element of that list as an integer. The list `af` remains empty, and `zorg` remains 0.
Output State: **`le` is a list containing the reversed input lines without the last element, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element of the original `le` list**
