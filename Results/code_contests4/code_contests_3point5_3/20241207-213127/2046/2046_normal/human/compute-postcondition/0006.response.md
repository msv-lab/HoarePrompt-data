Example Answer:
The list comprehension calculates the difference between each element `b` and its index `a` in the list `l`. Since `l` is the popped element from `le`, the values in `l` are used for this calculation. The result of the list comprehension is stored back in `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `le` is a list containing the reversed input lines without the last element, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element of the original `le` list, `l` is the result of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)].
Output State: **`le` is a list containing the reversed input lines without the last element, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element of the original `le` list, `l` is the result of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]**
