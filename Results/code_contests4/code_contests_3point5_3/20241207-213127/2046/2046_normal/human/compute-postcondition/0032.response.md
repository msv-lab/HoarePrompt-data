Example Answer:
The code prints each element of the list `af` after converting them to strings and joining them with a newline character. As `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med` for each iteration of the loop, the output will be the elements of `af` separated by newlines. However, as the initial state has `le` as an empty list, `af` as a list containing the sum of absolute differences, `zorg` as the number of loop iterations, `n` as 0, `l` as an empty list, and `med` as an empty list, the output will be an empty string as there are no elements in `af` to print.
Output State: **Empty string**
