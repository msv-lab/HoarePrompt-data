Example Answer:
The sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med` is calculated and appended to the list `af`. This sum is computed by taking the absolute difference between each element `k` of `l` and the middle element `med`. The variables `le`, `zorg`, `n`, `l`, and `med` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `le` is a list containing the reversed input lines without the last two elements, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med`, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the second last element of the original `le` list, `l` is the result of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)], `med` is the middle element of the list `l`.
Output State: **`le` is a list containing the reversed input lines without the last two elements, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med`, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the second last element of the original `le` list, `l` is the result of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)], `med` is the middle element of the list `l`**
