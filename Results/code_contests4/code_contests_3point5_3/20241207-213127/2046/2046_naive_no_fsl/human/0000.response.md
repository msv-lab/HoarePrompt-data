Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case as described in the problem, and calculates the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level. It correctly handles cases where there are no sheep in the level. The logic used to calculate the minimum moves seems to be correct based on the problem description. There are no potential cases provided where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program can be considered correct.
