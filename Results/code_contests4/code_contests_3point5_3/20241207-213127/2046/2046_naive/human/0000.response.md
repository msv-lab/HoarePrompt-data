Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input format with the number of test cases, length of the string, and the string itself.
- For each test case, it calculates the positions of the sheep, calculates the distance of each sheep from the median position, and sums the absolute differences.
- The program then outputs the minimum number of moves required to line up the sheep.
- The logic of finding the median sheep position and calculating the total moves based on the distances is correct and aligns with the problem description.
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently and provides the correct output.
