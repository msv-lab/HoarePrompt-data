According to the code, the loop will iterate from 0 to 9 (10 times) based on the range(10). At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is updated based on user input and `i` is 1. Since `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`k` is updated based on the user input, `i` is 2**
