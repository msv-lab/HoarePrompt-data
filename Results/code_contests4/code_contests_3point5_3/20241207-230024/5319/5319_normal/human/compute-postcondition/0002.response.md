Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `k + int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial value of `k` is 0, so after execution, `k` will be updated based on the input value. The initial value of `i` is 0 and it is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated based on the user input, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`k` is updated based on the user input, `i` is 0**
