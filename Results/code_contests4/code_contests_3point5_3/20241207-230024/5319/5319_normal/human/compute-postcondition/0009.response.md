The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a list of 10 integers representing the scores of each problem, where each score si is an integer such that 0 ≤ si ≤ 100. The function calculates and returns the total score obtained by summing up all the individual scores. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the total score obtained from a list of 10 integer scores.
