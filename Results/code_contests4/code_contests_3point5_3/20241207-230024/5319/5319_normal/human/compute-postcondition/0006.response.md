`k` is updated by adding the integer value obtained from the user input. The previous state of `k` is dependent on the user input. The value of `i` is 2 and remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated based on the user input, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`k` is updated based on the user input, `i` is 2**
