According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is updated based on the user input, `i` is 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be 1.
State: **`k` is updated based on the user input, `i` is 1**
