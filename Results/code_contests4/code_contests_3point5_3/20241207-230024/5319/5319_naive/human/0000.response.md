Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program reads 10 integers from the input and calculates the total score by adding them up. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires calculating the total score of all 10 questions. The program covers all potential cases by iterating through all 10 lines of input and summing up the scores correctly. Therefore, the program is correct for all inputs and cases.
