Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input values of N, A, B, and the list of values v.
2. It then iterates through all possible combinations of items to select within the range of A to B.
3. It calculates the average value of the selected items and compares it with the current maximum average.
4. It keeps track of the maximum average value and the number of ways to achieve that maximum average.
5. Finally, it prints out the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items and the number of ways to achieve that mean.
6. The program logic follows the problem description and is able to find the correct maximum mean and the number of ways to achieve it for all given inputs.
