The function `func` reads three integers N, A, B, and a list of integers v. It then calculates the maximum average value of elements in different combinations of v with lengths ranging from A to B inclusive. Finally, it prints the maximum average value and the number of times it occurs in the combinations. However, the function does not return any specific value.
