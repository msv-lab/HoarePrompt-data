Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It takes the input values, calculates all possible combinations of items to select within the given range, finds the maximum average value, and counts the number of times this maximum average value occurs. The program outputs the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the selected items and the number of ways to select items to achieve this mean.

The program iterates through all possible combinations and correctly updates the resultValue and resultCount variables based on the conditions given in the problem description. The output format also matches the requirements specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
