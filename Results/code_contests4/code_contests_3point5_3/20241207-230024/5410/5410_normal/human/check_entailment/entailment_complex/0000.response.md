Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three integers N, A, B, and a list of integers v. It then calculates the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items by considering all combinations of items with lengths ranging from A to B inclusive. It also calculates the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized. The program outputs the correct result for all potential cases as described in the problem description.
