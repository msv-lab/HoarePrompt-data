Example Answer:
`resultCount` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N; v contains the mapped integers from the input; `resultValue` is 0, `resultCount` is 0.
Output State: **N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N; v contains the mapped integers from the input; `resultValue` is 0, `resultCount` is 0**
