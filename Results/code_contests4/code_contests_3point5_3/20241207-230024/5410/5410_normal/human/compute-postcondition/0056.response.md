Postcondition: ***N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is either the average or the maximum average value of elements in the perm list. If resultValue is less than the average, resultCount is incremented by 1, pcs is incremented by 1. If resultValue is equal to the average, resultCount is incremented by 1 and pcs is incremented by 1. If resultValue is the maximum average value, resultCount is incremented by 2 and pcs is incremented by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the perm list.***
