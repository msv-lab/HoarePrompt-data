Example Answer:
The average is calculated by summing all elements in the `cand` list and dividing by the length of the list. The variables `N`, `A`, `B`, `resultValue`, `resultCount`, and `pcs` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list. If resultValue is less than the average, resultCount is 1, pcs is incremented by 1. If resultValue is equal to the average, resultCount is incremented by 1 and pcs is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in perm list.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list. If resultValue is less than the average, resultCount is 1, pcs is incremented by 1. If resultValue is equal to the average, resultCount is incremented by 1 and pcs is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in perm list**
