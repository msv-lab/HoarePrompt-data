Example Answer: 
`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, so after execution, `resultCount` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is incremented by 1, pcs is adjusted for the last cand, cand represents the last element in perm, for the loop to execute one more time pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in cand. The resultValue is greater than or equal to average value. Additionally, resultValue is equal to the average value.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is incremented by 1, pcs is adjusted for the last cand, cand represents the last element in perm, for the loop to execute one more time pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in cand. The resultValue is greater than or equal to average value. Additionally, resultValue is equal to the average value.**
