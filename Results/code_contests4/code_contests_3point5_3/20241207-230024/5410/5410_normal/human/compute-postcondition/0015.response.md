Postcondition: ***N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, `resultValue` and `average` are the average value of elements in `cand`, `resultCount` is 1, pcs starts from 0 up to B - A, `cand` is the first element in `perm`, `perm` is not empty. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, `resultValue` is updated to the average value of elements in `cand`. If `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, `resultValue` remains the same as the average value of elements in `cand` and `resultCount` is updated to 1.***
