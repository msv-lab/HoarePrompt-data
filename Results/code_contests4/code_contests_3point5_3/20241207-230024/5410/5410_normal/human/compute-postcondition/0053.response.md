Example Answer:
`resultCount` is assigned the value 1. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is 1, pcs is incremented by 1 if resultValue is less than the average, and if resultValue is equal to the average, resultCount is incremented by 1 and pcs is incremented by 1 (if the loop condition holds).
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is 1, pcs is incremented by 1 if resultValue is less than the average, and if resultValue is equal to the average, resultCount is incremented by 1 and pcs is incremented by 1 (if the loop condition holds)**
