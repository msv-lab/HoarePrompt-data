Output State: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in cand, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list (incremented by 1 if resultValue == average), pcs is correctly adjusted for the last cand and incremented by the total number of elements in perm + 1, cand represents the last element in perm, average is the average value of elements in cand, perm is a list of all combinations of v with length B + pcs, for the loop to execute the second time perm is a list with at least 2 elements, and average is the float value of the sum of elements in the new cand divided by the length of the new cand.
