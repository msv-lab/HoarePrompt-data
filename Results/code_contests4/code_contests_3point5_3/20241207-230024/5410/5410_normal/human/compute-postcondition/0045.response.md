Example Answer:
`resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`, but the previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in the new cand, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in the new cand.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in the new cand, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in the new cand**
