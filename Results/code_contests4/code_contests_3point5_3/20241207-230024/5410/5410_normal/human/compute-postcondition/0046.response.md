`resultCount` is assigned the value 1. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in the new cand, resultCount is 1, pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in the new cand.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in the new cand, resultCount is 1, pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in the new cand**
