Example Answer:
`resultCount` is assigned the value 1. The rest of the variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, `resultValue` is now equal to `average`, `average` remains the average value of elements in the next `cand`, `resultCount` is 1, pcs is adjusted for the next `cand`, and `cand` represents the next element in `perm`.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, `resultValue` is now equal to `average`, `average` remains the average value of elements in the next `cand`, `resultCount` is 1, pcs is adjusted for the next `cand`, and `cand` represents the next element in `perm`**
