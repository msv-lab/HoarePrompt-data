Example Answer:
`resultCount` is assigned the value 1. The other variables remain the same, with N being the length of v, A being less than or equal to B, `resultValue` is the average value of elements in `cand`, `resultCount` is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, `pcs` is adjusted for the last `cand` and incremented by 1, and `resultValue` is less than average. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, `resultValue` is the average value of elements in `cand`, `resultCount` is 1, `pcs` is adjusted for the last `cand` and incremented by 1, and `resultValue` is less than average.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, `resultValue` is the average value of elements in `cand`, `resultCount` is 1, `pcs` is adjusted for the last `cand` and incremented by 1, and `resultValue` is less than average**
