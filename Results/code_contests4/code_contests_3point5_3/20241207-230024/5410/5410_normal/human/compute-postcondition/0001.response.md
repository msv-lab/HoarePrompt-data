Example Answer:
The values entered through `raw_input().split()` are mapped to integers using `map(int, ...)`, and then assigned to variable `v`. The values entered are not known, so the output state is: N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N; v contains the mapped integers from the input.
Output State: **N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N; v contains the mapped integers from the input**
