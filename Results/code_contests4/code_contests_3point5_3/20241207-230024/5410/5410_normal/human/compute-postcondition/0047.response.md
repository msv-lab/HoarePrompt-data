Example Answer: 
`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, so after execution, `resultCount` is increased by 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in the new cand.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in the new cand**
