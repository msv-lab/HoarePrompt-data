The function `func` accepts no parameters. It operates on the variables N, A, B, and v_i. The constraints for these variables are as follows: N is a positive integer between 1 and 50, A and B are positive integers between 1 and N, and v_i are integers between 1 and 10^15 for all i. The function performs some operations on these variables and does not return any specific value.

Functionality: **The function `func` operates on the variables N, A, B, and v_i according to the specified constraints but does not return any specific value.**
