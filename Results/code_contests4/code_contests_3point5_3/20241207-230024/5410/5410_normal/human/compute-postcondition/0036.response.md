Example Answer:
`resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is adjusted for the last cand, cand represents the last element in perm, for the loop to execute one more time pcs is incremented by 1, and resultValue is less than average. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in cand, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is adjusted for the last cand and incremented by 1, and resultValue is less than average.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the average value of elements in cand, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is adjusted for the last cand and incremented by 1, and resultValue is less than average**
