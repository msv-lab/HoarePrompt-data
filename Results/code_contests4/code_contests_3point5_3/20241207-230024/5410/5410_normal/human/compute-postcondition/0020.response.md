Example Answer:
`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, so after execution, `resultCount` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, `resultValue` and `average` are the average value of elements in the next `cand`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, pcs is adjusted for the next `cand`, and `cand` represents the next element in `perm`.
Output State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, `resultValue` and `average` are the average value of elements in the next `cand`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, pcs is adjusted for the next `cand`, and `cand` represents the next element in `perm`**
