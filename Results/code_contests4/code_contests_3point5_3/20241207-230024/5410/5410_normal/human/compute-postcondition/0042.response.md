Postcondition: ***N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is adjusted for the last cand, cand represents the last element in perm, for the loop to execute one more time pcs is incremented by 1, average is the average value of elements in cand. If resultValue is less than average, resultValue is updated to the average value of elements in cand, resultCount is set to 1, and pcs is adjusted for the last cand and incremented by 1. If resultValue is greater than or equal to average, resultCount is incremented by 1. In the case where resultValue is equal to the average, resultCount is also incremented by 1.***
