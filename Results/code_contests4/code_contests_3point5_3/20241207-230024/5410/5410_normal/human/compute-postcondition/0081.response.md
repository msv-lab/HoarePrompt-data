Example Answer:
`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is either the maximum average value of elements in the perm list or the average value of elements in the new cand, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list (incremented by 1 if resultValue == average), pcs is correctly adjusted for the last cand and incremented by the total number of elements in perm + 1, cand represents the new last element in perm, average is the average value of elements in the new cand, perm is a list of all combinations of v with length B + pcs, for the loop to execute the third time the perm list must have at least 3 elements, and average is the float value of the sum of elements in the new cand divided by the length of the new cand, average is assigned the float value of the sum of elements in the new cand divided by the length of new cand. If resultValue is less than average, then resultValue is updated to the average value of elements in the new cand and resultCount is set to 1. If resultValue is equal to average, then all the stated conditions remain the same, and resultCount is incremented by 1. `average` is assigned the float value of the sum of elements in the new cand divided by the length of the new cand. `resultCount` is incremented by 1.
