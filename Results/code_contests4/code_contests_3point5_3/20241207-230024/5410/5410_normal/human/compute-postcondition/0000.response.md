Example Answer:
N, A, B are assigned the values from the input after splitting them by space. The values of N, A, and B are positive integers within the given range. Therefore, the Output State is: N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N.
Output State: **N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N**
