Output State: N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list (incremented by 1 if resultValue == average), pcs is correctly adjusted for the last cand and incremented by the total number of elements in perm + 1, cand represents the last element in perm, average is the average value of elements in cand, perm is a list of all combinations of v with length B + pcs. If the loop does not execute, resultValue remains the initial value, resultCount remains the initial value, pcs is adjusted for the last cand and incremented by the total number of elements in perm + 1, and average remains the initial value.
