According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the perm list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. Also, pcs needs to be adjusted to represent the last cand for the loop to execute one more time. So, before the loop starts, N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is incremented by 1 and represents the last cand in the list.
State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is adjusted for the last cand, cand represents the last element in perm, for the loop to execute one more time pcs is incremented by 1**
