According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the perm list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, pcs is adjusted for the last cand and incremented by the total number of elements in perm + 1. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 element, pcs is correctly adjusted for the last cand and incremented by the total number of elements in perm + 1, cand represents the last element in perm, average is the average value of elements in cand, and perm is a list of all combinations of v with length B + pcs. 
State: **N is the length of v, A is less than or equal to B, resultValue is the maximum average value of elements in the perm list, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average value occurs in the perm list, pcs is correctly adjusted for the last cand and incremented by the total number of elements in perm + 1, cand represents the last element in perm, average is the average value of elements in cand, perm is a list of all combinations of v with length B + pcs, for the loop to execute the first time perm is a list with at least 1 element**
