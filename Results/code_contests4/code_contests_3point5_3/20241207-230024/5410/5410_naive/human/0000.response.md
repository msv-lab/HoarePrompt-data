Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the given problem description. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
```

The expected output should be:
```
4.500000
1
```

However, the program does not output the correct result for this input. The program calculates the average for all possible combinations of items within the range of A to B. This approach is incorrect as it does not guarantee that the selected items will be the maximum possible arithmetic mean. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
