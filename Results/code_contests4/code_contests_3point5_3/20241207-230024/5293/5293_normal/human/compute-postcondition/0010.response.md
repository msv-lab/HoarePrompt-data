Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state is unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: if `at_start` is True, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `at_start` is False.
Output State: **if `at_start` is True, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `at_start` is False**
