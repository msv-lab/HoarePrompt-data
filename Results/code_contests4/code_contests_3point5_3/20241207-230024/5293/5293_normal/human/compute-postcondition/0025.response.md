Functionality: **The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to a file specified in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` by default. It handles the `sep`, `end`, and `flush` keyword arguments in the `kwargs` dictionary. If `flush` is True, it flushes the file. However, the annotations mention the removal of `sep` and `end` from `kwargs` but do not show the actual code for this action. Thus, the functionality does not align with the annotations in handling these cases.**
