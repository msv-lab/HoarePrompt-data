Example Answer:
The value of `at_start` is set to False. Since `at_start` was previously True, the value has changed. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: If `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`.
Output State: **If `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`**
