According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. If the `args` iterable has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `args` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element in `args`.
State: **if `at_start` is True, `args` is an iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, and `at_start` is False**
