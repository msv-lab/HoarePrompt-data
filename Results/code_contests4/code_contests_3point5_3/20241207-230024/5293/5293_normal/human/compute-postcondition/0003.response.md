According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is an iterable with at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `at_start` is True at the beginning, it does not have a direct impact on the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `args` must have at least 1 element and `x` is the first element in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`.**
