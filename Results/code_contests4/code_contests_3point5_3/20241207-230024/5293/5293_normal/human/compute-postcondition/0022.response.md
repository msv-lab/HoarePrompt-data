Output State: **If `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least one element where `x` is the last element in `args`, `at_start` remains False, and `flush` is popped from `kwargs`. If `at_start` is True, `args` is an empty iterable, `at_start` remains True, and `flush` is popped from `kwargs`.**
