Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are assigned by popping the values from the `kwargs` dictionary. If no values are provided, `sep` is assigned ' ' and `file` is assigned `sys.stdout`. The initial state mentions that the program prints values to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default. Therefore, the Output State is: The program prints values to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default, `sep` is ' ' and `file` is `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **The program prints values to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default, `sep` is ' ' and `file` is `sys.stdout`**
