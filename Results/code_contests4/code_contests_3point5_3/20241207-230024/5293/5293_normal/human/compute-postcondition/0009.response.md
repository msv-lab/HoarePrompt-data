According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `args`. If `args` has more elements to iterate, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, if `at_start` was True, `args` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `at_start` is False. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there should be at least one more element in `args` to iterate.
State: **if `at_start` is True, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `at_start` is False**
