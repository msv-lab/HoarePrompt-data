Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to a file. The variable `at_start` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: if `at_start` is True, `args` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `at_start` is False. Otherwise, the program remains in the same state as the precondition.
Output State: **if `at_start` is True, `args` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `at_start` is False. Otherwise, the program remains in the same state as the precondition.**
