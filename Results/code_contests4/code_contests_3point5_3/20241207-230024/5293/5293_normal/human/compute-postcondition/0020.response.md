Example Answer:
The 'end' key is popped from the `kwargs` dictionary and written to the file. The value of 'end' may vary depending on the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least one element, `x` is the last element in `args` and `at_start` is False. Otherwise, if `at_start` is True, `args` is an empty iterable and `at_start` is True.
Output State: **If `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least one element, `x` is the last element in `args` and `at_start` is False. Otherwise, if `at_start` is True, `args` is an empty iterable and `at_start` is True.**
