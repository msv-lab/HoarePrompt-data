The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from input, then iterates `t` times. Within each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It then calls another function `func_2` with the count of the most common element in list `a`. The function does not accept any parameters, and its purpose is to handle user input for `n` and `a`, and pass relevant information to `func_2`.
