Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The `func_2` function is incomplete and does not perform the required logic to determine the minimum number of colors Nezzar can use. The program lacks the necessary implementation to determine the minimum number of colors based on the given sequence of numbers on the balls. Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description.

In order to solve the problem correctly, the program needs to implement the logic to determine the minimum number of colors required by Nezzar based on the given sequence of numbers. This logic is missing in the provided program.
