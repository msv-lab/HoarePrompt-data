Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. The `func_2` function does not handle the cases mentioned in the annotations related to `sep` and `end` keyword arguments in the `kwargs` dictionary. The annotations mention the removal of `sep` and `end` from `kwargs` but do not show the actual code for this action. As a result, the program is incorrect as it does not fully align with the problem description and annotations.
