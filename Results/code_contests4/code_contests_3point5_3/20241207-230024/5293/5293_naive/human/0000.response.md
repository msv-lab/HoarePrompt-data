Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly, iterates through each test case, calculates the minimum number of colors Nezzar can use based on the most common element in the list, and prints the result for each test case. The logic seems to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, the program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) effectively. Therefore, based on the provided information and logic, the program is correct for all potential cases.
