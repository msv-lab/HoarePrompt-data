Example Answer:
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the value of `sep`. The value of `sep` is assigned as the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`. If `sep` is not provided in `kwargs`, then `sep` is `b' '`. Therefore, `file.write(sep)` will write a space character to the file. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least one more element**
