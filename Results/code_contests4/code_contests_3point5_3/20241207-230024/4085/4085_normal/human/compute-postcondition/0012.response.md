Example Answer:
The value of `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. Since the variable `at_start` was already `False`, there is no change in its value. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is not empty.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is not empty**
