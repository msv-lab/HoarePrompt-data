Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It assigns values to `sep` and `file` based on the provided key-value pairs in `kwargs`. It then iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to the `file` separated by the specified separator `sep`. After the loop, it writes the value of the 'end' key in `kwargs` to the `file`. If the 'flush' key exists in `kwargs` and is set to True, it flushes the `file`. The function does not return any value.**
