According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is not empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `args` must still not be empty.
State: **`sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is not empty**
