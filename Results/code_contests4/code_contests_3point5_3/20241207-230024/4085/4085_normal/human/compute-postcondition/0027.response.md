The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is a standalone function that does not take any input. After executing the function body, it returns some output based on the constraints mentioned for the parameters N and A_i. Since the function does not have any parameters, it is expected to utilize the constraints directly within the function body to process some data and return a specific output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to perform some operations based on the constraints provided for the parameters N and A_i, and return a specific output without accepting any parameters.
