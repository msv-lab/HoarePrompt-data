Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10^5, `gcd_arr` is a list of size N+1 with `gcd_arr[1]` being the GCD of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is N-1, `gcd_arr_rev` is a list of size N+1 with updated values based on the given calculation from the loop, `res` is the maximum value between the calculated GCDs in each iteration of the loop**
