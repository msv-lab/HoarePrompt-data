Example Answer: 
The `write` method of the `file` object is called with the value stored in `sep`. The value of `sep` is either the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`. Therefore, the `write` method will write the value of `sep` to the file. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is not empty**
