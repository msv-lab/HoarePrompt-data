According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop will execute. 

For the loop to execute:
- `args` should not be empty
- `sep` should be assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`
- `file` should be assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`
- `at_start` should be True

State: **`sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute `args` is not empty**
