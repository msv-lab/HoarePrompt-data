Example Answer:
The code snippet `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` is unpacking values from a dictionary `kwargs`. If the dictionary `kwargs` contains a key `'sep'`, then the value corresponding to that key is assigned to `sep`, otherwise `b' '` is assigned to `sep`. Similarly, if the dictionary `kwargs` contains a key `'file'`, then the value corresponding to that key is assigned to `file`, otherwise `sys.stdout` is assigned to `file`. The variables `sep` and `file` are affected by this code snippet, while other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`**
