Example Answer:
The value of `at_start` is assigned False. Since there are no changes in the variables after the execution of the if else block, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value of the key 'sep' in `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is assigned the value of the key 'file' in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element, and there is no change in the variables after the execution of the if else block.**
