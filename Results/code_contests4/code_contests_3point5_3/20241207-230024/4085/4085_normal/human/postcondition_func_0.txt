The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `A` of size `N`. It then calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of elements in the list `A` in two directions, forwards and backwards. After computing the GCDs, it finds the maximum GCD between the two calculated arrays and passes this result to `func_2` as a parameter. The function does not accept any explicit parameters but relies on the user to input `N` and `A` during execution.
