Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes an integer input, sorts the list of integers, calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the prefix and suffix arrays, and then finds the maximum GCD from the two arrays. This logic seems to correctly find the maximum possible GCD of the N integers on the blackboard after making a move. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
