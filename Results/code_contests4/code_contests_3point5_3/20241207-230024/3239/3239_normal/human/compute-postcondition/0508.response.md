Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `j` was increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `j` at the time of appending is the incremented value. The list `l` now contains the updated value of `j`. 
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
