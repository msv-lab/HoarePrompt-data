Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the loop can continue for one more iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, `i`, `f`, and `g` remain the same. After execution, the list `l` will now contain the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, `l` contains the appended value of `j`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, `l` contains the appended value of `j`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration**
