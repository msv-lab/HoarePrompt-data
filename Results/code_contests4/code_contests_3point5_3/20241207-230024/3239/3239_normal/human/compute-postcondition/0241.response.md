Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated. If `f[6]` is true, `l` appends the value at index 6 of list `g`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If `f[6]` is false, `l` appends the updated value of `j` and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
