Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is a list containing the element at index 8 of list `g`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements with the 8th element incremented by 1, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the execution path, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. `a[i]` is not even. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 17. Additionally, the element at index `i` of list `a` is divisible by 19. If the condition at index 8 of list `f` is true, the program retains its previous state. If the condition at index 8 of list `f` is false, `l` is a list containing 1, `g[8]` is 1.**
