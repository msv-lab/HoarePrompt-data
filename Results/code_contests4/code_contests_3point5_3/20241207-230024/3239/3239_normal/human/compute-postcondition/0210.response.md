Example Answer:
`g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so the final value of `g[1]` depends on the value of `j` at runtime. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` appends the updated value of `j` after increment.
Output State: **`l` appends the updated value of `j` after increment**
