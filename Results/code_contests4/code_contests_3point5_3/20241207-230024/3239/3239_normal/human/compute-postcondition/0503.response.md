Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the index 2 of list `g`. The value of `j` has been increased by 1 in the initial state, so the value assigned to index 2 of list `g` is the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, and `g[2]` is the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, `g[2]` is the updated value of `j`**
