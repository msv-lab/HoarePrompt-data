Postcondition: ***`l`, `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `n` are all variables with specific conditions. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `l` contains the value at index 3 of list `g`. If `f[3]` is True, all other variables remain unchanged. If `f[3]` is False, `l` contains 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, `f` is a list with 12 zeros, `g` is a list with 12 zeros where `g[3]` is 1, `j` is assigned the value 1, `n` is greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 5. The element at index 3 in `f` is 1. If `a[i] % 5 != 0`, then based on the conditions in the else part, the variables `l`, `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `n` are updated accordingly based on the divisibility of `a[i]` by 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29, and 31.***
