Example Answer:
`g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is unknown, so the new value of `j` is unknown as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g[1]` is unknown.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g[1]` is unknown**
