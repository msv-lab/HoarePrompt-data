Example Answer:
`l` is updated by appending the element at index 6 of list `g`. The values of `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code for the next iteration; `l` has been updated by appending the element at index 6 of list `g`.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code for the next iteration; `l` has been updated by appending the element at index 6 of list `g`**
