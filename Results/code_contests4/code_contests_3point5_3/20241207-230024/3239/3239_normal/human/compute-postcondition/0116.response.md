Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is a list containing the value of either `g[11]` or `j` based on the condition, `f` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. `a[i]` is not even, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, but divisible by 31. If `f[11]` is true, then the list `l` contains the value of `g[11]`, otherwise, `l` contains the value of `j`. `f[11]` is incremented by 1.**
