Example Answer:
The value of `j` is increased by 1, and then `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` is increased by 1 and added to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`**
