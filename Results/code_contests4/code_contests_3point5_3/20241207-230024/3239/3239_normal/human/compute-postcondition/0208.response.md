Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` will be increased by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration, `j` is incremented by 1**
