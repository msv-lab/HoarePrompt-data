Example Answer:
`g[2]` is assigned the value of `j` that was appended. The value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: list `l` contains the value of `j` that was appended, `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.
Output State: **list `l` contains the value of `j` that was appended, `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`**
