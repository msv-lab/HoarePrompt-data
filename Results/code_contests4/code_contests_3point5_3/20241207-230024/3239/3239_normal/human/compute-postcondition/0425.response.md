Example Answer:
`g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` has been increased by 1. The elements of list `l` contain the values of `j`, so `g[2]` will now have the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1; elements of list `l` contain the updated values of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1; elements of list `l` contain the updated values of `j`**
