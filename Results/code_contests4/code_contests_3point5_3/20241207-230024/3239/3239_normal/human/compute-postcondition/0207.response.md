Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The previous values of `l` and `g` are unknown, so the output state is: After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. `l` has appended the value at index 1 of `g`.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. `l` has appended the value at index 1 of `g`**
