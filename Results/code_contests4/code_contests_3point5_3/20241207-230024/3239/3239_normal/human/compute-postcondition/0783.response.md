Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`, so the list `l` now contains the incremented value of `j`. The values of `a`, `f`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
