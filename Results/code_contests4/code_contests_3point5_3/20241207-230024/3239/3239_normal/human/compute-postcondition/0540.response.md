Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` are variables that will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code for the next iteration. If the condition `f[8]` is true, then the values of `a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` will be updated as per the code. If the condition `f[8]` is false, then `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, and `g[8]` is equal to the new value of `j`.***
