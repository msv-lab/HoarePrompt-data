Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are all variables. If `f[8]` is True, then `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged, and `l` has the element at index 8 of list `g` appended. If `f[8]` is False, then `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` are all incremented by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
