Postcondition: ***`l`, `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `n` are all variables with specific conditions. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `l` contains the value of the fifth element of list `g` if the fifth element of list `f` is true, which is 0. Otherwise, `l` contains the value 1 and `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7 but divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is incremented by 1, `g[5]` is assigned the value 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `l` contains 1, `j` is 1, and the element at index 6 in list `g` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `l` contains the element at index 8 of list `g`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `l` contains the value of `g[10]`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, `l` contains 1 and `j` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is False, `g[11]` is 1, and `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
