Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state mentions that `j` is increased by 1, after appending it to the list `l`, the new value of `j` will be the previous value of `j` plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1; elements of list `l` contain the values of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1; elements of list `l` contain the values of `j`**
