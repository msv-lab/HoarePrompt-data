Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition. If `f[8]` is True, `l` appends the value at index 8 of list `g`. If `f[8]` is False, `l` contains the appended value of `j`. The loop can continue for one more iteration.***
