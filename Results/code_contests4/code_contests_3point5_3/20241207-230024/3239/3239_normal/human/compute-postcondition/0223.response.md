Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If the condition `f[3]` is true, then `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If the condition `f[3]` is false, then `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration, and `l` contains the appended value of `j`.***
