Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing the value at index 9 of list `g`, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 23. Additionally, the value at index 9 in list `f` is considered as True if `f[9]` is True. If `f[9]` is False, `l` is a list containing 1, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 23. `f[9]` is False, `g[9]` is 1***
