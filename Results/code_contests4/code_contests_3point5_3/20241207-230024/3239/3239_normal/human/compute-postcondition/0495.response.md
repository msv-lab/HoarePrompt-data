Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` will be increased by 1. Since no other variables are affected, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, `l` remain unchanged; `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, `l` remain unchanged; `j` is increased by 1**
