Postcondition: ***`l`, `f`, `g` are lists. If `a[i]` % 29 == 0, `l`, `f`, `g` lists may have been updated based on the condition of `f[10]`. `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to list `l`. If `a[i]` % 31 == 0 and `f[11]` is true, then `l`, `f`, `g` have been modified. If `a[i]` % 31 == 0 and `f[11]` is false, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
