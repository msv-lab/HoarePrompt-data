Example Answer: 
`g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`**
