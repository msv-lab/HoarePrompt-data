Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to list `l`. Since the initial state mentions that `j` is increased by 1, after appending `j` to `l`, the value of `j` in the list will be the incremented value. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
