Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code for the next iteration. If `f[4]` is True, `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` has the value that was at index 4 of list `g` appended to it. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, elements of list `l` now contain the new value of `j` at index 4.***
