Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the value stored in the 3rd index of list `g`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the 3rd index of list `g` is updated with the incremented value of `j`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of other variables, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `g` now has the updated value at index 3.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `g` now has the updated value at index 3**
