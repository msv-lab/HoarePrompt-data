Example Answer:
The code `l.append(g[2])` appends the third element of list `g` to list `l`. Since the initial state of `l` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact output state. However, after the execution of this code, the third element of list `g` will be added to list `l`.
Output State: **the third element of list `g` is appended to list `l`**
