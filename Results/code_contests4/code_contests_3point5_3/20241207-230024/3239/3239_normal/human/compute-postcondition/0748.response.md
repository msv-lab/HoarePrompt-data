Example Answer:
`j` is increased by 1, and the new value of `j` is added to the list `l`. The value of `j` after increment is 2, so `g[8]` is assigned the value 2. Therefore, the Output State is: lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged, `j` is 2, and the value 2 is added to the list `l`.
Output State: **lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged, `j` is 2, and the value 2 is added to the list `l`**
