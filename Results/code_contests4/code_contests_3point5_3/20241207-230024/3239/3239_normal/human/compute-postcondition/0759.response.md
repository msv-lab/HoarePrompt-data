Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 and then appended to the list `l`. The previous values of the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: values in the list `l`, `f`, `g` are unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`**
