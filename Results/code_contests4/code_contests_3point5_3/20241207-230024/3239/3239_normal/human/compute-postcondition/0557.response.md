Example Answer: 
`g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the new value of `j` is 1 more than the previous value. Therefore, `g[11]` contains the new value of `j`, which is 1 more than the previous value of `j`.
Output State: **`g[11]` contains the new value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1**
