Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, so the list `l` grows by one element which is the value of `j`. The other variables `a`, `f`, `g`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are all updated values based on the next iteration of the loop; `l` contains the appended value of `j`.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are all updated values based on the next iteration of the loop; `l` contains the appended value of `j`**
