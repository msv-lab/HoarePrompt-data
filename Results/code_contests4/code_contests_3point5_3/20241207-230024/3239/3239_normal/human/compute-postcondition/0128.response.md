According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 can be assigned the value of `j`, `j` may be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 can be assigned the value of `j`, `j` may be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
