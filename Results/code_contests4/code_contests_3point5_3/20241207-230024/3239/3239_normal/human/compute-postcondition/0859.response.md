Example Answer:
The function `func_8` is called with the argument `max(l)`, which will return the maximum value in the list `l`. The function will then perform certain calculations based on the maximum value of `l`. The variables `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` will be affected based on the conditions met during the function execution. The specific values and states of the variables cannot be determined without knowing the exact implementation of `func_8` and the contents of list `l`.

Output State: **The specific output state cannot be determined without further information about the function `func_8` and the contents of list `l`.**
