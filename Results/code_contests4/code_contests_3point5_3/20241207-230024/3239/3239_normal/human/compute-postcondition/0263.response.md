Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, so the list `l` will have an additional element which is the value of `j`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, `l` has an additional element which is the value of `j`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, `l` has an additional element which is the value of `j`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration**
