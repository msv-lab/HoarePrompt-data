Example Answer:
The value of `j` is added to the list `l` using the `append` method. Since `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, the new value of `j` will be added to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged, `j` is increased by 1 and the new value of `j` is added to the list `l`.
Output State: **lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged, `j` is increased by 1 and the new value of `j` is added to the list `l`**
