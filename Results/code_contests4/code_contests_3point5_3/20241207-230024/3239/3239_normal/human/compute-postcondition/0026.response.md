Output State: **After the if-else block executes, `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is a list containing either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is incremented by 1, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 can be assigned the value of `j`, `j` may be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not even, and the element at index `i` of list `a` is divisible by 3. The final state of the program variables depends on the evaluation of the condition `f[2]` which will determine the exact values assigned to `l` and `g` after the execution of the if-else block.**
