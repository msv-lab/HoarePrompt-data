Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are variables with specific initial values and relationships. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, then the value at index 8 of list `f` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, then the value at index 9 of list `f` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `l` is appended with the element at index 10 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `l` is modified based on the described conditions, `f[11]` is incremented by 1, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j+1`. If none of the conditions are met, then `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j` appended with the incremented value of `j`, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[10]` is incremented by 1.***
