Example Answer:
`g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous values of `j`, `f`, and `g` are not provided, so the output state is: `l` contains the updated values of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.
Output State: **`l` contains the updated values of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`**
