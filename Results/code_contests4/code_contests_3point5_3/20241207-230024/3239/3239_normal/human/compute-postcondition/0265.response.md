Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated accordingly. If `f[10]` is true, then `l` appends the element at index 10 of list `g`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If `f[10]` is false, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, `l` has an additional element which is the value of `j`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.***
