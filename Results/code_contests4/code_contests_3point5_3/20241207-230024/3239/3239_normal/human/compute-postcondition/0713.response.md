Postcondition: ***`l`, `f`, `g` are lists. If `f[2]` is True, adjust the values in `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, and append `g[2]` to `l`. Increment `i` by 1 if the loop can execute one more time. If `f[2]` is False, list `l` contains the value of `j` that was appended, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
