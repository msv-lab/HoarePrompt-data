Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is assigned to the 5th index of list `g`. As `j` was incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `j` is now increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and the 5th index of list `g` now holds the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, the 5th index of list `g` now holds the updated value of `j`**
