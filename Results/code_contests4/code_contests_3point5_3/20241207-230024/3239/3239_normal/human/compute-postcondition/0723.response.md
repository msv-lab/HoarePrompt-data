Example Answer:
The element `j` is appended to the list `l`. The values in the lists `f` and `g` remain the same based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain the same based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and element `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain the same based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and element `j` is appended to the list `l`**
