Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the result of calling the function `func_1()`. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that the result of `func_1()` must be greater than zero. The specific value returned by `func_1()` is unknown, so the output state is: The function `func_8` is called with the maximum value in list `l`, and the result of `func_1()` is unknown.
Output State: **The function `func_8` is called with the maximum value in list `l`, and the result of `func_1()` is unknown**
