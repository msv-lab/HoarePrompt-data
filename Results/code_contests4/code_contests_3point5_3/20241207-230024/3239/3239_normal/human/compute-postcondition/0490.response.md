Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` are lists and integers. Adjustments have been made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[i] % 5 == 0` and `f[3]` is True, no changes are made. If `a[i] % 5 == 0` and `f[3]` is False, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and `g[3]` is updated with the new value of `j`. If `a[i] % 5 != 0` and the mentioned conditions in the else part do not apply, `j` maintains its previous value, `l` remains unchanged, and no changes are made to `g`.***
