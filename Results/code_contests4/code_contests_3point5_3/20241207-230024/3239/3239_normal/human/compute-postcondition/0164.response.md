Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j` appended with the value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is either incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the second time, `i` is 1, `l` appends the value of `g` at index 6 if the condition is true. Otherwise, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j` appended with the value of `j`, based on the else part condition. The element at index 6 of list `f` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged.**
