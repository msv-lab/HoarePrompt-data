Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is the 11th element of list `g`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. `a[i]` is not even. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 19. `a[i]` is not divisible by 23. After the if condition, `a[i]` is divisible by 29. If `f[10]` is true, `l` is the 11th element of list `g`. Otherwise, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
