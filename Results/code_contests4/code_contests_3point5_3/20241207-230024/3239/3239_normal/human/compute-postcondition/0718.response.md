Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is stored in the 4th index of list `g`. As `j` was incremented by 1 in the initial state, the new value of `j` is used. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g` now has the new value of `j` at index 3.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g` now has the new value of `j` at index 3**
