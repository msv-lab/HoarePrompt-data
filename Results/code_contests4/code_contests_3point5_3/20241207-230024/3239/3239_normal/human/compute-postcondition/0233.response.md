Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. After execution, the list `l` will have the updated values. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration; `l` has been appended with the value of `j`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration; `l` has been appended with the value of `j`**
