Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the 9th index of list `g`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, so the value stored in index 9 of list `g` will be `j + 1`. The updated value of `j` is stored in variable `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, variable `l` contains the updated value of `j`, list `g` has the value of `j + 1` at index 9.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, variable `l` contains the updated value of `j`, list `g` has the value of `j + 1` at index 9**
