Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are variables with specific initial values and relationships. The postcondition includes conditions based on the value of `a[i]` and the subsequent modifications to `l`, `f`, and `g` based on those values. The postcondition details the various scenarios such as `a[i] % 3 == 0`, `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `a[i] % 31 == 0`, and the default case where none of these conditions are met. The postcondition provides a clear summary of the state of the program variables after the completion of the if else block.***
