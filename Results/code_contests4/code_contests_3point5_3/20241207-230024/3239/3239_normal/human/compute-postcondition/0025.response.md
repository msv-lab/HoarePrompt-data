Functionality: ** The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to the output stream specified by `file`. It separates the elements by the value of `sep`, which defaults to a space. It then writes the value of `end` to the output stream, which defaults to a newline character. If the keyword argument `flush` is present, it flushes the stream. The function does not have a return value.**
