Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j+1`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j+1`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration**
