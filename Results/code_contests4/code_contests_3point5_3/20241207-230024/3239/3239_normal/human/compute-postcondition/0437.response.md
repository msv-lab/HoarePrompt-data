Example Answer:
`g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, which has been increased by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `j` is increased by 1, the new value of `j` is 1 more than the previous value. Therefore, the value of `g[4]` would be the new value of `j`. The list `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g[4]` is the new value of `j`**
