Postcondition: ***`l`, `f`, `g`, `a`, `i`, and `j` are lists and integers. If `f[4]` is true, the value at index 4 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `f[4]` is false, the values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain the same based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and element `j` is appended to the list `l`.***
