Example Answer: 
`g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. Therefore, after execution, `g[4]` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 1, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list of 12 elements with element at index 4 set to 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 7. The element at index 4 in list `f` is 0**
