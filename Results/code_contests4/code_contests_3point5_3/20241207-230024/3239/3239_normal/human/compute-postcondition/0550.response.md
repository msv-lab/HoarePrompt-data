Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, then it is appended to the list `l`. The previous values of `a`, `f`, `g`, `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, `l` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 and added to the list `l`.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, `l` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 and added to the list `l`**
