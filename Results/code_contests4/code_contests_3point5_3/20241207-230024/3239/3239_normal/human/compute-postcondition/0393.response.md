Output State: **`l` contains the value of `g[10]` which is 0 if `f[10]` is true, otherwise `l` contains 1. `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, a list `f` is created with 12 zeros, `g` is a list with 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1. `n` is greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, except for being divisible by 29. Additionally, the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 29. If `f[10]` is true, then the element at index 10 in `f` is True, otherwise it's False. If `f[10]` is true, `g[10]` is 0. If `f[10]` is false, `g[10]` is 1.**
