Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` are variables that will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `a`, `f`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and this new value of `j` is added to the list `l`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` in the else part, `a`, `f`, and `j` are updated accordingly. If `f[11]` is True, `l` appends the value at index 11 of list `g`. Otherwise, `g[11]` contains the new value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1.***
