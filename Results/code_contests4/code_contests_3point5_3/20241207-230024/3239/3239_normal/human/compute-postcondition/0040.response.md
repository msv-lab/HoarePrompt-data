Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is a list containing the element at index 4 of list `g`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. `a[i]` is not even. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 5. Additionally, the element at index `i` of list `a` is divisible by 7. The element at index 4 of list `f` is true**
