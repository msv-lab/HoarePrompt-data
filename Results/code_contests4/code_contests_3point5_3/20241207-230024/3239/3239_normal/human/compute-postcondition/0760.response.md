Example Answer: 
`j` is incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`, so the value of `j` becomes the new element in the list `l`. Since `j` is now in the 11th position of the list `g`, the value of the list `g` at index 10 is updated to the new value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`, and the value of `g` at index 10 is updated to the new value of `j`.
Output State: **values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`, and the value of `g` at index 10 is updated to the new value of `j`**
