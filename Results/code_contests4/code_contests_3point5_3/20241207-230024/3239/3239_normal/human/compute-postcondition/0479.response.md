Example Answer:
`g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `l` contains the value `j` at the end, after execution, `g[11]` will also contain the value `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` contains the value `j` at the end, `g[11]` contains the value `j`.
Output State: **`l` contains the value `j` at the end, `g[11]` contains the value `j`**
