Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing the value at index 8 of list `g` if a[i] % 19 == 0. If `f[8]` is true, `l` will be a list containing the value at index 8 of list `g`. If `f[8]` is false, `l` will be a list containing 1. `j` will be 1 if `f[8]` is false. `f` will remain the same as initialized with the 9th element incremented by 1 if a[i] % 19 == 0. `g[8]` will be 1 if a[i] % 19 == 0. 

If a[i] % 19 != 0, `l` is a list containing the value at index 9 of list `g` if a[i] % 23 == 0. If a[i] % 29 == 0, the 10th element of `f` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 based on the condition of `f[10]`. The 10th element of `g` is always 1. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. If a[i] % 29 != 0, `l` is a list with one element. The 11th element of `f` is incremented by 1. The 11th element of `g` is set to 1. `j` is 1. Additionally, if a[i] % 31 == 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 31.***
