Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, after execution, `j` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain updated as per the postcondition of the if else block. The loop can continue for one more iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.**
