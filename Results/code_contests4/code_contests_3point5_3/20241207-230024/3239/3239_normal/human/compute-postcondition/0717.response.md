Example Answer:
A value is appended to the list `l`, and that value is the current value of `j`, which has been incremented by 1. The states of the other lists (`f`, `g`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`**
