Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, the function returns None. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `f[3]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `f[4]` is True, `l` has the value of the element at index 4 of list `g`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If `a[i] % 7 != 0`, `f[5]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[6]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `f[7]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `f[8]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[9]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[10]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[11]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 31. Based on the value of `f[5]`, `l` either appends the element at index 5 of list `g` or the value of `j`. The loop can continue for one more iteration in either case.***
