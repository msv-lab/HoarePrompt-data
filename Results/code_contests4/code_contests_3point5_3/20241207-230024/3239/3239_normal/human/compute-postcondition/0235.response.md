Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If f[5] is True, `l` appends the element at index 5 of list `g`. If f[5] is False, `l` has been appended with the value of `j`.***
