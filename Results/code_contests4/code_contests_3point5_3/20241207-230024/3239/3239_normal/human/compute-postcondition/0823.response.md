Example Answer:
`l` is appended with the element at index 8 of list `g`. The values of `a`, `f`, `j`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged, `l` has the element at index 8 of list `g` appended.
Output State: **`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged, `l` has the element at index 8 of list `g` appended**
