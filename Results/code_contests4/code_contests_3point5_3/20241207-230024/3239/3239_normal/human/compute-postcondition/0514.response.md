Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state mentions `j` is increased by 1, the value of `j` after incrementing by 1 is appended to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, elements of list `l` now contain the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, elements of list `l` now contain the new value of `j`**
