Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `f` and `g` are lists of 12 elements each. If a[i] % 13 == 0, `l` is a list with one element which is the value at index 6 of list g, f is a list of 12 elements where the 6th element is 2 and the rest are 0, g is a list of 12 elements where the 6th element is 1 and the rest are 0, j is 1, i is 0, n is greater than 0. The element at index i in list a is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. The element at index i in list a is divisible by 13 and the element at index 6 in list f is not True. If a[i] % 17 == 0 and f[7] was True, f[7] becomes 2. If f[7] was False, f[7] becomes 1. If a[i] % 19 == 0, `l` contains the value at index 8 of `g`, `f[8]` is incremented by 1 if true, `g[8]` is set to 1. If a[i] % 19 != 0 and a[i] % 23 == 0, `l` contains the value at index 9 of `g`, `f[10]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 based on the condition, `g[10]` is always 1. If a[i] % 29 != 0, `l` contains one element, `f[11]` is incremented by 1, `g[11]` is set to 1. If a[i] % 31 == 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 31. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the conditions mentioned.***
