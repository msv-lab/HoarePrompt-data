Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` contains the appended element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 can be assigned the value of `j`, `j` may be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. After the execution of the if else block, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j` appended with the new value of `j`, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is either incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `f` now has the element at index 2 incremented by 1.**
