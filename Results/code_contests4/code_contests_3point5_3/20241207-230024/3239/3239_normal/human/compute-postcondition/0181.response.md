Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are all variables with specific values and relationships based on the conditions in the if-else block. If the condition in the if part is true, `l` appends the element at index 9 of list `g`. If the condition in the else part is true, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j` appended with the incremented value of `j`.***
