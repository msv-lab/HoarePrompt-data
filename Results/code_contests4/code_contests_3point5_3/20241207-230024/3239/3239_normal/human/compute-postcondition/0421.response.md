Example Answer:
The value of `f[1]` is incremented by 1. Since `f[1]` is not directly assigned a value in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After the increment, `f[1]` becomes 1. Based on the condition, since `f[1]` is not true, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 1, `l` now contains the updated value of `j` which is [1], and `g` contains the updated value of `j` at index 1 which is [0, 1].
Output State: **`f[1]` is 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `g` is [0, 1]**
