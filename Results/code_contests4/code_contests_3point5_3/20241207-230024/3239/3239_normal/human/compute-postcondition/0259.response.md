Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated based on the execution of the if else block. If `f[9]` is true, `l` appends the element at index 9 of list `g`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If `f[9]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` appends the new value of `j`, `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.***
