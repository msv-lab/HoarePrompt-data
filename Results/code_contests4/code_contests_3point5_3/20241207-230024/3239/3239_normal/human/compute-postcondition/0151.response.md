Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `j`, `i` are integers. `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged. `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 can be assigned the value of `j`. If `f[4]`, `l` appends the value at index 4 of list `g`. If not `f[4]`, `l` appends the value of `j` and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
