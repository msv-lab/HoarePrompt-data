Postcondition: ***`l`, `f`, `g` are lists, `a` is a list. If `f[9]` is True, adjust the values in list `l` based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, `f` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, and increment `i` by 1 if the loop can execute one more time. If `f[9]` is False, increment `j` by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and `g[9]` now holds the updated value of `j`.***
