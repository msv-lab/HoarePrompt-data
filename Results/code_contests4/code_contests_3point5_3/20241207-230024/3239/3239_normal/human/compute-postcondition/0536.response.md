Example Answer:
The code appends the value at index 8 of list `g` to the list `l`. The contents of `l` and `g` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values being appended. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code for the next iteration.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code for the next iteration**
