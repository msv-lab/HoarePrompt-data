Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. If `f[3]` is true, then the value at index 3 of list `g` is appended to list `l`, otherwise `a`, `l`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged. If the else part is executed, `j` is increased by 1 and appended to list `l`, and the value at index 3 of list `g` is updated with the new value of `j`.***
