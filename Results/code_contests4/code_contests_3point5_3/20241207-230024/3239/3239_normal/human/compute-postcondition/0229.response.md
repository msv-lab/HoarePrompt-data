Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition. If `f[4]` is True, `l` has the value of the element at index 4 of list `g`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If `f[4]` is False, `n`, `a`, `j` are updated as per the postcondition, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. The loop can continue for one more iteration in either case.***
