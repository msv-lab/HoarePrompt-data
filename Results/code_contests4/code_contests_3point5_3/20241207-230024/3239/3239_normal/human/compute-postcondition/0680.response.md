Output State: **`l` is a list containing the value of `g[10] which is 0 if f[10] is true. If f[10] is false, `l` is a list containing 1. `f` is a list of 12 elements where the element at index 10 has been incremented by 1, `g` is a list of 12 elements where the element at index 10 is always 1, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 but is divisible by 29. The element at index 10 in list `f` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition.**
