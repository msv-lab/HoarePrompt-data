Example Answer:
`g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` has been previously incremented by 1. The list `l` is appended with the incremented value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1; `l` is appended with the incremented value of `j`; `g[9]` is assigned the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1; `l` is appended with the incremented value of `j`; `g[9]` is assigned the incremented value of `j`**
