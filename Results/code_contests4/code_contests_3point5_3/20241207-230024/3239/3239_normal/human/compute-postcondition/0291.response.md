Example Answer:
A list `f` is created with 12 zeros. The list `l` remains empty and `a` is still assigned the return value of `func_4`. Therefore, the Output State is: The list `l` is empty, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, a list `f` is created with 12 zeros.
Output State: **The list `l` is empty, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, a list `f` is created with 12 zeros**
