Example Answer:
The value at index 9 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The previous values of variables `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` contains the value at index 9 of list `g`.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` contains the value at index 9 of list `g`**
