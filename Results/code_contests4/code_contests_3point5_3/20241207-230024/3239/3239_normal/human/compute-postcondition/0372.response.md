Postcondition: ***`l` is a list. If `f[8]` is true, then `l` contains the element at index 8 of list `g`. If `f[8]` is not true, then `l` contains the value 1. `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`. Both `f` and `g` are lists with 12 zeros where the 8th element of `f` is not true. `j` is assigned the value 1. The loop executes with `n` greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, but is divisible by 19.***
