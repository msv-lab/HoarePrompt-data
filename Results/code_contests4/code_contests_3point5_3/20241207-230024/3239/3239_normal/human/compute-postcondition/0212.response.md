Example Answer:
`f[1]` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `f[1]` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. If `f[1]` is true, `l` has appended the value at index 1 of `g`. If `f[1]` is false, `l` appends the updated value of `j` after increment.
