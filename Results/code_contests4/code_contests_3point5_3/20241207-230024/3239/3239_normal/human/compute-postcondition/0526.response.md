Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state mentions that variable `j` is increased by 1, the value of `j` would be the increased value after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, and the list `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
