Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain the same based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain the same based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
