Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then if `f[10]` is True, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged, and `l` appends the element at index 10 of list `g`. If `f[10]` is False, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are all incremented by 1; `l` appends `j`; `g` has a new value at index 10 which is equal to the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 29 != 0`, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is checked. If `f[11]` is True, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged, and the element at index 11 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `f[11]` is False, `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are updated based on the next loop iteration. `l` contains the appended value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
