Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` will have been increased by 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j` is updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j` is updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.**
