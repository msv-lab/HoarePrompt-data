Example Answer:
`g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is the last element in the list `l`. The variables `a`, `f`, `g`, `i` are incremented by 1, so their values change. The output state is: `a`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
