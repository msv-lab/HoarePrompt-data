Example Answer:
The value of `j` is increased by 1, and then the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the updated values of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the updated values of `j`**
