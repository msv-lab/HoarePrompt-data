Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. After the execution of the if else block, the values of the variables are determined based on the conditions met during the if else checks. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, if `f[5]` is true, the 6th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` are all incremented by 1, `j` is appended to list `l` with the value 2, and the 6th element of list `g` is updated to the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` are all incremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, the length of list `l` has increased by 1, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `l` appends the element at index 7 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 19 == 0` and `f[8]` is True, `l` appends the element at index 8 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 19 == 0` and `f[8]` is False, `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is True, `l` appends the element at index 9 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is False, `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g` has the value of `j` at index 9. If `a[i] % 23 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is True, `l` appends the element at index 10 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 23 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is False, `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g` has the value of `j` at index 10. If `a[i] % 29 != 0` and `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is True, the element at index 11 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i] % 29 != 0` and `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is False, `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
