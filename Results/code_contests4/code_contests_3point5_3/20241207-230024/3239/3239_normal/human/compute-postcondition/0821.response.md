Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. In the if part, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged, and `l` is appended with the value at index 7 of list `g`. In the else part, `a`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged. `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
