Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing one element which is the value at index 2 in list `g` if the condition f[2] is true. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing 1. `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list where the element at index 2 is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 3.***
