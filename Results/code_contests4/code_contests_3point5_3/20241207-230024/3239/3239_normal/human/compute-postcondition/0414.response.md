Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing either 0 or 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, lists `f` and `g` are created with 12 zeros each, `j` is assigned either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i]` is an even number, then based on the value of `f[1]`, `l` will contain either 0 or 1 and `g[1]` will be updated accordingly. If `a[i]` is not an even number, then based on the conditions related to divisibility by 3 and 5, the elements of `l` and `g` will be updated. Additionally, `f` will be updated based on the conditions related to divisibility by 3 and 5. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, then further updates will be made to `l`, `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `n` based on divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29, and 31.***
