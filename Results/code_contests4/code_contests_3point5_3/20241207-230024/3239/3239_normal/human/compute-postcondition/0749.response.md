Postcondition: ***`l`, `f`, `g` are lists. If `f[8]` is True, then lists `l`, `f`, and `g` are updated based on the append operation according to the conditions met by `a[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1 if the loop can execute one more time. Otherwise, lists `l`, `f`, and `g` remain unchanged, `j` is set to 2, and the value 2 is added to the list `l`.***
