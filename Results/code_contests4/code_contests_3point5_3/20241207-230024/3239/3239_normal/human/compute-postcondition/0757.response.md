Example Answer:
`l` appends the value at index 10 of list `g` to itself. The values of `l` and `g` are unknown initially, so the output state after this operation is: List `l` is updated with the value at index 10 of list `g`.
Output State: **List `l` is updated with the value at index 10 of list `g`**
