Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` are variables that will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code for the next iteration. If the condition f[10] is true, then `a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` will be updated accordingly. Otherwise, `a`, `f`, `g`, `l` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and this new value of `j` is added to the list `l`.***
