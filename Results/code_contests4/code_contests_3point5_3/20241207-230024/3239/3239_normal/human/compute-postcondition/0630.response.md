Output State: **`l` is a list containing one element, the value of which is `g[5]`. `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0. `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition of `f[5]`. `i` is 0. `n` is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, but is divisible by 11. If `f[5]` is True, the program does nothing. If `f[5]` is False, `l` contains 1, `j` is 1, `g[5]` is 1.**
