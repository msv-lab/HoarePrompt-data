The value at index 11 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The values of `l` and `g` are changed based on the specific values at index 11 of `g`. Therefore, the Output State is: Adjustments need to be made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **Adjustments need to be made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop**
