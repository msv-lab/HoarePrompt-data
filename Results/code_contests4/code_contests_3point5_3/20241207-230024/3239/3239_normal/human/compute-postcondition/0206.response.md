To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop and their relationships. In this case, the variables `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, and `l` are crucial for the loop execution.

Given the postcondition includes conditions based on the value of `a[i]` and subsequent modifications to `l`, `f`, and `g` based on those values, we need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the conditions of the previous iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the key adjustments to be made are:
- Update the value of `i` to move to the next iteration.
- Check the conditions related to `a[i]` to determine the subsequent modifications to `l`, `f`, and `g`.
- Ensure that the relationships between `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, and `l` are maintained as per the postcondition.

State: **After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.**
