Example Answer:
`g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is already incremented by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `g[2]` will hold the updated value of `j`. The value of `l` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[2]` contains the updated value of `j`**
