Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, so the elements in the list `l` will be updated with the new value of `j`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` contains the updated values of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`l` contains the updated values of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1**
