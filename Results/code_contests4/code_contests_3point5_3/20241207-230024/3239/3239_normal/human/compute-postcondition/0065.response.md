Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is a list containing either the element at index 6 of list `g` or the value 1, `f` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0 or where index 6 is assigned the value 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not even, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11, but is divisible by 13. The overall postcondition is based on the execution of the if else block and will result in varying values assigned to `l`, `g`, `j`, and the status of the elements in list `a` and `f` depending on the condition evaluated.***
