Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, but the details of `func_4()` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_1()`, values of `l`, `f`, `g` will be updated, and the final value of `j` will be determined after loop iterations.
Output State: **The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_1()`, values of `l`, `f`, `g` will be updated, and final value of `j` will be determined after loop iterations.**
