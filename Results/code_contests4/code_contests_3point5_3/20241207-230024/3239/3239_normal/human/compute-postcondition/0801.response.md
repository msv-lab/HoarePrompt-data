Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`. The initial state shows that `j` is incremented by 1, so the value of `j` is the incremented value. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
