Postcondition: ***`l` contains the value at index 1 of list `g`, which is 0. `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, a list `f` is created with 12 zeros, `g` is a list with 12 zeros, `j` is assigned the value 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is an even number. If f[1] is True, `l` contains 0. If f[1] is False, `l` contains 1, `g[1]` is assigned the value 1.***
