Example Answer:
`g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` was updated as per the postcondition. Since the loop can continue for one more iteration, `j` has a new value, which is now assigned to `g[10]`. Additionally, `l` now has an additional element which is the value of `j`. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition, `l` has an additional element which is the value of `j`, and the loop can continue for one more iteration**
