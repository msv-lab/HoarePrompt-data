Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are assigned values according to the given conditions. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `l` is modified based on the described conditions, `f[11]` is incremented by 1, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j+1`. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and relationships specified in the precondition.***
