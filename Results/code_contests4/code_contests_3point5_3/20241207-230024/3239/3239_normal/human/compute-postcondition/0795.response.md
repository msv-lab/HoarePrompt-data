Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`, so the value of `j` is added to the end of the list `l`. The values of `a`, `f`, and `g` remain unchanged. `j` is increased by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `l`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`a`, `l`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
