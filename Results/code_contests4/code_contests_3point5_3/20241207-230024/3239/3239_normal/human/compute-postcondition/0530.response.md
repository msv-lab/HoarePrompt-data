Example Answer:
The code appends the element at index 7 of list `g` to list `l`. The values of `a`, `f`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` has the element at index 7 of list `g` appended to it.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` has the element at index 7 of list `g` appended to it**
