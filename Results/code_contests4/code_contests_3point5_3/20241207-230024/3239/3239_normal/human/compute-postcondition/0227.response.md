Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous values of `l` are unknown, so after the execution, `j` will be added to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j` is updated as per the postcondition and the loop can continue for one more iteration, `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j` is updated as per the postcondition and the loop can continue for one more iteration, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
