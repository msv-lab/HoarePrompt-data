Example Answer: 
`g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is increased by 1, so after execution, `g[6]` is equal to the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
