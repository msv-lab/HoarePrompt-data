Output State: **`l` is a list, `f` is a list of 12 elements with the 4th element incremented by 1, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2, not divisible by 3, and divisible by 5. If the value at index 3 of list `f` is True, `l` will contain the value at index 3 of list `g`. If the value at index 3 of list `f` is False, `l` will contain 1.**
