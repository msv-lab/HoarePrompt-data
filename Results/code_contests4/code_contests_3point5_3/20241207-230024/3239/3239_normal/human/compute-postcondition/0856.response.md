Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. After the execution of the if else block, the values of the variables are determined based on the conditions met during the if else checks. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, then `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged. If `f[2]` was originally true, `l` appends the element at index 2 of list `g`. If `f[2]` was originally false, `j` is incremented by 1 and `l` and `g[2]` are updated to the new value of `j`. If `a[i] % 3 != 0`, various actions are taken such as appending elements from list `g` to list `l`, incrementing variables, updating list values, and adding elements to list `l` based on the specific conditions met. The postcondition summarizes all the possible outcomes and actions taken based on the conditions specified in the code.***
