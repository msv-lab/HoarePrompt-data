Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to list `l`, so after execution, the list `l` will contain the value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`**
