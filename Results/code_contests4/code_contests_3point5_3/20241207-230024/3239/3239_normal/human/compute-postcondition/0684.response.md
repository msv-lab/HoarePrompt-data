Output State: **`l` is a list containing the element at index 11 of list `g`, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 23. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 29. Additionally, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 31. When the condition `(f[11])` is true, the program enters the if statement**
