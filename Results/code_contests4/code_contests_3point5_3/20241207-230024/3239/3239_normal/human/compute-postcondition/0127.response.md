Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 can be assigned the value of `j`, `j` may be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is an even number, then the program returns to the initial state. If `a[i]` is not even, then after the execution of the if-else block, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 can be assigned the value of `j`, `j` may be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. Depending on the conditions mentioned in the else part, `l` and the elements of lists `f` and `g` will be updated accordingly.***
