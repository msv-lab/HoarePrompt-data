Postcondition: ***Adjustments need to be made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop. If f[8] is true, a new element is added to list `l` with the value from index 8 of list `g` appended. Otherwise, if f[8] is false, the value of `j` is appended to list `l` and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
