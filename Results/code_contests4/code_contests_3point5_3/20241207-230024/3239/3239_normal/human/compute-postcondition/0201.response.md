Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are variables with specific initial values and relationships. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `l` appends the element at index 5 of list `g`. `f[5]` is checked, and if true, the postcondition holds. Otherwise, if `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `l` appends the value of `g` at index 6. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `f[2]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `l` is appended with the element at index 10 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `l` is modified based on the described conditions, `f[11]` is incremented by 1, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j+1`. If none of these conditions are met, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j` appended with the incremented value of `j`, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[10]` is incremented by 1.***
