Example Answer:
A list `f` is created with 12 elements, all initialized to 0. The list `l` is not affected by this operation as it remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0**
