Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 can be assigned the value of `j`, `j` may be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not even. If the element at index `i` of list `a` is divisible by 3, then `l` is a list containing either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j`. Otherwise, if the element at index `i` of list `a` is not even and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, but divisible by 31 and not divisible by 23, then `l` is either the 10th element of list `g`, the value of `j`, or the 11th element of list `g`. Depending on the conditions, `g[10]` and `g[11]` will be assigned the value of `j`. `f[11]` will be incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, then the value at index 3 of list `f` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the conditions described in the else part are met.***
