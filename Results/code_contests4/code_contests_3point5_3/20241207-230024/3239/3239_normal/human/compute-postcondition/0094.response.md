Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is a list containing the value of `j` that was appended, `f` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. `a[i]` is not even. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 19. Additionally, after the if condition `a[i] % 23 == 0` is true. `f[9]` is false, `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
