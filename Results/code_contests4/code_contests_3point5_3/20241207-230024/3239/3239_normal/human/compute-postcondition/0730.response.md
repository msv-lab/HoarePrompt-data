Example Answer:
`g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the updated value of `j` is unknown as well. Therefore, after execution, `g[5]` contains the updated value of `j`, which is unknown.
Output State: **`g[5]` contains the updated value of `j`, which is unknown**
