According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If there are more elements in the `args` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements left in the `args` list.
State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time there are more elements in the `args` list**
