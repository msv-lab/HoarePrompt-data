Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, and `l` are lists. Adjustments need to be made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, and `f[9]` is True, no changes are made. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is False, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and `g` has the value of `j + 1` at index 9. If `a[i] % 23 != 0`, and `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `f[10]` was initially true, `l` contains the value at index 10 of list `g`. Otherwise, `l` contains the appended value of `j` and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 29 != 0`, adjustments need to be made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` contains the value `j` and `g[11]` contains the value `j` at the end of the execution of the if else block.***
