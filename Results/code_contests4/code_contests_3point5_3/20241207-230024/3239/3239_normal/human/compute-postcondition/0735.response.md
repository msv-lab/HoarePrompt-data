Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The contents of lists `f` and `g` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain the same with the addition of `j` in list `l`.
Output State: **values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain the same with the addition of `j` in list `l`**
