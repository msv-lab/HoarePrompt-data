Example Answer: 
The function `func_4` is called and the return value is assigned to variable `a`. The exact value returned by `func_4` is unknown, so the output state is: The function `func_8` is called with the maximum value in list `l`, and the result of `func_1()` is unknown, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`.
Output State: **The function `func_8` is called with the maximum value in list `l`, and the result of `func_1()` is unknown, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`**
