Postcondition: ***`l` is empty, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, lists `f` and `g` are created with 12 zeros each, `j` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `l` contains the value of `g[10]` which is 0 if `f[10]` is true, otherwise `l` contains 1. If `f[10]` is true, then the element at index 10 in `f` is True, otherwise it's False. If `f[10]` is true, `g[10]` is 0. If `f[10]` is false, `g[10]` is 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, `l` contains 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, `j` is assigned the value 1, and if the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is False, `g[11]` is 1, and `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
