Postcondition: **`l`, `f`, and `g` are lists. If `f[6]` is true, the value at index 6 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, the value at index 6 of list `g` is not appended to list `l`, and `j` is added to list `l`. In either case, the values in the lists `l`, `f`, and `g` may be modified based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1 if the loop can execute one more time.**
