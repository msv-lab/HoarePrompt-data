Example Answer:
`g[2]` is appended to the list `l`. The values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are affected based on the specific values of `g[2]`. The value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned to be incremented, so it remains the same.
Output State: **Adjust the values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, `g[2]` is appended to the list `l`.**
