Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated after the execution of the if else block. If `f[7]` is true, `l` appends the value at index 7 of list `g`. If `f[7]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`, and `g[7]` is increased by 1. The loop can continue for one more iteration with the updated values of the variables.***
