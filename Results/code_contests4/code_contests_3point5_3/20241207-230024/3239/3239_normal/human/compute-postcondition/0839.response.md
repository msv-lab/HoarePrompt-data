Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. If f[10] is True, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged, `l` appends the element at index 10 of list `g`. Otherwise, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are all incremented by 1; `l` appends `j`; `g` has a new value at index 10 which is equal to the value of `j`.***
