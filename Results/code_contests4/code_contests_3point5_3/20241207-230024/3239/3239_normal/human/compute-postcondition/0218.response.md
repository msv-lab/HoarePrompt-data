Example Answer:
If `f[2]` is true, it will be incremented by 1. If `f[2]` is false, `j` will be incremented by 1, and `j` will be appended to `n`, `a`, `i`, `f`, `g` at index 2. The loop can continue for one more iteration. In both cases, `l` will be updated by appending the value of `j`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the execution of the if else block.**
