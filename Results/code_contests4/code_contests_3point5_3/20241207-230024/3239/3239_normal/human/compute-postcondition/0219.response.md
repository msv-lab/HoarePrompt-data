Example Answer:
`l` is updated by appending the element at index 3 of list `g`. The values of `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` remain the same as they were updated in the if else block. The loop can continue for one more iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration**
