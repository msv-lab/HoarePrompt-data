Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the state of the program will be as follows: If `a[i]` is divisible by 2, `l` will contain a list with one element which is 0. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, `l` will contain the value at index 2 of list `g` if `f[2]` is True, otherwise, `l` will contain 1. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `l` will contain the value at index 3 of list `g` if `f[3]` is True, otherwise, `l` will contain 1. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `l` will contain the value at index 4 of list `g`, `f[4]` will be updated to 2, `g[4]` will be updated to 1, and `j` will be 1. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `l` will contain the value at index 5 of list `g` if `f[5]` is False, otherwise, `l` will contain 1, `j` will be 1, and `g[5]` will be 1. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `l` will contain the value at index 6 of list `g`, `f[6]` will be updated to 2, `g[6]` will be updated to 1, and `j` will be 1. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `f[7]` will be updated to either 2 or 1 based on its previous value. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `l` will contain the value at index 8 of `g`, `f[8]` will be incremented by 1, and `g[8]` will be set to 1. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `l` will contain the value at index 9 of `g`, `f[9]` will be incremented by 1 or set to 1, and `g[9]` will be set to 1. If `a[i] % 29 != 0`, `l` will contain one element, `f[10]` will be incremented by 1, and `g[10]` will be set to 1. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `a[i]` will be divisible by 31 and `j` will be updated to 1 based on the conditions.***
