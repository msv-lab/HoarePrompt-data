Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented by 1. The loop can continue for one more iteration.***
