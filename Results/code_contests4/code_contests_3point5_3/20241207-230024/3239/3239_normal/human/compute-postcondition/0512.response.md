Example Answer:
The code appends the value at index 4 of list `g` to list `l`. The previous values of variables `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` has the value that was at index 4 of list `g` appended to it.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` has the value that was at index 4 of list `g` appended to it**
