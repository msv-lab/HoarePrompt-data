Example Answer:
`g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. The initial value of `j` is unknown, so the final value of `g[7]` is also unknown. The variable `l` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the updated values of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the updated values of `j`**
