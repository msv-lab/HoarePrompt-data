Postcondition: ***`l` is empty, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, a list `f` is created with 12 zeros, a list `g` is created with 12 zeros, `j` is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 7. If the fifth element of list `f` is true, `l` contains the value of the fifth element of list `g`, which is 0. Otherwise, `l` contains the value 1.***
