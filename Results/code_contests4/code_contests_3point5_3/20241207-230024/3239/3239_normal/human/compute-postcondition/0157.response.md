Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j` appended with the updated value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is assigned the updated value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `l` appends the element at index 5 of list `g`. If the condition `f[5]` is true, the postcondition holds. Otherwise, the else part is executed and the postcondition remains the same.***
