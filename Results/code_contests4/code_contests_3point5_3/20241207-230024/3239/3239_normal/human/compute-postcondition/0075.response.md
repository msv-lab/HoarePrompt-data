Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is a list containing the element at index 7 of list `g`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not even, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 5, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 7, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 11, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 13. If the element at index `i` of list `a` is divisible by 17 and the 7th element of list `f` is true, then `l` is updated to contain the element at index 7 of list `g`. If the condition is not met, `l` is updated to contain `1` and `g[7]` is set to 1.***
