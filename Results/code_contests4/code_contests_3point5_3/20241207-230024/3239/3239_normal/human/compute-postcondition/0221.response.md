Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`, so the value of `j` will be added to the list `l`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition and the loop can continue for one more iteration, `l` contains the appended value of `j`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g` are updated as per the postcondition and the loop can continue for one more iteration, `l` contains the appended value of `j`**
