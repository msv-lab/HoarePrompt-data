Example Answer:
`g[3]` is appended to the list `l`. The previous values of `l` and `g` are unknown, so after execution, the value of `l` will depend on the value at index 3 of `g`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` has been updated with the value at index 3 of `g`.
Output State: **`l` has been updated with the value at index 3 of `g`**
