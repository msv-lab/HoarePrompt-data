Example Answer:
`j` is appended to list `l`, so `l` now contains the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [1], `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is even, the value at index 1 in list `f` is 0.
Output State: **`l` is [1], `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is even, the value at index 1 in list `f` is 0**
