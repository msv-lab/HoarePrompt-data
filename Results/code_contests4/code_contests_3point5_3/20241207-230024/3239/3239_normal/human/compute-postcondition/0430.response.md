Example Answer:
The value of `j` is added to the list `l`. Since the initial state mentions that `j` is increased by 1, the value of `j` is now one more than the previous value. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`**
