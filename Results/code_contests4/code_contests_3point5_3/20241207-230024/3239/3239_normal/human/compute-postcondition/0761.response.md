Postcondition: ***`l`, `f`, `g` are lists. If `f[10]` is True, `l` is updated with the value at index 10 of list `g`. Otherwise, values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`, and the value of `g` at index 10 is updated to the new value of `j`.***
