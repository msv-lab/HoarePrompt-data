Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` are updated based on the conditions in the code. If `f[1]` is true, `l` appends the element at index 1 of list `g`. Otherwise, `a`, `f`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged; `j` is increased to 4, `l` contains [3], and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, resulting in `g` becoming `[1, 4]`.***
