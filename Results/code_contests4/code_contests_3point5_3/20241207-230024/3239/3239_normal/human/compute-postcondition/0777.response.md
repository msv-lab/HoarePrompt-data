Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. If `a[i]` % 5 == 0, `l`, `f`, `g` are modified based on the previous state of `f[3]`. If `a[i]` % 7 == 0, `f[4]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and element `j` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i]` % 11 == 0 and `f[5]` is True, the value at index 5 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i]` % 11 == 0 and `f[5]` is False, `g[5]` contains the updated value of `j`. If `a[i]` % 13 == 0, `l`, `f`, and `g` lists may be modified based on conditions; `i` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` % 17 == 0, `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` % 19 == 0, `f[8]` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to 2, and 2 is added to list `l`. If `a[i]` % 23 == 0 and `f[9]` is True, adjust the values in list `l` based on the conditions met by `a[i]`. If `a[i]` % 29 == 0 and `f[9]` is False, update `l` based on the condition of `f[10]`, `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to list `l`. If `a[i]` % 31 == 0 and `f[11]` is true, the program modifies `l`, `f`, `g`. If `a[i]` % 31 == 0 and `f[11]` is false, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
