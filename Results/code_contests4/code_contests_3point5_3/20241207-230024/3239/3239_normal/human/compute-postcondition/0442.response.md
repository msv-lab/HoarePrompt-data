Example Answer:
A value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state mentions that variable `j` is increased by 1, after appending, the value of `j` will be one more than the initial value. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
