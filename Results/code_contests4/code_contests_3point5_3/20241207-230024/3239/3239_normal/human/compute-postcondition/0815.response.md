Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` are integers. If `f[6]` is true, then `l` has appended the element at index 6 of list `g`. Otherwise, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` have all been incremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, the length of list `l` has increased by 1, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
