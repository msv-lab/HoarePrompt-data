Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The values of the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, and the values of lists `l`, `f`, `g` are unknown.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, and the values of lists `l`, `f`, `g` are unknown**
