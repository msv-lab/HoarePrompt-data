Example Answer:
`j` is increased by 1, and then `j` is appended to the list `l`. So, the value of `j` is now increased by 1 and added to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
