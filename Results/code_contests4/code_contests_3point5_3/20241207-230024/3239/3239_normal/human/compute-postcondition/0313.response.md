Output State: **`l` is a list containing either 0 or 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, lists `f` and `g` are created with 12 zeros each, `j` is assigned either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2. The element `a[i]` is divisible by 3. If `f[2]` is true, `l` is 0 and `g[2]` is 0. If `f[2]` is false, `l` is 1 and `g[2]` is 1. `f[2]` is incremented by 1.**
