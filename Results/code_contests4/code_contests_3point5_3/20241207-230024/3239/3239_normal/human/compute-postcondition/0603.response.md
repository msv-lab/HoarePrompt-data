Postcondition: ***`l` is an empty list, `f`, `g` are lists of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 5. The value at index 3 of list `f` is evaluated as True***
