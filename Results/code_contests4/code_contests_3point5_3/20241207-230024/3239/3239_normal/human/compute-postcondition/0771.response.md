Postcondition: ***`l`, `f`, `g` are lists. If `f[9]` is True and `a[i]` % 23 == 0, adjust the values in list `l` based on the conditions met by `a[i]`, `f` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, and increment `i` by 1 if the loop can execute one more time. If `f[9]` is False and `a[i]` % 29 == 0, `l`, `f`, `g` lists may have been updated based on the condition of `f[10]`. `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to list `l`. If `a[i]` % 31 == 0 and `f[11]` is true, then `l`, `f`, `g` have been modified. If `a[i]` % 31 == 0 and `f[11]` is false, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
