Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is the return value of `func_4()`, `l` contains the element at index 4 of list `g`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements with the 5th element incremented by 1, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0, the loop executes the first time when `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not even, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 5, and the element at index `i` of list `a` is divisible by 7. If the element at index 4 of list `f` is true, then `l` contains the element at index 4 of list `g`. If the element at index 4 of list `f` is false, then `l` contains the value 1, `g` has the 5th element set to 1, `j` is 1, the loop executes, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not even, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3, the element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 5, and the element at index `i` of list `a` is divisible by 7.**
