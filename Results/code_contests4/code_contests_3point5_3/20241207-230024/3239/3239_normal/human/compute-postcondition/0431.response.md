Example Answer:
`g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. The initial value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `g[3]` is updated with `j` increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, `g[3]` is updated with the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, `g[3]` is updated with the new value of `j`**
