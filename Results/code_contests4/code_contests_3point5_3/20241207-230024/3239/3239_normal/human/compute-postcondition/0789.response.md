Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `j` is now one more than the initial value. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
