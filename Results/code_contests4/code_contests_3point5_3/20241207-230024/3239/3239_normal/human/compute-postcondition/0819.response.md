Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` has been incremented by 1, the new list `l` will contain the incremented value of `j`. The other variables `a`, `f`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged; `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged; `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
