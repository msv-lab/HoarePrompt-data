Example Answer:
The value at index 11 of list `g` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, but `g` is updated with the value of `j` at index 11. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j+1`, `i`, `f`, `g`, and `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration, `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j+1`, `i`, `f`, `g`, and `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration, `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`**
