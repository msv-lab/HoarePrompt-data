Example Answer: 
The function `func_1()` is called and its return value is assigned to `n`. The further operations based on conditions specified in the loop will depend on the value of `n`. The loop will execute one more time if the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0. The values of `l`, `f`, `g` will be updated based on divisibility conditions. The final value of `j` will be determined after all iterations of the loop. 
Output State: **The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_1()`, values of `l`, `f`, `g` will be updated, and final value of `j` will be determined after loop iterations.**
