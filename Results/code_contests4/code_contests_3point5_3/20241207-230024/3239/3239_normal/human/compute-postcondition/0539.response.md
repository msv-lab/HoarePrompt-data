Example Answer:
`g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. So, after execution, `g[8]` contains the incremented value of `j`. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, `g[8]` is equal to the new value of `j`**
