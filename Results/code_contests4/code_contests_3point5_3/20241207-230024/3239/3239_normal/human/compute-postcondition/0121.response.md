Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` can be either the 10th element of list `g`, the value of `j` that was appended, or the 11th element of list `g`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements with the 9th element incremented by 1, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not even. The element at index `i` of list `a` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, but divisible by 31 and not divisible by 23. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `l` will be the 11th element of list `g`. Depending on the values of `f[10]` and `f[11]`, `l` will either contain the 11th element of list `g` or the value of `j`. `g[10]` and `g[11]` will be assigned the value of `j`. `f[11]` will be incremented by 1.***
