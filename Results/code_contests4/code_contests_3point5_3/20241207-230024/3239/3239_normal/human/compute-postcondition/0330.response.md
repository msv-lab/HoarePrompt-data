Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `l` was initially empty and `j` is 1, after execution, `l` will contain the value 1. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`l` contains the value 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, a list `f` with 12 zeros, a list `g` with 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 7. The element at index 4 in `f` is not True.**
