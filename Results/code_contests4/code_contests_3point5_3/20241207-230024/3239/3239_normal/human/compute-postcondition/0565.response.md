Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` are variables that will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, then the variables will be updated according to the conditions specified in the code. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, the variables will be updated as per the conditions mentioned. If `a[i] % 19 == 0` and `f[8]` is True, `a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` will be updated based on the conditions specified. If `a[i] % 19 == 0` and `f[8]` is False, `j` is increased by 1, `l` is equal to the new value of `j`, and `g[8]` is also set to the new value of `j`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is True, `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` contains the value at index 9 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is False, `j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the incremented value of `j`; `g[9]` contains the incremented value of `j`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `a`, `f`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and this new value of `j` is added to the list `l`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `a`, `f`, and `j` are updated accordingly. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is True, `l` appends the value at index 11 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is False, `g[11]` contains the new value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1.***
