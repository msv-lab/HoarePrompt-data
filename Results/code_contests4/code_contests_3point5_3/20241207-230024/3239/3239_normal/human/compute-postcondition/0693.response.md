Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing the value at index 9 of list `g` if a[i] % 23 == 0. In this case, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0 with `f[9]` now being 1, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If a[i] % 29 == 0, `f` is a list of 12 elements where the 10th element is incremented by 1 if f[10] is true, otherwise the 10th element is set to 1. `g` is a list of 12 elements where the 10th element is always 1. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 but is divisible by 29. The element at index 10 in list `f` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. If a[i] % 29 != 0, `l` is a list with one element. `f` is a list of 12 elements where the 11th element is incremented by 1. `g` is a list of 12 elements where the 11th element is set to 1. `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29. Additionally, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 31.***
