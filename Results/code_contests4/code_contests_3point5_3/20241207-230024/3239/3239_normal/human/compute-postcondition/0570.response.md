Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` are variables that will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code. If `a[i] % 2 == 0`, `a`, `f`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged, `j` is increased to 4, `l` contains [3], `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, resulting in `g` becoming `[1, 4]`. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, `f[2]` determines the next steps. If `f[2]` is True, then the third element of list `g` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, and `g[2]` is the updated value of `j`. `f[2]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `f[3]` determines the next steps. If `f[3]` is true, `l` will be updated with the value at index 3 of `g`. If `f[3]` is false, `j` will be increased by 1 and the list `g` will have the updated value at index 3. `f[3]` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `f[4]` is increased by 1, `a`, `f`, `g`, `j` will be updated. If `f[4]` is True, `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` appends the value at index 4 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged; `l` will be updated based on the condition of `f[5]`. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, the variables will be updated. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, the variables will be updated. If `a[i] % 19 == 0` and `f[8]` is True, `a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` will be updated. If `a[i] % 19 == 0` and `f[8]` is False, `j` is increased by 1, `l` is equal to the new value of `j`, and `g[8]` is also set to the new value of `j`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is True, `l` contains the value at index 9 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is False, `j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the incremented value of `j`; `g[9]` contains the incremented value of `j`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `j` is incremented by 1 and this new value of `j` is added to the list `l`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `a`, `f`, and `j` are updated accordingly. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is True, `l` appends the value at index 11 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is False, `g[11]` contains the new value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1.***
