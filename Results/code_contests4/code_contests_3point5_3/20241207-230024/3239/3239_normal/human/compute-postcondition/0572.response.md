Output State: **`l` is a list containing values based on the conditions specified in the loop, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, lists `f` and `g` are created with values updated based on the divisibility conditions, `j` is assigned the final value after all the iterations of the loop, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `l`, `f`, and `g` will be dependent on the divisibility conditions specified for each element in `a`, with `j` being updated accordingly.**
