Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, and `f[9]` is True, the variables remain unchanged, and `l` appends the element at index 9 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is False, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `i` are all incremented by 1, `j` remains unchanged, `l` appends the value of `j` to its list, and `g` has the value of `j` at index 9. If `a[i] % 23 != 0`, and `a[i] % 29 == 0`, and `f[10]` is True, the variables remain unchanged, and `l` appends the element at index 10 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 23 != 0`, and `a[i] % 29 == 0`, and `f[10]` is False, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `i` are all incremented by 1, `j` remains unchanged, `l` appends the value of `j`, and `g` has the value of `j` at index 10. If `a[i] % 29 != 0`, and `a[i] % 31 == 0`, and `f[11]` is True, the variables remain unchanged, and the element at index 11 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i] % 29 != 0`, and `a[i] % 31 == 0`, and `f[11]` is False, `a`, `f`, `g`, and `i` are updated based on the next loop iteration, `j` remains unchanged, `l` contains the appended value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
