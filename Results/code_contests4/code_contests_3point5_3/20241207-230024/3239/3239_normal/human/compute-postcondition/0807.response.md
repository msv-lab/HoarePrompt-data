Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` was incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `j` that is appended to `l` is 2. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged; `j` is appended to list `l` with the value 2.
Output State: **`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged; `j` is appended to list `l` with the value 2**
