Postcondition: ***`a`, `f`, `g`, `l`, and `j` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the code. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `a`, `f`, and `j` are updated accordingly. If `f[11]` is True, `l` appends the value at index 11 of list `g`. Otherwise, `g[11]` contains the new value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1.***
