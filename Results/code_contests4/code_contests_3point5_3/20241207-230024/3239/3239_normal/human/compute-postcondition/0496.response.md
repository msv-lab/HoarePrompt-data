Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`, increasing the size of the list by 1. The value of `j` is increased by 1, so if `j` was initially 3, after appending it to the list, `l` will contain [3] and `j` will be 4. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `f`, `g`, `l` remain unchanged; `j` is increased to 4 and `l` contains [3].
Output State: **`a`, `f`, `g`, `l` remain unchanged; `j` is increased to 4 and `l` contains [3]**
