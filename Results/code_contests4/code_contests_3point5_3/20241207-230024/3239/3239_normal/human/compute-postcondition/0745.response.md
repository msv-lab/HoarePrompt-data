Example Answer:
The value at index 8 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The previous values of lists `l`, `f`, and `g` are not provided, so the output state is: Lists `l`, `f`, and `g` are updated based on the append operation.
Output State: **Lists `l`, `f`, and `g` are updated based on the append operation**
