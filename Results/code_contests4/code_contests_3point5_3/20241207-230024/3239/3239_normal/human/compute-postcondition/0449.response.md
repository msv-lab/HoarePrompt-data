Example Answer:
`g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`, so the value of `g[6]` is updated to whatever value `j` holds. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` has been updated with the appended value of `j`, `g[6]` is updated to the value of `j`.
Output State: **`l` has been updated with the appended value of `j`, `g[6]` is updated to the value of `j`**
