Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the execution of the if else block. If `f[2]` is true, `l` is updated by appending the 3rd element of list `g`. If `f[2]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, `n`, `a`, `i`, `f`, `g` have `j` appended to them at index 2, and `l` is updated by appending `j`. The loop can continue for one more iteration.***
