Example Answer: 
`g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. So, after execution, `g[7]` will be increased by 1 as well. The list `l` contains the value of `j`, which is now increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g[7]` is also increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g[7]` is also increased by 1**
