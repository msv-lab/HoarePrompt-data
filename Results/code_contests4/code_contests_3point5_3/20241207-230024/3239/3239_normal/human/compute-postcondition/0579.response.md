Example Answer: 
`g` is assigned a list of 12 elements, all initialized to 0. Therefore, after execution, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0**
