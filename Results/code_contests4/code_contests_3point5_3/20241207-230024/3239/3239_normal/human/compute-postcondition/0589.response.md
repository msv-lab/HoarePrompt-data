Postcondition: ***`l` is a list with one element which is 0, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is even. If the value at index 1 of list `f` is True, then `l` remains [0]. Otherwise, `l` is updated to [1], `g` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` becomes 1, and the value at index 1 in list `f` is 0.***
