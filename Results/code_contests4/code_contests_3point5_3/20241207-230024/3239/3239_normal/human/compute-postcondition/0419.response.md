Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is stored in index 1 of list `g`. The value of `j` is already incremented by 1 in the initial state, so the value stored in index 1 of list `g` will be the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and `g` contains the updated value of `j` at index 1.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g` contains the updated value of `j` at index 1**
