Postcondition: ***`a` is a list, `f`, `g`, and `l` are lists as well. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `f[10]` was initially true, `l` contains the value at index 10 of list `g`. Otherwise, `l` contains the appended value of `j` and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 29 != 0`, adjustments need to be made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` contains the value `j` and `g[11]` contains the value `j` at the end of the execution of the if else block.***
