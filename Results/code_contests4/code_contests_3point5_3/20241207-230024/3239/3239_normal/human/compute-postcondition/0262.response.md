Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the loop can continue for one more iteration. The other variables remain updated as per the postcondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition, and the loop can continue for one more iteration**
