Example Answer:
`g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, but the previous values of `g` and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` contains the appended value of `j`, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.
Output State: **`l` contains the appended value of `j`, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`**
