Example Answer: 
`j` is incremented by 1. The values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **values in the lists `l`, `f`, `g` are unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1**
