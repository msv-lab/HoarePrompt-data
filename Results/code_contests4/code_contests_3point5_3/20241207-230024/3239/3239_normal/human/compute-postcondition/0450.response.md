Postcondition: ***Adjustments need to be made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop. If `f[6]` is True, list `l` has a new element from index 6 of list `g`. If `f[6]` is False, `l` has been updated with the appended value of `j`, and `g[6]` is updated to the value of `j`.***
