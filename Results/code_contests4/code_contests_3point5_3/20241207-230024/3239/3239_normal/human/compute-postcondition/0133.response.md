Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is either the element at index 2 of list `g` or the value of `j` with the appended value of `g[1]`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 2 is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`***
