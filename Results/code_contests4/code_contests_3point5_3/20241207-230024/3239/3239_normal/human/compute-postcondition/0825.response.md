Example Answer: 
`j`, which was incremented by 1, is appended to the list `l`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` and `i` are all incremented by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` and `i` are all incremented by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
