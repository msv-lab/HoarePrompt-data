Postcondition: ***`l` is empty, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, a list `f` is created with 12 zeros, `g` is a list with 12 zeros, `j` is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 13. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 17, and `f[7]` is true***
