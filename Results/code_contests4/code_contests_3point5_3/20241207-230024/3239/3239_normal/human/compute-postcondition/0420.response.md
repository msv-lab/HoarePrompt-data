Postcondition: ***Adjustments need to be made based on the conditions related to the next iteration of the loop. If `f[1]` is true, then `g[1]` is appended to the list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and `g` contains the updated value of `j` at index 1.***
