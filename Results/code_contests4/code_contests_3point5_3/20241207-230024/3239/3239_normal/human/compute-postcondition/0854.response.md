Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. After the execution of the if else block, the values of the variables are determined based on the conditions met during the if else checks. Depending on the conditions, different actions are taken such as appending elements from list `g` to list `l`, incrementing variables, updating list values, and adding elements to list `l`. The postcondition summarizes all the possible outcomes and actions taken based on the conditions specified in the code.***
