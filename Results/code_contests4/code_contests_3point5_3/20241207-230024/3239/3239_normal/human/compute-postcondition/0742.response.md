Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the 7th element of list `g`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value stored in `g[7]`. However, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, so the output state is: variable `j` is assigned to the 7th element of list `g`, `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is assigned to the 7th element of list `g`, `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
