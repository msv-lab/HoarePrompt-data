Example Answer:
The value at index 8 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The state of the variables `l` and `g` are affected, but the previous values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: list `l` has a new element, value from index 8 of list `g` is appended.
Output State: **list `l` has a new element, value from index 8 of list `g` is appended**
