Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `l` is the 11th element of list `g`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements with the 11th element incremented by 1, `g` is a list containing 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is divisible by 29. If `f[10]` is true, `l` is the 11th element of list `g`. Otherwise, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
