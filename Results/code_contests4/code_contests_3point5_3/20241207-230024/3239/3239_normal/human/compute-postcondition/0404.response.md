Postcondition: ***`l` is empty, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, lists `f` and `g` are created with 12 zeros each, `j` is assigned the value 1, `n` is greater than 0. All elements of `a` are not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. If the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is False, `l` contains the value 1, `g[11]` is 1, and `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
