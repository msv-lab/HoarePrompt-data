Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing the value at index 8 of list `g`, `f` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `g` is a list of 12 elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, n is greater than 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 17. Additionally, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 19. If `f[8]` is true, then `l` will be a list containing the value at index 8 of list `g`. If `f[8]` is false, `l` will be a list containing 1, `j` will be 1, `f` will remain the same as initialized, `g[8]` will be 1, and `j` will be 1***
