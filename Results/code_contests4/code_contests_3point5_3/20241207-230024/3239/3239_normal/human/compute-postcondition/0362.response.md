Postcondition: ***`l` is empty, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4`, lists `f` and `g` have 12 zeros each, `j` is 0, the loop executes while `n` is greater than 0, all elements of `a` are not divisible by 2, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 17, and `f[7]` is true. Additionally, `l` has been appended with the value 1, and an IndexError occurs while trying to assign a value to the 8th element of list `g`.***
