Example Answer:
`g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` was previously increased by 1. The elements of the list `l` now contain the new value of `j` at index 4. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, elements of list `l` now contain the new value of `j` at index 4.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, elements of list `l` now contain the new value of `j` at index 4**
