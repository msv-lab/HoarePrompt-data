Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, the value of `j` is incremented by 1 before being appended to the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
