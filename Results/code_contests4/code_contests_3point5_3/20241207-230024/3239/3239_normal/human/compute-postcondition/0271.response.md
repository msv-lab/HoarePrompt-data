Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition mentioned earlier. If `f[11]` is true, `l` appends the element at index 11 of list `g`. If `f[11]` is false, `n`, `a`, `j+1`, `i`, `f`, `g`, and `l` are updated as per the postcondition. The loop can continue for one more iteration, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
