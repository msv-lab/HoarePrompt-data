Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned to the 9th index of list `g`, so `g[9]` now holds the value of `j`. The value of `j` was increased by 1 in the initial state, so `g[9]` will hold the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[9]` now holds the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[9]` now holds the updated value of `j`**
