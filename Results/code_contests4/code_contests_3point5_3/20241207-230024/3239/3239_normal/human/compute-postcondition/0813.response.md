The value of `j` has been appended to list `l`, which means the list `l` has increased in length by 1. The other variables `a`, `f`, `g`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` and `i` have all been incremented by 1 as `j` is increased by 1; the length of list `l` has increased by 1.
Output State: **`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` and `i` have all been incremented by 1 as `j` is increased by 1; the length of list `l` has increased by 1**
