Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, the previous value of `j` is unknown. Other variables remain updated as per the postcondition and the loop can continue for one more iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition and the loop can continue for one more iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `j`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `l` are updated as per the postcondition and the loop can continue for one more iteration**
