According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of the function `func_1()`. If the result of `func_1()` is greater than zero, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the function `func_8` is called with the maximum value in list `l`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the result of `func_1()` must be greater than zero.

State: **The function `func_8` is called with the maximum value in list `l`, for the loop to execute one more time the result of `func_1()` must be greater than zero**
