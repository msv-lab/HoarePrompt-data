Example Answer: 
A value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, but the previous value of `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1; `l` is appended with the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1; `l` is appended with the incremented value of `j`**
