Example Answer:
`g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, `g[5]` now holds the updated value of `j`. The list `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`g[5]` is the updated value of `j`, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
