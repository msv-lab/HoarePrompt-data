Example Answer:
`f[3]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state is not provided for `f`, the new value of `f[3]` could be either true or false. If `f[3]` was true initially, then `g[3]` is appended to the end of `l`. If `f[3]` was false initially, then `j` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `j` is stored in `l` and `g` at index 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `f`, `g` are lists with possible changes based on the previous state of `f[3]`.
Output State: **`l`, `f`, `g` are lists with possible changes based on the previous state of `f[3]`**
