According to the code, the loop can execute based on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the function `func_8` is called with arguments unpacked from list `l`, leading to further operations based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of `l`, `f`, `g` will be updated based on the divisibility conditions. The final value of `j` will be determined after all iterations of the loop. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0.
