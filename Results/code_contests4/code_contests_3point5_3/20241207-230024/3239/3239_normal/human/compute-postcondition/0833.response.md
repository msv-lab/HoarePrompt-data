Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are variables. If `f[9]` is true, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain unchanged, and `l` appends the element at index 9 of list `g`. If `f[9]` is false, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `l` appends the value of `j` to its list, and `g` now has the value of `j` at index 9.***
