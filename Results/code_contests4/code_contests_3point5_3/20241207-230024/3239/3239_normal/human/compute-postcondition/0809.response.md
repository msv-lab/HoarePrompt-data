Postcondition: ***`a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are all integers. If `f[5]` is true, the 6th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged. Additionally, `j` is appended to list `l` with the value 2, and the 6th element of list `g` is updated to the value of `j`.***
