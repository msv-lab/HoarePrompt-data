Example Answer: 
`g` is a list that does not exist yet and we are trying to assign a value to its 8th element. This will raise an IndexError since lists are zero-indexed, so element 7 is the last element. The value of `j` is unknown and `l` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` has been appended with the value 1 and we encounter an IndexError while trying to assign a value to the 8th element of list `g`.
Output State: **`l` has been appended with the value 1 and we encounter an IndexError while trying to assign a value to the 8th element of list `g`**
