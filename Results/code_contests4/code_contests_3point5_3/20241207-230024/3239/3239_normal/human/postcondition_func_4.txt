The function `func_5` sets up standard input and output to read from and write to files to process a sequence of composite integers based on the given constraints. It does not accept any parameters and does not provide any specific output. The function handles test cases where each case includes an integer `n` representing the number of composite integers in a sequence `a`, with each `a_i` falling within the range of 4 to 1000. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
