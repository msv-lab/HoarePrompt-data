Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program seems to be assigning colors to elements based on their divisibility by certain prime numbers. However, the program does not ensure that the greatest common divisor of elements of the same color is greater than 1 as required by the problem description. This means that the coloring done by the program may not satisfy Alice's requirements.

Additionally, the program is missing the implementation of the `func_8` function which is called to print the output. This will lead to a NameError when the program is executed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and needs to be revised to correctly implement the problem requirements.
