You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A positive integer is called composite if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.

Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,…,a_n.

She wants to choose an integer m ≤ 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:

  * for each color from 1 to m there is at least one element of this color; 
  * each element is colored and colored exactly one color; 
  * the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, i.e. \gcd(a_i, a_j)>1 for each pair i, j if these elements are colored the same color. 



Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.

Alice showed already that if all a_i ≤ 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m ≤ 11.

Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the amount of numbers in a sequence a.

The second line of the test case contains n composite integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case print 2 lines. The first line should contain a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 11) — the number of used colors. Consider colors to be numbered from 1 to m. The second line should contain any coloring that satisfies the above conditions. Print n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m), where c_i is the color of the i-th element. If there are multiple solutions then you can print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Remember that each color from 1 to m should be used at least once. Any two elements of the same color should not be coprime (i.e. their GCD should be greater than 1).

Example

4 9
23
437 519 865 808 909 391 194 291 237 395 323 365 511 497 781 737 871 559 731 697 779 841 961


Output


1
1 1 1
2
2 1
11
4 7 8 10 7 3 10 7 7 8 3 1 1 5 5 9 2 2 3 3 4 11 6

Note

In the first test case, \gcd(6,10)=2, \gcd(6,15)=3 and \gcd(10,15)=5. Therefore, it's valid to color all elements the same color. Note that there are other colorings which satisfy Alice's requirement in this test case.

In the second test case there is only one element of each color, so the coloring definitely satisfies Alice's requirement.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
