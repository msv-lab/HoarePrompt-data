Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes in the number of cities and their coordinates, sorts the coordinates, then iterates through the sorted coordinates to find the minimum distance between two pairs of cities. It keeps track of the minimum distance and the count of pairs with that distance. The program then prints the minimum distance and the count. The logic of the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It handles all potential cases where there can be multiple pairs of cities with the same minimum distance.
