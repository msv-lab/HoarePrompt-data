Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of cities and their coordinates, sorts the coordinates, calculates the distance between adjacent cities, finds the minimum distance, and counts the pairs with that distance. The logic is correctly implemented and covers all potential cases as described in the problem. The program is able to handle multiple pairs of cities with the minimal possible distance and outputs the correct results.
