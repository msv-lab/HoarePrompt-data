Example Answer:
`dist` is assigned the value `temp_dist`, where `temp_dist` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `dist` is unknown. The value of `index` should be incremented by 1, however, the previous value of `index` is unknown. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `index` should be incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `index` should be incremented by 1**
