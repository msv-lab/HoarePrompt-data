Example Answer: 
The variable `coordinates` is assigned the result of mapping the integers input from standard input after splitting them. The list `coordinates` contains the city coordinates read from input. Since the variables `n` and `cities` are not mentioned in the code snippet, their values remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, The list of city coordinates, `a1, a2, ..., an`, consists of `n` pairwise distinct integers where -10^9 <= ai <= 10^9. `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates read from input**
