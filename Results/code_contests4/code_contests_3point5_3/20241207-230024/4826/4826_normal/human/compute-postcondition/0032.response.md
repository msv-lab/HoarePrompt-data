Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `index` is incremented by 1. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, `count` is increased by 1.***
