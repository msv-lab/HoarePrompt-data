Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `index` is 0 and `x` is the first element in `coordinates`. Additionally, `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1***
