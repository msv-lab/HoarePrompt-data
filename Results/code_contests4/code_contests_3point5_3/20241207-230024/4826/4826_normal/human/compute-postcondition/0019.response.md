Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `dist` is updated to `temp_dist`, `count` is 1, `index` is the index of the current element in `coordinates`, `x` is the current element in `coordinates`, and `temp_dist` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `coordinates` and `x**.
