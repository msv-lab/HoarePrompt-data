Example Answer:
`temp_dist` is assigned the value of `coordinates[index + 1] - x`, where `x` is not defined in the initial state. As `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, and the loop should execute one more time, `index` should be incremented by 1. The value of `index` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `temp_dist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `index` should be incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `index` should be incremented by 1**
