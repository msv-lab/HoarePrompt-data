Example Answer:
The list `coordinates` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the `coordinates` list are not provided, but after sorting, the list is in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, The list of city coordinates, `a1, a2, ..., an`, consists of `n` pairwise distinct integers where -10^9 <= ai <= 10^9. `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, The list of city coordinates, `a1, a2, ..., an`, consists of `n` pairwise distinct integers where -10^9 <= ai <= 10^9. `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order**
