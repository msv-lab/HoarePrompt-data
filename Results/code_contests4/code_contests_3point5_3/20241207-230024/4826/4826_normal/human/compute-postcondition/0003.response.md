Example Answer:
The variable `dist` is assigned the value `2 * 10 ** 9`, which is equal to 2000000000. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, The list of city coordinates, `a1, a2, ..., an`, consists of `n` pairwise distinct integers where -10^9 <= ai <= 10^9. `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `dist` is 2000000000.
