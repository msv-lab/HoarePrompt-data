The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a list of city coordinates, a1, a2, ..., an, where n is an integer satisfying 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, and each coordinate ai is a pairwise distinct integer within the range -10^9 to 10^9. The function does not return any specific value as the output is not provided.
