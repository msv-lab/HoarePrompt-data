Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `dist` may be updated or remain at 2000000000, `count` is increased by 1, `index` is the index of the current element in `coordinates`, `x` is the current element in `coordinates`, and `temp_dist` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `coordinates` and `x. If `temp_dist` equals `dist`, then `count` is increased by 1.***
