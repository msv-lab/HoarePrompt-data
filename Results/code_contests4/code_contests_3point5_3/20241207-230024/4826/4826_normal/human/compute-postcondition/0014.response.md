Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` contains the city coordinates sorted in ascending order, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 1, `index` is 0, `x` is the first element in `coordinates`, `temp_dist` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `coordinates` and `x`, and `temp_dist` is not less than `dist`. When entering the if condition, `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, and `count` is updated to 1.***
