Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input as described in the problem statement.
- It sorts the coordinates to make it easier to calculate the distances between consecutive cities.
- It correctly calculates the smallest distance `dist` between consecutive cities.
- The code counts how many times this smallest distance occurs, which is in line with the problem description.
- Finally, it prints the smallest distance and the count.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases described in the problem statement.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correct.
