Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the minimal possible distance between two pairs of cities and the quantity of pairs which have this distance. It sorts the city coordinates in ascending order, then iterates through the sorted coordinates to find the smallest distance between two consecutive cities and counts the number of pairs with this distance. The program outputs the minimal distance and the quantity of pairs with this distance as required by the problem description. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
