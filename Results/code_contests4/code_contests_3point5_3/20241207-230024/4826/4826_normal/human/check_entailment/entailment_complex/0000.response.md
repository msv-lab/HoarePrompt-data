Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, sorts the city coordinates, calculates the minimum distance between consecutive cities, and counts the number of times this minimum distance occurs. The final output includes the minimum distance and the count, which is exactly what the problem description requires. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
