The function `func` reads an integer `cities` from the standard input and a list of integers `coordinates` representing city coordinates. It sorts the coordinates, calculates the smallest distance `dist` between consecutive cities, and counts how many times this smallest distance occurs. Finally, it prints the smallest distance and the count. The function does not explicitly return any value.
