Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped based on the areas of its three faces with a common vertex. It follows the provided problem description for all potential cases. The logic used to calculate the edges of the parallelepiped is correct and the program produces the expected output for the given inputs. Hence, the program is correct.
