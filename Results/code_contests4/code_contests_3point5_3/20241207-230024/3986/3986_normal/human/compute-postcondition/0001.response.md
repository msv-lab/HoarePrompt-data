Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `(a / b * c) ** 0.5`. The value of `x` depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively; `x` is calculated based on these values.
