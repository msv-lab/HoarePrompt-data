Example Answer:
`z` is calculated as the square root of the ratio of `c` to the product of `a` and `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided but not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively; `y` is calculated based on these values, `z` is the square root of the ratio of `c` to the product of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively; `y` is calculated based on these values, `z` is the square root of the ratio of `c` to the product of `a` and `b`**
