Functionality: **The function `func` takes three space-separated integers as input representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped. It then calculates the square roots of the ratios of these areas and assigns them to variables x, y, and z respectively. Finally, it prints the result of 4 times the sum of x, y, and z. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
