Example Answer:
The value of `y` is calculated based on the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped represented by `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `z` is the square root of the ratio of `c` to the product of `a` and `b`. The final output is the result of the expression `4 * (x + y + z)`. 
Output State: **The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c`; `y` is calculated based on these values, `z` is the square root of the ratio of `c` to the product of `a` and `b`. The result of the expression `4 * (x + y + z)` is printed.**
