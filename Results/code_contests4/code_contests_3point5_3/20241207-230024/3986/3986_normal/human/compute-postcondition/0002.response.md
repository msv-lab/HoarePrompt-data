Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of the expression `(b / c * a) ** 0.5`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` represent the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped. After the calculation, the value of `y` is determined based on these areas. Therefore, the Output State is: The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively; `y` is calculated based on these values.
Output State: **The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively; `y` is calculated based on these values**
