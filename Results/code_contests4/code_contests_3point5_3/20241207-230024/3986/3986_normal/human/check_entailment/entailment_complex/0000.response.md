Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. It calculates the square roots of the ratios of the input areas, which is not the correct approach to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped.

The correct approach would involve finding the dimensions of the parallelepiped using the input areas and then calculating the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges. The given program does not follow this correct approach and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
