Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not fully follow the problem description for all potential cases. 
- The code calculates the square roots of the ratios of the given areas to determine the edge lengths of the parallelepiped. However, the formula used in the code to calculate the edge lengths is incorrect.
- The code assumes that the parallelepiped's edges are in the ratios calculated from the areas of the faces, which is not always the case. This results in incorrect edge lengths being calculated, leading to an incorrect sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped.
- For example, if the input areas are 1 1 1, the correct output should be 12. However, the code does not provide the correct output for this case.
