Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the lengths of the edges of the parallelepiped based on the areas of its three faces provided as input. It then sums up all the edge lengths to get the total sum of the lengths of all 12 edges, which is the required output as per the problem description. The calculations are done in a way that ensures the lengths are integers, which is necessary for a parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
