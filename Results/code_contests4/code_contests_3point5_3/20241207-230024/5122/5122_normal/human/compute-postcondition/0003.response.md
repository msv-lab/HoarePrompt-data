Example Answer:
The variable `res` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the list vs contains n integers in the range from 1 to 10^9, inclusive, minO is -1, and `res` is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the list vs contains n integers in the range from 1 to 10^9, inclusive, minO is -1, `res` is 0**
