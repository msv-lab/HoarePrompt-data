Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: n is a positive integer, and the list of n integers contains values in the range from 1 to 10^9, inclusive.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, and the list of n integers contains values in the range from 1 to 10^9, inclusive.**
