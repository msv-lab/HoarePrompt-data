Example Answer:
The value of `e` is added to `res`, where `e` is the first element in the list `vs`. Since the value of `res` is 0 initially, the value of `res` will be updated to the value of `e`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, vs has at least 1 element, e is the first element in vs, minO is -1, res is the value of e.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, vs has at least 1 element, e is the first element in vs, minO is -1, res is the value of e**
