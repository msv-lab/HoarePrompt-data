According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list vs. Since n is a positive integer, vs must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, minO is -1 and res is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, vs must have at least 1 element, and e is the first element in vs. 
State: **n is a positive integer, vs has at least 1 element, e is the first element in vs, minO is -1, res is 0**
