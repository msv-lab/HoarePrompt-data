You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, Wet Shark is given n integers. Using any of these integers no more than once, Wet Shark wants to get maximum possible even (divisible by 2) sum. Please, calculate this value for Wet Shark. 

Note, that if Wet Shark uses no integers from the n integers, the sum is an even integer 0.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). The next line contains n space separated integers given to Wet Shark. Each of these integers is in range from 1 to 109, inclusive. 

Output

Print the maximum possible even sum that can be obtained if we use some of the given integers. 

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3


Output

6

Input

5
999999999 999999999 999999999 999999999 999999999


Output

3999999996

Note

In the first sample, we can simply take all three integers for a total sum of 6.

In the second sample Wet Shark should take any four out of five integers 999 999 999.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
vs = map(int, raw_input().split())
minO = -1
res = 0
for e in vs:
    res += e
    if minO == -1 or minO > e:
        minO = e
if res % 2 == 1:
    res -= minO
print(res)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
