Correctness: False

The program does not always produce the correct output as per the problem description. For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The output should be 6, but the program will output 5. This is because the program only accounts for odd sums and subtracts the smallest odd number to make the sum even. However, in this case, the sum is already even without subtracting any number.
