Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input regarding the number of cards and the data of each card. It then creates a dictionary to keep track of the presence of each card. It iterates through the input cards and marks the corresponding position in the dictionary. Finally, it prints out the missing cards based on the priorities mentioned in the problem description.

The program follows the problem description accurately and correctly handles the input data to output the missing cards. The logic of marking the presence of cards in the dictionary and then printing out the missing ones is implemented correctly.
