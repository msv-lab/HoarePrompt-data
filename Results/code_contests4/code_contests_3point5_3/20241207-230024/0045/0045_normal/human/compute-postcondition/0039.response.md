Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `d` contains all four suits 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' with a list of 13 boolean values for each suit. `x` and `y` are assigned values from the last input split. `i` is 15. If the condition d[k][i] is true, then the function executes a specific action. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
