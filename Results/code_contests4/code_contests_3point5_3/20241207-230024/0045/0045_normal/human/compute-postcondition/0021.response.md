Output State: **`n` is greater than 0. Dictionary `d` has all four suits 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' with a list of 13 boolean values for each suit. `x` and `y` are assigned values. `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time. If the condition d[k][i] is true, the program continues with the same state. If the condition d[k][i] is false, there are no changes to the program state. The program prints the value of k and i incremented by 1.**
