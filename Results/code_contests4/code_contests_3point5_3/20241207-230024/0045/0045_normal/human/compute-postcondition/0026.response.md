Output State: **`n` is greater than 0. Dictionary `d` has all four suits 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' with a list of 13 boolean values for each suit. `x` and `y` are assigned values from the last input split. The loop will iterate through all 13 indices of the list associated with the suit 'k' in the dictionary `d`. If the boolean value at index `i` of suit 'k' is false, the program will print the values of 'k' and 'i + 1'.**
