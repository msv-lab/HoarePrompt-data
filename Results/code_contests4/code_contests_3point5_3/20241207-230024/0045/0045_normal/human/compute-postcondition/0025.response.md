Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))` prints the value of `k` and `i + 1`. The value of `k` remains the same as it is not modified in the code snippet. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before printing. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `d` has all four suits 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' with a list of 13 boolean values for each suit, `x` and `y` are assigned values, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` has all four suits 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' with a list of 13 boolean values for each suit, `x` and `y` are assigned values, `i` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time**
