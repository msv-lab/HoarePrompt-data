According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `d` has all four suits with a list of 13 boolean values for each suit, `x` and `y` are assigned values. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 so `i` should be 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, Dictionary `d` has all four suits 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' with a list of 13 boolean values for each suit, `x` and `y` are assigned values, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
