Example Answer:
Each suit in the dictionary `d` is assigned a list of 13 `None` values. The initial state only mentions `n` as an input integer, which does not affect the assignment in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, d is a dictionary where each suit 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' has a list of 13 `None` values.
Output State: **n is an input integer, d is a dictionary where each suit 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' has a list of 13 `None` values**
