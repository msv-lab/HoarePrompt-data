Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not have any impact on the program's execution. It simply skips the remaining code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` contains all four suits 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' with a list of 13 boolean values for each suit, `x` and `y` are assigned values from the last input split, `i` is 15**
