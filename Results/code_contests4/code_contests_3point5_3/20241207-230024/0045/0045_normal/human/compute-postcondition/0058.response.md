The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraints specified for the integer `n` such that 0 <= n <= 52. Each card is represented by a character and an integer, where the character represents the suit ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D') and the integer represents the rank (1 to 13). The function should perform a specific operation or return a specific output based on these constraints.
