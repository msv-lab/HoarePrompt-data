Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the condition `if __name__ == 'main':` which should be `if __name__ == '__main__':` to correctly execute the `func_1()` function. This typo causes the program to not execute the main function and thus the output will not be as expected.

Additionally, the `raw_input()` function used to take input is not valid in Python 3. The correct function to use in Python 3 would be `input()`. This will also cause the program to not function as described in the problem description.

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
