Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input of the number of cards, followed by the details of each card (suit and rank). It then creates a dictionary `d` with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' representing the four suits, each initialized with a list of 13 elements (one for each rank) set to None. 

The program then iterates over the input cards, marking the corresponding position in the dictionary `d` as True. After processing all the input cards, it then iterates over each suit and rank, checking if the card exists in the dictionary. If a card is missing (value is still None), it prints out the missing card in the required format.

This program correctly identifies and prints the missing cards according to the priority order specified in the problem description. It covers all potential cases and follows the requirements outlined in the problem description.
