The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` within the range 0 to 52 and constructs a dictionary `d` with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' mapping to lists of 13 boolean values. It then iterates `n` times, taking input for card suit and rank, and marks the corresponding position in the dictionary as True. Afterward, it iterates through all suits and ranks, printing the ones not marked as True. The function operates based on the constraints specified for the input values.
