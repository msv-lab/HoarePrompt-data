Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes input for the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces. It then calculates the minimum possible height of the tallest tower based on the given conditions. The logic used in the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers as per the problem description. The program iterates through a range of numbers and checks if the conditions are met, then prints the result. The logic appears to be correct and there are no obvious cases where the program would not work as expected.
