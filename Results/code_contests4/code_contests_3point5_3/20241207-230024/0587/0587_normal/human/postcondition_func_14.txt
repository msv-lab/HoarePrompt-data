The function `func_15` accepts non-negative integers `x` and `y` where `x + y > 0`, and a positive integer `p`. It calculates and returns the value of `res` after running a loop that updates `x` based on the conditions mentioned. The loop iterates through `y` and modifies `res` and `x` accordingly. At the end of the loop, the final value of `res` is returned. It is important to note that the function assumes `y` to be initially greater than 0, and the loop operations are performed based on the binary value of `y`.
