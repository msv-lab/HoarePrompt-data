def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from the user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 prompts the user for an integer input and returns the integer value obtained from the user input. The function assumes the user will input an integer. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the user may input a non-integer value, leading to potential issues if non-integer inputs are provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the value of the input() function, which could be any input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the value of the input provided by the user. The program assumes that the input function will always return a valid user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers obtained by splitting the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string, splits it by whitespace, converts the resulting substrings to integers, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function handles the case where the input is not provided and returns the map object as described.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the string representation of the input values after stripping and splitting them by space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, processes it by stripping and splitting the values by space, and returns a map object containing the string representation of the input values. The code operates under the assumption that there are two non-negative integers `n` and `m` such that their sum is greater than 0. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where the input values are not provided in the expected format, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by the function func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and simply returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. It relies on the assumption that `func_3` returns a list. However, there is no explicit handling of cases where `func_3` does not return a list, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size parameters, then creates and starts a new thread running the `main` function. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It is assumed that the `main` function exists elsewhere in the code and is responsible for the actual execution logic.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second element of the 'item' variable
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be an iterable, and returns the second element of the `item` variable. The function assumes `item` has at least two elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list 'l' sorted in reverse order based on the function 'getKey'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list 'l' and returns the list 'l' sorted in reverse order based on the function 'getKey'. The function assumes 'getKey' is a defined sorting key function. It does not handle cases where 'getKey' is not defined or if 'l' is not a list.

def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list with 'n' rows and 'm' columns where each element is 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_9 accepts two non-negative integers n and m such that n + m > 0, as well as a value num. It returns a 2D list with 'n' rows and 'm' columns where each element is 'num'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns the bitwise AND operation between x and the complement of x, i.e., not x & (x - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` as a parameter. It then returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and the complement of `x`, which is calculated as `not x & (x - 1)`. The function aims to determine whether `x` is a power of 2.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple of two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively.**
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns a binary representation of the tuple 'n' after removing the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a tuple of two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively. It then converts the tuple `n` into a binary representation and returns it after removing the '0b' prefix.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple of two non-negative integers where the first integer represents the number of students using two-block pieces and the second integer represents the number of students using three-block pieces.**
def func_12(n):

    #The program returns a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of students using two-block pieces and the second integer is the number of students using three-block pieces from the tuple 'n'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_12 accepts a tuple 'n' containing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces. It then converts this tuple into a list of two integers, where the first integer represents the count of students using two-block pieces and the second integer represents the count of students using three-block pieces.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
    #The program returns the result of calculating the combination of choosing r items from a set of n items, where n and r are non-negative integers such that n + r > 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, where n + r > 0. It calculates and returns the result of choosing r items from a set of n items, which represents the combination calculation. The function correctly implements the calculation of the combination as per the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that x + y > 0.**
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #The program returns the result of x divided by y using integer division
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the result of integer division of x by y, incremented by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x + y > 0`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, it returns the result of `x` divided by `y` using integer division. Otherwise, it returns the result of integer division of `x` by `y`, incremented by 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that x + y > 0, and p is a positive integer.**

        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x`, `y`, `res` are integers, `y` is 0, `x` is updated according to the conditions mentioned in the loop
    return res
    #The program returns the integer value stored in 'res' after running the loop where 'x' is updated based on the conditions mentioned. 'y' is 0 at the beginning of the program.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts non-negative integers `x` and `y` where `x + y > 0`, and a positive integer `p`. It calculates and returns the value of `res` after running a loop that updates `x` based on the conditions mentioned. The loop iterates through `y` and modifies `res` and `x` accordingly. At the end of the loop, the final value of `res` is returned. It is important to note that the function assumes `y` to be initially greater than 0, and the loop operations are performed based on the binary value of `y`.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, y is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, which is x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers x and y, such that x + y > 0, and calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the greatest common divisor, which is stored in x after the algorithm completes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple of two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively.**

        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a tuple of two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively. The number of students is greater than 1. The number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces combined is greater than 3. n is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.

    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop executes, the value of 'i' will be an integer that is greater than the square root of n. The loop control variable 'i' will not satisfy the condition 'i * i <= n' and the loop will terminate.
    return True
    #The program returns True after the loop terminates when the value of 'i' becomes an integer greater than the square root of n and no longer satisfies the condition 'i * i <= n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts a tuple `n` of two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively. It then checks various conditions based on the values in the tuple and returns True or False accordingly. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns False. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, it returns True. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns False. If none of these conditions are met, it enters a loop to check for divisibility by certain numbers and returns False if found, otherwise returns True when the loop completes without finding any divisors greater than the square root of `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` sets the standard input to read from 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to 'output.txt'. It does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value. It seems to be intended for configuring the input and output streams for processing non-negative integers `n` and `m` where `n + m > 0`. The function likely serves as a setup function for subsequent calculations or processing steps outside its scope.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_19():
    n, m = func_3()
    for i in range(1, 1000001):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, then after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be less than 500001, `m` will be less than 333334, and `n + m` will be less than 666667.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the values of non-negative integers `n` and `m` from `func_3`, and then iterates through a range up to 1000000. It checks specific conditions involving `n` and `m`. If these conditions are met, it calls `func_20(i)` and breaks out of the loop. The postcondition states that after the loop, `n` will be less than 500001, `m` will be less than 333334, and `n + m` will be less than 666667. However, the code does not explicitly return any value or indicate the final outcome based on the conditions checked during the loop. Therefore, the functionality should mention that the function performs certain operations based on the values of `n` and `m`, but it lacks a clear return value or outcome determination.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, a newline character is written to the file. If kwargs.pop('flush', False) is True, the file is flushed. Otherwise, no change occurs in the program state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_20 does not accept any parameters. It attempts to unpack kwargs dictionary which is not provided as a parameter. It then iterates over args but args is not defined in the function leading to a NameError. The function tries to write the values of args to sys.stdout separated by ' ', ending with a newline character. If flush is True in kwargs, it flushes the file. However, the code will not run as intended due to missing arguments and variables.
