The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, processes it by stripping and splitting the values by space, and returns a map object containing the string representation of the input values. The code operates under the assumption that there are two non-negative integers `n` and `m` such that their sum is greater than 0. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where the input values are not provided in the expected format, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
