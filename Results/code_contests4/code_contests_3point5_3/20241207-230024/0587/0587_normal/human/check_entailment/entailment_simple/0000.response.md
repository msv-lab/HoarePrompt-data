Correctness: **True**

The annotated program contains functions that can handle user input, manipulate data structures, perform mathematical calculations, and control program flow. The functions are designed to process the input values of 'n' and 'm' (representing the number of students using two-block and three-block pieces) and determine the minimum possible height of the tallest tower, as required by the problem description.

The program uses various functions to extract, process, and calculate the necessary values to find the minimum height of the tallest tower. It handles different cases and scenarios where the input values of 'n' and 'm' can vary, ensuring that the final output is the correct answer based on the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all possible cases.
