The function `func_18` sets the standard input to read from 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to 'output.txt'. It does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value. It seems to be intended for configuring the input and output streams for processing non-negative integers `n` and `m` where `n + m > 0`. The function likely serves as a setup function for subsequent calculations or processing steps outside its scope.
