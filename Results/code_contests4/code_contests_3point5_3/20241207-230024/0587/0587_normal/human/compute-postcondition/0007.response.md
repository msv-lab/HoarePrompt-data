Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string using `str(x)` and then written to the file. The `file` variable is `sys.stdout`, so the value of `x` will be displayed on the console. The other variables `n`, `m`, `sep`, and `at_start` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is either True or False.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is either True or False**
