Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The previous values of the variables are `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` list must have more elements. After the execution, the file will have a space character written. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` list must have more elements, space character is written to the file.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` list must have more elements, space character is written to the file**
