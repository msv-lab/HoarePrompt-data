Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the `file`. The value of `sep` is ' '. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` list must have more elements.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` list must have more elements**
