According to the code, the loop can execute if the `args` list has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, the variables `n` and `m` being non-negative integers do not directly affect the loop execution. The variables `sep` being ' ', `file` being sys.stdout, and `at_start` being True also do not directly affect the loop execution.
So, for the loop to execute, `args` list must have at least 1 element.
State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least 1 element**
