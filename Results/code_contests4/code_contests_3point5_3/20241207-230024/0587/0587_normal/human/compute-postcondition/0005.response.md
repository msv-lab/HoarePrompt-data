Example Answer: 
The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the file specified in `file`. Since `sep` is a space character, the output will be a space written to the file. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least 1 element.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least 1 element**
