Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file. No variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False. If `at_start` is False, then the loop will execute one more time only if the `args` list has more elements.
