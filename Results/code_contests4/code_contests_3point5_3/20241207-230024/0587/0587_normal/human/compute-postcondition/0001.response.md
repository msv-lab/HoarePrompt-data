Example Answer: 
The code snippet assigns the value associated with the 'sep' key from the kwargs dictionary to the variable 'sep' and assigns the value associated with the 'file' key from the kwargs dictionary to the variable 'file'. If the keys 'sep' and 'file' are not present in the kwargs dictionary, the default values ' ' (space) and sys.stdout are used respectively. Since the initial state does not mention the presence of a kwargs dictionary, the output state will be as follows:
Output State: **n and m are non-negative integers, sep is ' ' (space), file is sys.stdout**
