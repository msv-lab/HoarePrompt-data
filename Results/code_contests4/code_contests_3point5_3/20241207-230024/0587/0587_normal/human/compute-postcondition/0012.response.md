Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` list must have more elements. If not at the start, a space character is written to the file.
