Example Answer: 
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`, which means the program is starting at a specific point. The values of other variables are not affected based on the given initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True**
