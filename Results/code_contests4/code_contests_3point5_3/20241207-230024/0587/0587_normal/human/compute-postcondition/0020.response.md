Example Answer:
The `write` method of the file object `file` writes the end keyword argument value or '\n' if not provided. The `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` call removes the 'end' key from the `kwargs` dictionary if present, otherwise it returns '\n'. Since `end` is not provided in the initial state, '\n' is written to the file. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False and a newline character is written to the file.**
