Example Answer:
The `flush` method is called on the file object, which ensures that any buffered data is written to the file. Since the 'flush' key is popped from kwargs and its value is True, the file will be flushed. Other variables and states remain the same.
Output State: **n and m are non-negative integers, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False, a newline character is written to the file**
