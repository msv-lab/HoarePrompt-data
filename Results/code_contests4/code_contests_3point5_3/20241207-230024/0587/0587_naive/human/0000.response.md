Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum possible height of the tallest tower based on the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces. It iterates through all possible tower heights and checks if it satisfies the condition that no two students' towers may contain the same number of blocks. The program correctly handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for each input scenario.
