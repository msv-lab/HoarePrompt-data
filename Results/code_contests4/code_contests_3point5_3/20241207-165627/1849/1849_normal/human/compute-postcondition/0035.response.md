Postcondition: ***`s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping with at least 1 character. If `i` is '(', `left` is decremented by 2, `right` is decremented by `ans[p]` (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)), `sh` remains the same, `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, and `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is not '(', `left` is decremented by 1, `right` is further decremented by 1 or `ans[p]` (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1) based on the condition, `sh` remains the same, `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, `i` is the next character in `s`, and `right` is further decremented by `ans[p]` if the condition is met.***
