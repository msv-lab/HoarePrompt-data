Output State: **`s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping with at least 1 character, `left` is decremented by 1, `right` is decremented by `ans[p] (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)), `sh` is not incremented, `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, and `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is equal to '(', `right` is decreased by 1. If `i` is not equal to '(', `left` is also decremented by `ans[p] (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)), `right` is decremented by `ans[p] (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1). `print(-1)` is executed, but it does not affect any variable values.**
