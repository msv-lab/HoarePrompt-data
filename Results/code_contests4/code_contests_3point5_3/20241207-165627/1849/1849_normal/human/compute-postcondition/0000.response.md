Example Answer:
The lambda function rstr is defined to read a line from the standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespace characters. The initial state is s is a string of length at least 1, consisting of characters '(', ')' or '#'. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string of length at least 1, consisting of characters '(', ')' or '#'; rstr is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips leading or trailing whitespace.
Output State: **s is a string of length at least 1, consisting of characters '(', ')' or '#'; rstr is a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and strips leading or trailing whitespace.**
