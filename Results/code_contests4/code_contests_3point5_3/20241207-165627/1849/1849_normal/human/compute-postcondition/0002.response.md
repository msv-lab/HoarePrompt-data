Example Answer: 
`left` is assigned the count of '(' in the string `s`, `right` is assigned the count of ')' in the string `s`, and `sh` is assigned the count of '#' in the string `s`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `sh` are calculated based on the input string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping, `left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#'.
Output State: **`s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping, `left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#'**
