Example Answer: 
The value of `right` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `right` is unknown, but after decrementing, `right` is decreased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping with at least 1 character, `left` and `right` are decremented by `ans[p] (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)), `sh` is not incremented, `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, and `i` is the next character in `s`, `right` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping with at least 1 character, `left` and `right` are decremented by `ans[p] (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)), `sh` is not incremented, `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, and `i` is the next character in `s`, `right` is decreased by 1**
