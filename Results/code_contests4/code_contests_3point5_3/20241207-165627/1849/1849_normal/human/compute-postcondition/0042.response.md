Functionality: **The function takes an input string `s` containing characters '(', ')', or '#' and performs certain operations based on the counts of these characters. It calculates and adjusts the values of `left`, `right`, `sh`, `ans`, `p`, `j`, and `i` within a loop. If at any point during the loop `right` becomes greater than `left`, it prints -1 and exits. The final values of `ans` are printed. The function does not return any value.**
