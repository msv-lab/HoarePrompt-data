Example Answer:
`left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping with at least 1 character, `left` is decremented by 1, `right` is decremented by `ans[p] (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)), `sh` is not incremented, `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, and `i` is the next character in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping with at least 1 character, `left` is decremented by 1, `right` is decremented by `ans[p] (1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)), `sh` is not incremented, `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, and `i` is the next character in `s`**
