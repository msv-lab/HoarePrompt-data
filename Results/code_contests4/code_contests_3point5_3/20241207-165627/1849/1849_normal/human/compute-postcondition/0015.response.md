Postcondition: ***`s` is a string obtained from input after whitespace stripping with at least 1 character, `left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list with elements [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is the first character in `s`. If `i` is equal to '(', `left` is decreased by 1. If `i` is equal to ')', `left` and `right` are decremented by 1, `sh` is not incremented, `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` remains 0, `j` remains 0, and `i` is not equal to '('. If `i` is equal to ')' or '(', `left` and `right` are decremented by 1, `sh` is not incremented, and `ans` remains [1, 1, abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, and `i` is not equal to '(' and `i` is not equal to ')'; `p` is incremented by 1. If `(right > left)`, then `right` is greater than `left`.***
