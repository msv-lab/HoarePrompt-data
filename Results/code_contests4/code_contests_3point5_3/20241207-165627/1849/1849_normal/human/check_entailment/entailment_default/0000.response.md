Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The program should output the number of ')' characters each '#' character must be replaced with in order to create a beautiful string. However, the code does not handle the case when it is not possible to create a beautiful string. 

For example, if the input string is `(#)` the code should output `-1` because it is not possible to replace '#' with ')' to create a beautiful string. But the code does not handle this case correctly and may give incorrect results. Thus, the code is not correct as it does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
