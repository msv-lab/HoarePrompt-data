Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes an input string `s` containing characters '(', ')', and '#', then calculates the number of '('s, ')'s, and '#'s in the string. It then replaces each '#' character based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description to ensure that the final string is beautiful.

The program iterates through the characters of the input string, updating the counts of '(' and ')' characters based on the current character. It then calculates the number of ')' characters needed to replace each '#' character to make the string beautiful. If at any point the number of ')' characters exceeds the number of '(' characters, it prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, it prints the required number of ')' characters for each '#' character.

The program handles different cases where the input string can be converted into a beautiful string by replacing '#' characters with ')' characters, meeting all the conditions specified in the problem description.
