Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
I have analyzed the provided Python program and tested it with multiple test cases based on the problem description. The program correctly solves the problem as it replaces each '#' character with the required number of ')' characters to make the string beautiful. The program ensures that there are no more ')' characters than '(' characters among the first i characters of the string and the total number of '(' characters is equal to the total number of ')' characters. The output is as expected for all the test cases I have considered. Hence, the program is correct.
