Example Answer: 
The string `s` is modified by shifting characters based on the index `ss`. The substring from index `ss` to the end of `s` is concatenated with the substring from the beginning of `s` to index `ss`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000; `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n - 1 and all elements are distinct; `f` is a modified string after replacing ' 0 ' with ' ', `ff` is a character extracted from `f`, `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000; `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n - 1 and all elements are distinct; `f` is a modified string after replacing ' 0 ' with ' ', `ff` is a character extracted from `f`, `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in `s**
