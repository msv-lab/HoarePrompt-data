Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000; `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n - 1 and all elements are distinct; `f` is a modified string after replacing ' 0 ' with ' ', `ff` is a character extracted from `f`, `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in `s; The strings `s` and `f` are not equal, therefore the program did not enter the if block and instead entered the else block. The output state is: 'NO' is printed.**
