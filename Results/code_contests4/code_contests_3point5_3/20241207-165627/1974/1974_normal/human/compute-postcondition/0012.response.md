Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000; `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n - 1 and all elements are distinct; `f` is a modified string after replacing ' 0 ' with ' ', `ff` is a character extracted from `f`, `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in `s. If `s` is equal to `f`, the program does nothing. If `s` is not equal to `f`, the program prints 'NO'.***
