Example Answer: 
`f` is assigned the value ' ' + raw_input() + ' ', where raw_input() accepts an input and adds spaces before and after the input. The variables n, ai, and bi are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000; ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n - 1 and all elements are distinct.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000; ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n - 1 and all elements are distinct.**
