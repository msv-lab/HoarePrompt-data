Example Answer:
The index of the first occurrence of character `ff` in string `s` is assigned to `ss`. The values of `n`, `ai`, `bi`, `f`, and `ff` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000; ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n - 1 and all elements are distinct; f is a modified string after replacing ' 0 ' with ' ', ff is a character extracted from f, ss is the index of the first occurrence of ff in s.
