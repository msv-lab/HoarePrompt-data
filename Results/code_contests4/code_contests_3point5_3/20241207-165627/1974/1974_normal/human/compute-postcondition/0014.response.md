Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n`, two lists of integers `ai` and `bi` of length `n`, and performs a series of string manipulations on input strings `f` and `s`. It then checks if the modified `s` is equal to `f` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any specific value. **

Note: The code does perform the string manipulations as described in the annotations, but it's important to note that it does not explicitly handle cases where the input constraints are not met (e.g., if the input does not follow the specified format).
