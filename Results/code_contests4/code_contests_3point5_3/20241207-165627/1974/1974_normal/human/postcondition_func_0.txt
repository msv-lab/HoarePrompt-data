The function `func` reads an integer `n`, two lists of integers `ai` and `bi` of length `n`, and performs a series of string manipulations on input strings `f` and `s`. It then checks if the modified `s` is equal to `f` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any specific value.
