You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A remote island chain contains n islands, labeled 1 through n. Bidirectional bridges connect the islands to form a simple cycle — a bridge connects islands 1 and 2, islands 2 and 3, and so on, and additionally a bridge connects islands n and 1. The center of each island contains an identical pedestal, and all but one of the islands has a fragile, uniquely colored statue currently held on the pedestal. The remaining island holds only an empty pedestal.

The islanders want to rearrange the statues in a new order. To do this, they repeat the following process: First, they choose an island directly adjacent to the island containing an empty pedestal. Then, they painstakingly carry the statue on this island across the adjoining bridge and place it on the empty pedestal.

Determine if it is possible for the islanders to arrange the statues in the desired order.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the total number of islands.

The second line contains n space-separated integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1) — the statue currently placed on the i-th island. If ai = 0, then the island has no statue. It is guaranteed that the ai are distinct.

The third line contains n space-separated integers bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ n - 1) — the desired statues of the ith island. Once again, bi = 0 indicates the island desires no statue. It is guaranteed that the bi are distinct.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if the rearrangement can be done in the existing network, and "NO" otherwise.

Examples

3
1 0 2
2 0 1


Output

YES

Output

YES


Input

4
1 2 3 0
0 3 2 1


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the islanders can first move statue 1 from island 1 to island 2, then move statue 2 from island 3 to island 1, and finally move statue 1 from island 2 to island 3.

In the second sample, the islanders can simply move statue 1 from island 1 to island 2.

In the third sample, no sequence of movements results in the desired position.
