Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input, manipulates the strings representing the current and desired statues on each island, and then checks if the rearrangement can be done. The program outputs "YES" if the rearrangement is possible and "NO" otherwise, which is consistent with the problem description. The program handles all cases where the rearrangement can or cannot be done based on the initial and desired statues on the islands.
