Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input values for the number of islands, the current statues on each island, and the desired statues on each island.
- It then manipulates the input strings to remove any instances of '0' (empty pedestal) to simplify the comparison.
- It then rearranges the desired statues to match the position of the first current statue.
- Finally, it checks if the rearranged desired statues match the current statues and prints "YES" if they do, and "NO" otherwise.
- The code works correctly for all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately. The output hints also align with the code's functionality.
