Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, the program seems to correctly determine if the rearrangement can be done in the existing network. The code first reads the input values for the current and desired statues on each island. It then processes the input to handle cases where an island has no statue (represented by 0). The code then checks if the rearrangement can be done by moving the statues according to the rules provided in the problem description. Finally, it prints "YES" if the rearrangement can be done, and "NO" otherwise.

The code handles the given problem correctly by simulating the movement of statues between islands until the desired order is achieved. The logic used in the code aligns with the rules and constraints mentioned in the problem description. The provided examples also cover different scenarios to validate the correctness of the code.
