Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the current and desired statues on each island and checks if it is possible to rearrange the statues according to the rules provided in the problem description. The code iterates through the islands and rearranges the statues accordingly, checking if the final arrangement matches the desired arrangement. The logic of moving statues from one island to another is correctly implemented, and the code outputs "YES" if it is possible to rearrange the statues, and "NO" otherwise. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
