The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`. It then iterates through a list of coordinates, calculates distances, and updates the value of `v` based on certain conditions. After the loop, it checks a specific condition and may update `v` again. Finally, it prints 'Poor Inna and pony!' followed by the value of `v` if it is less than 1 shifted left by 55 bits. The function does not return any value.
