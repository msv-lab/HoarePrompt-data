You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Dima and Inna are doing so great! At the moment, Inna is sitting on the magic lawn playing with a pink pony. Dima wanted to play too. He brought an n × m chessboard, a very tasty candy and two numbers a and b.

Dima put the chessboard in front of Inna and placed the candy in position (i, j) on the board. The boy said he would give the candy if it reaches one of the corner cells of the board. He's got one more condition. There can only be actions of the following types:

  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y - b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y - b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y + b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y + b). 



Naturally, Dima doesn't allow to move the candy beyond the chessboard borders.

Inna and the pony started shifting the candy around the board. They wonder what is the minimum number of allowed actions that they need to perform to move the candy from the initial position (i, j) to one of the chessboard corners. Help them cope with the task! 

Input

The first line of the input contains six integers n, m, i, j, a, b (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 106; 1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ j ≤ m; 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. Position (i, j) in the statement is a chessboard cell on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. You can consider that the corners are: (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1).

Output

In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy.

If Inna and the pony cannot get the candy playing by Dima's rules, print on a single line "Poor Inna and pony!" without the quotes.

Examples

Input

5 7 1 3 2 2


Output

2


Input

5 5 2 3 1 1


Output

Poor Inna and pony!

Note

Note to sample 1:

Inna and the pony can move the candy to position (1 + 2, 3 + 2) = (3, 5), from there they can move it to positions (3 - 2, 5 + 2) = (1, 7) and (3 + 2, 5 + 2) = (5, 7). These positions correspond to the corner squares of the chess board. Thus, the answer to the test sample equals two.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, i, j, a, b are all integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.**
def func():
    n, m, x, y, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    v = 1 << 60
    for c in [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]:
        dx = abs(x - c[0])
        
        dy = abs(y - c[1])
        
        if 0 == dx + dy:
            v = 0
        elif dx % a == 0 and dy % b == 0 and dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2:
            v = min(v, max(dx / a, dy / b))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` maintain their original values inputted by the user, and `v` may have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. The final value of `v` depends on the calculations performed in each iteration of the loop.
    if (v and (max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b)) :
        v = 1 << 60
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` maintain their original values inputted by the user. `v` may have been updated based on the conditions within the loop, and its final value depends on the calculations performed in each iteration of the loop. Upon entering the if condition, `v` is true and `(max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b)` is true. `v` is then assigned the value 1 shifted left by 60 bits.
    print('Poor Inna and pony!', v)[v < 1 << 55]

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
