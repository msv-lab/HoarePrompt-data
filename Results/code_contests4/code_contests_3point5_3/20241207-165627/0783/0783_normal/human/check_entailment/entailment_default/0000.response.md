Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`.
- It then iterates through a list of corner coordinates and calculates the distances `dx` and `dy` between the current position `(x, y)` and the corner.
- If the candy is already at one of the corner cells, the number of moves required is 0, which is correctly handled by setting `v` to 0.
- The code then checks if it is possible to move the candy to a corner cell within the given constraints using the allowed actions. If it is possible, it calculates the minimum number of moves required and updates the value of `v` accordingly.
- Finally, it checks if the candy cannot be moved within the constraints and updates `v` to a large value if needed.
- The code correctly prints the minimum number of moves required to get the candy to a corner cell or "Poor Inna and pony!" if it is not possible to do so.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, along with the provided examples, it can be concluded that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases.
