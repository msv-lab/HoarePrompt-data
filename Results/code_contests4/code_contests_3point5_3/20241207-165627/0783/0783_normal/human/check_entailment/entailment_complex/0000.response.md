Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input values for the chessboard dimensions, initial position of the candy, and the movement steps allowed. It then iterates through the corner coordinates of the chessboard, calculates the distances between the candy position and the corners, and updates the minimum number of moves required to reach a corner based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

After the loop, the program checks if the candy can reach a corner based on the constraints of the chessboard size and the movement steps allowed. If the candy cannot reach a corner, it outputs "Poor Inna and pony!". Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of moves required to reach a corner.

The program follows the problem description and correctly determines the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy to one of the corners of the chessboard.
