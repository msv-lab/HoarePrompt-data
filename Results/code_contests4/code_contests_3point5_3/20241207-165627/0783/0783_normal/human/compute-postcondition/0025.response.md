Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `v` may have been modified based on the conditions in the previous iteration. `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and the first element of list `c`, and `dy` is the absolute difference between `y` and the second element of list `c`. If `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and both the quotients of dividing `dx` by `a` and `dy` by `b` have the same parity, then the program will execute the if block. Otherwise, the else block will be executed.***
