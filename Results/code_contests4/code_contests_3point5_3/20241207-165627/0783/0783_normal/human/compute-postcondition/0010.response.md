Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are valid integers. The sum of `dx` and `dy` is not equal to 0. `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and both `dx/a` and `dy/b` have the same parity. The value of `v` is updated to the minimum value between the current `v` and the maximum value between `dx / a` and `dy / b`.***
