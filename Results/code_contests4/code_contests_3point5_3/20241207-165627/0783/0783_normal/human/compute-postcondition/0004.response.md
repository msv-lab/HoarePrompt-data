Example Answer:
`dy` is assigned the absolute difference between the values of `y` and the second element of list `c`. The values of `y` and `c` are not provided, so the exact value of `dy` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned valid integer values for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned valid integer values for the loop to execute**
