According to the code, the loop will iterate over the list of tuples [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]. To ensure the loop executes, the variables `n` and `m` need to have valid integer values, and `v` being a very large integer value does not affect the loop execution. Before the loop starts, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` do not play a role in determining whether the loop will execute.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned valid integer values for the loop to execute**
