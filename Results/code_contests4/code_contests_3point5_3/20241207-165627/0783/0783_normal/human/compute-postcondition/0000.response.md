Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are assigned values parsed from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the initial states of these variables are unknown, the output state after execution will be: n, m, x, y, a, and b are assigned new integer values from user input.
Output State: **n, m, x, y, a, and b are assigned new integer values from user input**
