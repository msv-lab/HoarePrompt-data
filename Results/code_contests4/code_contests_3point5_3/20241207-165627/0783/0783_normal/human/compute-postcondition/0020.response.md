Example Answer:
`dx` is assigned the absolute difference between the value of `x` and the first element of list `c`. The previous values of the variables `x` and `c` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `v` may have been modified based on the conditions in the previous iteration, `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and the first element of list `c`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `v` may have been modified based on the conditions in the previous iteration, `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and the first element of list `c`**
