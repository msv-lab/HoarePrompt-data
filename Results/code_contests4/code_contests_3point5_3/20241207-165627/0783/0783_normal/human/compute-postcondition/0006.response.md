Example Answer:
The variable `v` is assigned the value 0. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned valid integer values for the loop to execute. The sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0, `v` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned valid integer values for the loop to execute. The sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0, `v` is 0**
