Example Answer:
`dy` is assigned the absolute difference between `y` and the second element of the list `c`. As the initial state does not provide the values of `y` and `c`, the exact value of `dy` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are valid integers.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are valid integers**
