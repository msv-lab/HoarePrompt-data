Example Answer:
`dx` is assigned the absolute difference between `x` and the first element of list `c`. The values of `x` and `c[0]` are unknown, so the exact value of `dx` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned valid integer values for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned valid integer values for the loop to execute**
