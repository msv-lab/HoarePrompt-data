According to the code, the loop iterates through a list of tuples where each tuple represents a pair of values. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `v` may or may not have been modified based on the conditions provided. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `n` and `m` are modified during the previous iteration, their values need to be considered for the next iteration.
- If `v` is set to 0 due to the condition `0 == dx + dy`, then `v` remains 0 for the next iteration.
- If the condition `dx % a == 0 and dy % b == 0 and (dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2)` is met and `v` is updated, the updated value of `v` must be considered for the next iteration.
- If none of the above conditions are met, there is no change in the values of `n`, `m`, and `v`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `v` may have been modified based on the conditions in the previous iteration. These modified values need to be considered for the next iteration.**
