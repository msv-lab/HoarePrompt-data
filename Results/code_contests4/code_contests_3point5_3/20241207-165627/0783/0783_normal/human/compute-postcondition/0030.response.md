Example Answer:
Since the condition `[v < 1 << 55]` evaluates to true, the value of `v` is printed along with the statement 'Poor Inna and pony!'. The value of `v` is updated to `1 << 60`. The original values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as inputted by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: *After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` maintain their original values; `v` is updated to `1 << 60`.
Output State: ** *After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` maintain their original values; `v` is updated to `1 << 60**
