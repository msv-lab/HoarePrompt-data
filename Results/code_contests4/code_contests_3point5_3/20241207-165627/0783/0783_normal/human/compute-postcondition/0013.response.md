Example Answer:
`dx` is assigned the absolute difference between the values of `x` and `c[0]`. Since the initial state does not provide the values of `x` or `c[0]`, we cannot calculate the specific value of `dx`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are valid integers.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are valid integers**
