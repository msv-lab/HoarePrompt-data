Example Answer:
`v` is assigned the minimum value between the current value of `v` and the maximum value between `dx / a` and `dy / b`. Since `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, the values of `dx / a` and `dy / b` will be integers. Also, both `dx / a` and `dy / b` have the same parity, meaning they are either both even or both odd. Therefore, the maximum value between them will also be an integer. The minimum value between `v` and this integer is then assigned to `v`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned valid integer values for the loop to execute. The sum of `dx` and `dy` is not equal to 0. `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and both `dx/a` and `dy/b` have the same parity (even or odd). `v` is updated to the minimum value between the current `v` and the maximum value between `dx / a` and `dy / b`.**
