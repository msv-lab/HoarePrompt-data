Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` maintain their original values inputted by the user. `v` may have been updated based on the conditions within the loop, and its final value depends on the calculations performed in each iteration of the loop. Upon entering the if condition, `v` is true and `(max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b)` is true. `v` is then assigned the value 1 shifted left by 60 bits.***
