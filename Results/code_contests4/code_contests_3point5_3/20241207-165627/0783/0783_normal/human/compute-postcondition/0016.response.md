Example Answer:
The value of `v` is assigned the minimum value between `v` and the maximum value between `dx / a` and `dy / b`. The variables `dx`, `dy`, `a`, and `b` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `v`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are valid integers, `v` is updated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are valid integers, `v` is updated based on the given formula**
