Example Answer: 
The variable `v` is assigned the value of 1 left-shifted by 60 positions. This means `v` will have a very large value. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are assigned new integer values from user input; `v` is a very large integer value.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are assigned new integer values from user input; `v` is a very large integer value**
