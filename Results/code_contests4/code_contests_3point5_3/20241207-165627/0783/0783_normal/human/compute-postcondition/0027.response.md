Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` maintain their original values inputted by the user. `v` may have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. The final value of `v` depends on the calculations performed in each iteration of the loop. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `v` is true and `(max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b)` is true***
