Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly follows the problem description and considers all possible cases for moving the candy to one of the corner cells of the chessboard. It calculates the minimum number of moves needed and handles the condition where Inna and the pony cannot reach the corner cells. The code checks multiple scenarios for each corner cell and calculates the minimum moves accordingly. Additionally, it handles the case where the candy cannot be moved within the chessboard borders. Therefore, the code is correct in all potential cases.
