Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking all possible corner cells on the chessboard and calculating the minimum number of moves needed to reach any of them. The program also correctly handles the case where Inna and the pony cannot get the candy to any corner cell and outputs "Poor Inna and pony!". The logic for calculating the minimum number of moves is implemented correctly. Overall, the program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
