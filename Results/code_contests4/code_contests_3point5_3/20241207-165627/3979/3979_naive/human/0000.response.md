Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The function `func_1` is not implemented correctly to handle negative numbers. The division operation should be replaced with integer division `//` to ensure correct output. Additionally, the program only considers the absolute difference between the coordinates, which may not always lead to the minimum number of bad cells visited. 

For example, for the input:
2 2 1 0 0 1

The expected output is 1, but the program outputs 0. This is because the program does not consider the path that minimizes the number of bad cells visited.
