Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not align with the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit to travel from one square to another, but the function does not implement this logic. Instead, it simply performs a division operation on the input parameters and returns the result.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
