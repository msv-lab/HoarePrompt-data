Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not address the problem description at all. The function `func_1` takes two arguments `c` and `d`, performs a division operation, and returns the result. This is completely unrelated to the problem description which requires finding the minimum number of bad cells to visit on the way from one square to another based on specific conditions.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
