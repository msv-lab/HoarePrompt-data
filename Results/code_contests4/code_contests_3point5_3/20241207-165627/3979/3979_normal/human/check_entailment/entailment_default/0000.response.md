Correctness: **True**

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems that the code accurately implements the logic required to find the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit on the way from (x1; y1) to (x2; y2). The code calculates the distances between the coordinates and the nearest bad cell based on the given conditions. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to return the division of `c` by `d`.

Additionally, examining the examples provided in the problem description, the code produces the correct outputs for those cases as well. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints do not raise any issues with the implementation, we can conclude that the code is correct.
