The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `c` and `d`. The parameters `c` and `d` are integers such that 2 <= a, b <= 109. The function has two cases:

Case_1: The program returns the division of integer `c` by an unknown variable `d`.
Case_2: The program returns the result of dividing integer `c` by integer `d`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integer parameters `c` and `d`, and based on the case, it either returns the division of `c` by an unknown variable `d` or the result of dividing `c` by `d`.
