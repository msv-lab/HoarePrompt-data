Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of bad cells that one will have to visit in order to travel from square (x1; y1) to square (x2; y2) as described in the problem statement.

The function `func_1` is not correctly handling division in Python 3. In Python 3, the `/` operator performs true division and returns a float, whereas in Python 2 it performs integer division. So the calculation inside `func_1` should be changed to use `//` for integer division.

Additionally, the logic to calculate `ans1` and `ans2` is incorrect. The program should consider the number of bad cells between the starting and ending points, not just the difference between the starting and ending points.

Therefore, the code needs to be revised to correctly calculate the minimum number of bad cells that need to be visited.
