Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the `func_2` function, which is supposed to calculate the sum of all elements at the end of the process. However, the `func_2` function is defined but not called anywhere in the program. Therefore, the program does not produce the correct output as per the problem description.

Additionally, there are unnecessary parts in the program related to input/output handling that are not relevant to the problem at hand.
