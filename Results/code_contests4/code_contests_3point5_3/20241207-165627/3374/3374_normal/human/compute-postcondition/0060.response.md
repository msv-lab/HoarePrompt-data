According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is updated by floor dividing it by `x`, which means `ai` has changed. For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` needs to satisfy the condition that `ai % x == 0`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is updated by floor dividing it by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again, `ai % x == 0`**
