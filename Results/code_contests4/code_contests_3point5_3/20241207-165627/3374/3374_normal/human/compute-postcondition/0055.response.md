The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in the list, `cnt` is 1**
