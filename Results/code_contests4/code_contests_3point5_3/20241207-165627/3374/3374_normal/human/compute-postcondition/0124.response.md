Example Answer:
`pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` represents the number of times `ai` can be divided by `x` without a remainder. Since `ai` is not divisible by `x` anymore, the value of `cnt` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is the number of times `ai` can be divided by `x` without a remainder, `ai` is not divisible by `x` anymore, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`.
Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `ai` can be divided by `x` without a remainder, `ai` is not divisible by `x` anymore, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`**
