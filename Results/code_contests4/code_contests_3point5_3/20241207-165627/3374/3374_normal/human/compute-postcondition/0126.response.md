Example Answer:
`cnt` is assigned the value 0. The value of `cnt` is now 0. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is 0, `ai` is not divisible by `x` anymore, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there is at least one more element in the list `a`.
Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `ai` is not divisible by `x` anymore, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there is at least one more element in the list `a`**
