Example Answer:
`cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is 1, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there is at least one more element in the list `a` for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there is at least one more element in the list `a` for the loop to execute the first time**
