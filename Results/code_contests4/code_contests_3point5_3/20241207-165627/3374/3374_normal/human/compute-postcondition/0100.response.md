Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` are assigned new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in list `a`, `cnt` is initialized to 0**
