According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ai` and `x`. If `ai % x == 0`, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is 1. To ensure the loop executes at least once, specific values need to be provided for `ai` and `x` such that `ai % x == 0` is true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is 1, specific values for `ai` and `x` need to be provided for the loop to execute**
