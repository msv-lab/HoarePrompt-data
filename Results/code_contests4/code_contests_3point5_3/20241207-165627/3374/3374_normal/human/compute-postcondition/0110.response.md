Output State: **If `ai` is divisible by `x` for all elements in list `a`, then `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` can be divided by `x`, `ai` is the result of the last division operation, `i` is the index of the last element processed in list `a`. If `ai` is not divisible by `x` for any element in list `a`, then `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the last processed element value, `i` is the index of the last processed element in list `a`.**
