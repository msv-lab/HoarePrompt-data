According to the code, the loop can execute again if `ai % x` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been updated, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect the updated value. Additionally, `i` should be less than the length of list `a` for the loop to execute the first time. `cnt` needs to be updated to reflect the number of times the loop has executed.
State: **`t` remains the same, `n`, `x`, `a`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the next index, `ai` is the updated value after division by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is updated, `ai` is updated, for the loop to execute the first time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `cnt` is updated to reflect the number of times the loop has executed**
