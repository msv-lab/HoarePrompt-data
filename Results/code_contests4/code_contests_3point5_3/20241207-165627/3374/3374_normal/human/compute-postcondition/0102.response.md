Example Answer:
`cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` have new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, for the loop to execute the first time `ai` is divisible by `x` and `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `cnt` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` have new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, for the loop to execute the first time `ai` is divisible by `x` and `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `cnt` is increased by 1**
