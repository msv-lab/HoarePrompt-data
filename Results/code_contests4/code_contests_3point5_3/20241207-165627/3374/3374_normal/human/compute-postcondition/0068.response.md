Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is 1, `pow_x[i]` is updated to 0, for the loop to execute the first time, `ai` must be divisible by `x`**
