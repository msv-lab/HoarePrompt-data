Example Answer:
`ai` is updated by performing integer division by `x`, where the new value of `ai` will be divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again. The value of `cnt` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x` and is divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x` and is divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again**
