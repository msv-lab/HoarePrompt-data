Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, so after execution, `cnt` is updated to reflect the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` remains the same, `n`, `x`, `a`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the next index, `ai` is the next element in the list `a` and divisible by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is updated, `ai` is updated, for the loop to execute the first time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `cnt` is updated to reflect the number of times the loop has executed.
Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n`, `x`, `a`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the next index, `ai` is the next element in the list `a` and divisible by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is updated, `ai` is updated, for the loop to execute the first time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `cnt` is updated to reflect the number of times the loop has executed**
