According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai` being divisible by `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so the next element in the list `a` to be considered is `a[3]`. To execute the loop one more time, `a[3]` should be divisible by `x`. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, we can assume that `ai` will be updated to the next element in the list for the next iteration. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 4, `cnt` is 2**
