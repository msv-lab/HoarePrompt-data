Example Answer: 
A list `pow_x` of length `n` is created with all elements initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` are updated based on new input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` are assigned new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` are assigned new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same**
