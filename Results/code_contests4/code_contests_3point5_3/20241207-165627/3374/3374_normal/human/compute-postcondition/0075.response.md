Example Answer:
`ai` is divided by `x`. Since `ai % x == 0`, `ai` is divisible by `x`, the value of `ai` will be updated accordingly. The rest of the initial variables remain the same.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is updated to the next index, `cnt` is increased by 1, updated `ai` value, `cnt` is increased by 1**
