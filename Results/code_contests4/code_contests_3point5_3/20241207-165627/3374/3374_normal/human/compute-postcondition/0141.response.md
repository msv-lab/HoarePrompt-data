Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with the argument `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` are updated from input. Other variables remain the same. The function calculates a new value based on the input arguments. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, and `x` are assigned new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, and `x` are assigned new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`**
