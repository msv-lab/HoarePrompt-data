According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. If the condition is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been updated by floor dividing it by `x`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `ai` should still satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, for the loop to execute again `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in the list, `cnt` is 1, `ai` has been updated by floor dividing it by `x`**
