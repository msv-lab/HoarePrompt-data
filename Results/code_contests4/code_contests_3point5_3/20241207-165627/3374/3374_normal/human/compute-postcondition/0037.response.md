Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2, for the loop to execute the next time, the next element in `a` after `ai` must be divisible by `x` and `pow_x[i]` needs to be updated**
