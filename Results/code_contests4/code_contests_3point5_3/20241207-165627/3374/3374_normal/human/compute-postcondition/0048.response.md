According to the code, the loop can execute `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with the total number of times each element in `a` was divisible by `x` before becoming indivisible, `min_pow` is the minimum value in the list `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` should be decremented by 1 and all other values should remain the same.
State: **`t` is one less than the previous value, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same**
