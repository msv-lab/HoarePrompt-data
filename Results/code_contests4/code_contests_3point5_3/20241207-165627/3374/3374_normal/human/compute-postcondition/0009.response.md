According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `args` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements for the loop to execute another time**
