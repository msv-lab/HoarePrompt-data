According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is updated after division by `x`, and `cnt` is 1. This means that `ai` must have been divisible by `x` in the previous iteration. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `ai` after the division by `x` needs to still be divisible by `x`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`cnt` is 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x` and is divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again**
