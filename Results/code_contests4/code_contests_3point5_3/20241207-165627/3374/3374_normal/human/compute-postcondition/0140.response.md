Example Answer:
`min_idx` is assigned the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`. The values of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, and `x` are assigned new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`**
