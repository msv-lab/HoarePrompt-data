According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the index `i` is less than the length of list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 and it should be less than the length of list `a`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cnt` is the total number of times all elements in `a` were divisible by `x` before they were no longer divisible, `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`**.
