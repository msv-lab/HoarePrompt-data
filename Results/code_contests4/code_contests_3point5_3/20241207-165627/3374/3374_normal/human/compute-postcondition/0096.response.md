Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `x` are assigned by splitting the input into integers. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time the number of zeros in the list `pow_x` must be greater than `t`, `n` and `x` are assigned new values from input.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` are assigned new values from input, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same.**
