Example Answer:
`cnt` is initialized to 0. The other variables remain the same as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in the list, `cnt` is 0.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in the list, `cnt` is 0**
