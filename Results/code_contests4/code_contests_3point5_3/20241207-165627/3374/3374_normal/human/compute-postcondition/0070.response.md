According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. If this condition is met, the loop will execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same. `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is 1, `pow_x[i]` is updated to 0, and `ai` is now the result of the floor division of `ai` by `x`.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `ai` after the floor division operation must still satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is 1, `pow_x[i]` is updated to 0, `ai` is now the result of the floor division of `ai` by `x` for the loop to execute again `ai % x == 0`**
