According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. The value of `ai` must be such that `ai % x == 0` holds true.
2. `i` should be updated to the next index in the list `a`.
3. `cnt` needs to be increased by 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is updated to the next index, `cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is such that `ai % x == 0`**
