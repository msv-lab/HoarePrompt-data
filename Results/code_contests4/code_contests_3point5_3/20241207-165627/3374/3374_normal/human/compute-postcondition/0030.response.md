Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `cnt` is the total number of times all elements in `a` were divisible by `x` before they were no longer divisible, `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`.**
