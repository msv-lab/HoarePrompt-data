According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `args` list must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements for the loop to execute another time**
