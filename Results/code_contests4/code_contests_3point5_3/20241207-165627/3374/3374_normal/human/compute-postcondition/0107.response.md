According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` have new values, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, `ai` is updated to the integer division of itself by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 2. For the loop to execute again, `ai % x` should be equal to 0.

State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` have new values, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, `ai` is updated to the integer division of itself by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `ai % x` should be equal to 0**
