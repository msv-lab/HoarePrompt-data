According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the number of zeros in the list `pow_x` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0 and `ai` is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in the list**
