Example Answer:
The value of `pow_x[i]` is updated to `cnt`, which is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` has been updated by floor dividing it by `x` for each element in the list, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x` in the list `a`, and `pow_x[i]` is updated to `cnt`.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` has been updated by floor dividing it by `x` for each element in the list, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x` in the list `a`, `pow_x[i]` is updated to `cnt`**
