Example Answer:
`ai` is updated by performing integer division with `x`. As `ai` remains divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again, the value of `ai` will be updated accordingly. The value of `cnt` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x` and remains divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x` and remains divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again**
