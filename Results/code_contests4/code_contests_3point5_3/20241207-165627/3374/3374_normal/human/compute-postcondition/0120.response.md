According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been modified by floor division with `x` and `cnt` is 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `ai` needs to be such that the new value after floor division with `x` still satisfies the condition `ai % x == 0`. Therefore, `ai` should be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is 2, `ai` has been modified by floor division with `x`, for the loop to execute again `ai` must satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`**
