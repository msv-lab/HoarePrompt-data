According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ai`. If `ai` is divisible by `x`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is a value from the list `a` that has been divided by `x` till it is no longer divisible. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value in the list `a` after `ai` must be divisible by `x`. Additionally, the `pow_x[i]` needs to be updated to reflect the new count. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1, for the loop to execute the next time, the next element in `a` after `ai` must be divisible by `x` and `pow_x[i]` needs to be updated**.
