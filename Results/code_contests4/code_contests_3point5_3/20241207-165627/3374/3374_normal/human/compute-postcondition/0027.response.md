Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is increased by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 2. After execution, the new value of `cnt` is 3. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, all elements in `a` have been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, for the loop to execute the first time selected `ai` should be divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time `ai` should still be divisible by `x`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, all elements in `a` have been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, for the loop to execute the first time selected `ai` should be divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time `ai` should still be divisible by `x`**
