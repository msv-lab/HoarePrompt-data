Example Answer:
`pow_x[i]` is assigned the value `cnt`, where `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`. Since `ai` is no longer divisible by `x`, the value of `cnt` remains the same. The loop has no more elements in the list `a` to execute, so the output state is: `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, `ai` is no longer divisible by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there are no more elements in the list `a` for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, `ai` is no longer divisible by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there are no more elements in the list `a` for the loop to execute**
