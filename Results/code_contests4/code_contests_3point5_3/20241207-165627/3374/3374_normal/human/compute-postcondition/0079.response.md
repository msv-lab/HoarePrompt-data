Example Answer:
`cnt` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` remains the same, `n`, `x`, `a`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the next index, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `pow_x[i]` is updated, `ai` is updated, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `cnt` is 0.
Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n`, `x`, `a`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the next index, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `pow_x[i]` is updated, `ai` is updated, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`, `cnt` is 0**
