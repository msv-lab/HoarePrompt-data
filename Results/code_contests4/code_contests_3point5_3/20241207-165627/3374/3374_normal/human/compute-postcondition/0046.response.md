Example Answer:
`min_idx` is assigned the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`. The variable `min_pow` contains the minimum value in the list `pow_x` which was already identified. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with the total number of times each element in `a` was divisible by `x` before becoming indivisible, `min_pow` is the minimum value in the list `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with the total number of times each element in `a` was divisible by `x` before becoming indivisible, `min_pow` is the minimum value in the list `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`**
