Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. The previous values of `t`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, and `min_idx` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is one less than the previous value, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same.
Output State: **`t` is one less than the previous value, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same**
