Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values entered as integers after splitting the input. The previous values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is one less than the previous value, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same.
Output State: **`t` is one less than the previous value, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same**
