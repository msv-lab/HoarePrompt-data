Example Answer:
`ai` is divided by `x`, and since `ai` was divisible by `x`, the division result will be an integer. Therefore, after execution, `ai` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there is at least one more element in the list `a` for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there is at least one more element in the list `a` for the loop to execute the first time**
