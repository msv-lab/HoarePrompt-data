Example Answer:
`min_idx` is assigned the index of the minimum value in `pow_x` which is stored in `min_pow`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same.**
