Example Answer:
`pow_x` is assigned a list of `n` zeros. Since `t` is one less than the previous value, `n`, the list `pow_x` will have `t` zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx` remain the same**
