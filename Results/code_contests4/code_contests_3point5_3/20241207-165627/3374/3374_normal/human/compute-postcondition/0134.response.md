Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is increased by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x` and remains divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is updated after division by `x` and remains divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again**
