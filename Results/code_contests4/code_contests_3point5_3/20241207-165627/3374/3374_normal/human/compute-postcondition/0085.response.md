Example Answer:
The value of `ai` is divided by the value of `x` using floor division and the result is assigned back to `ai`. The state of `cnt` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is updated based on the floor division operation.
Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `ai` is updated based on the floor division operation**
