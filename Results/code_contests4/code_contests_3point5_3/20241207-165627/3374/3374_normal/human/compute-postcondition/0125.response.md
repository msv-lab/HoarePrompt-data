According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is the number of times `ai` can be divided by `x` without a remainder, `ai` is not divisible by `x` anymore, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list `a`.
State: **`cnt` is the number of times `ai` can be divided by `x` without a remainder, `ai` is not divisible by `x` anymore, `pow_x[i]` is equal to `cnt`, there is at least one more element in the list `a`**
