According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. Right before the loop, `ai` comes from the list `a` and `i` is 2, so `ai` corresponds to `a[2]`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `a[2]` should be divisible by `x`. Therefore, the next value of `a[2]` should be such that `a[2] % x == 0`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element where each element has been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`, for the loop to execute the first time `a[2] % x == 0`**
