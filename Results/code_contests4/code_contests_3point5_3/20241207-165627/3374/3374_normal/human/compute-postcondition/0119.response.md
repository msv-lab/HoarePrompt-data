Example Answer:
`ai` is divided by `x` using floor division and the result is assigned back to `ai`. The value of `cnt` is 2, but the initial value of `ai` and `x` is unknown, so the new value of `ai` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is 2, `ai` has been modified by floor division with `x`.
Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `ai` has been modified by floor division with `x`**
