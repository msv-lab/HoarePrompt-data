According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai` being divisible by `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been divided by `x` till it is no longer divisible, so for the loop to execute one more time, `ai` should still be divisible by `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, `a` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, all elements in `a` have been divided by `x` till they are no longer divisible, for the loop to execute the first time selected `ai` should be divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time `ai` should still be divisible by `x`**
