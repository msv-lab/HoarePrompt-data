Example Answer:
`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The value of `at_start` and `args` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is True initially, for the loop to execute the first time; `args` is a list with at least 1 element.
Output State: **`at_start` is True initially, for the loop to execute the first time; `args` is a list with at least 1 element**
