Example Answer: 
`pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. Depending on the initial state, if `ai` is divisible by `x` for all elements in list `a`, then `cnt` holds the total number of times `ai` can be divided by `x`. If not, `cnt` is 0. The value of `i` represents the index of the last element processed in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: If `ai` is divisible by `x` for all elements in list `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` can be divided by `x`, `ai` is the result of the last division operation, `i` is the index of the last element processed in list `a`. If `ai` is not divisible by `x` for any element in list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the last processed element value, `i` is the index of the last processed element in list `a`.
Output State: **If `ai` is divisible by `x` for all elements in list `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` can be divided by `x`, `ai` is the result of the last division operation, `i` is the index of the last element processed in list `a`. If `ai` is not divisible by `x` for any element in list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the last processed element value, `i` is the index of the last processed element in list `a`.**
