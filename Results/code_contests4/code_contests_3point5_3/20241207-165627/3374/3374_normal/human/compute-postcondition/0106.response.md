Example Answer:
`ai` is updated to the integer division of itself by `x`, therefore its value changes. `cnt` is also incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` have new values, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, `ai` is updated to the integer division of itself by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `ai % x` should be equal to 0.
Output State: **`t` is the number of zeros in the list `pow_x`, `n` and `x` have new values, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` remain the same, `ai` is updated to the integer division of itself by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `ai % x` should be equal to 0**
