Example Answer:
`pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The loop condition indicates that the loop has completed, and the values of variables have been updated based on the division operation by `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` have been updated based on the division operation by `x` and the loop completion condition.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[i]`, `cnt` have been updated based on the division operation by `x` and the loop completion condition**
