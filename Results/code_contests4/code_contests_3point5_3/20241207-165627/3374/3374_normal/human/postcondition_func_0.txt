The function func_1 reads input values, performs calculations on the input data, and calls func_2 with specific arguments. It iterates over a range of t, where t is the number of test cases. For each test case, it calculates the number of times each element in a list can be divided by x, finds the minimum division count, and then calculates a specific value based on this minimum count and indices. However, the actual purpose or expected behavior of the function is not clearly defined.
