Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, iterates over the array elements, calculates the number of times each element can be divided by x, finds the minimum number of divisions, and then calculates the sum of the array elements as required. The function func_2 correctly prints the output in the required format. The program handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.
