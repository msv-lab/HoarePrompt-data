Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the elements of the array, checks if the current element is divisible by x, and then adds x copies of the integer q/x to the end of the array. The process continues until the robot encounters an element that is not divisible by x. The sum of all values in the array at the end of the process is calculated correctly. The program also handles multiple test cases as described in the input format. Overall, the program meets all the requirements and works correctly for all potential cases.
