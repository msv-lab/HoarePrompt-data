Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25 by considering all possible cases of swapping adjacent digits. The program handles the cases where it is impossible to obtain a number divisible by 25 and outputs -1 in those cases. The logic of the program aligns with the problem requirements and it correctly calculates the minimum number of moves needed.
