Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The program is intended to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25 by swapping adjacent digits. However, the code implementation seems to be overly complicated and does not cover all possible cases. 

For example, if the input number is '1241367', the code should output -1 as it is impossible to obtain a number divisible by 25. However, the code may not handle this case correctly due to the complex logic and multiple conditions in the implementation.

Therefore, based on the complexity of the code and the potential for missing certain cases, the correctness of the program is deemed to be false.
