Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2 + 1`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute the last time, the first element of list `t` is '0', the element at index `n - 3` in list `t` is '0', and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `t[i]` is not equal to '0'.***
