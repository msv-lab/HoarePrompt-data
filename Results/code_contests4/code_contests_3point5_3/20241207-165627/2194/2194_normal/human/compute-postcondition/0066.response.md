Example Answer:
The value at index j+1 in list t is assigned the value at index j. The length of list t is n, so this operation is valid as long as j+1 is a valid index. '5' is not found in list t, so the value '5' is not present in any of the elements. The variable ans is increased by 1. The value of n is greater than i+1, so the index j+1 is within the bounds of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1.
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1**
