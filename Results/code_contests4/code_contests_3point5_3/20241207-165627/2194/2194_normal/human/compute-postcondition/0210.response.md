Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes. s is a string input where zero, five, two, seven are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string s respectively. If seven >= 1 and five >= 1, n is the length of list t, ans is equal to n - i + k, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1. If the first element of list t is '0', then if n equals 3, ans is 10^15. If n is greater than 3, ans is equal to n - i + 4. If i is less than n - 3, then i is the new index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1. The variable `fin` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`. Additionally, zero >= 1 and five >= 1. `t` is assigned the list of characters from string `s`. `n` is the length of list `t`.**
