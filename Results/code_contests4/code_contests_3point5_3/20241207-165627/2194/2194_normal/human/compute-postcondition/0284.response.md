Postcondition: ***`ans` will be increased by 10^15 times if `n` equals 3, otherwise `ans` will be increased by `n - 2` times. `n` will remain a positive integer between 2 and 10^18, `s` will be a non-empty string, `zero` will remain greater than or equal to 1, `five` will remain greater than or equal to 1, `two` and `seven` will be the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string `s` respectively, `i` will be `n - 2` if `n` equals 3, otherwise `i` will be 0, `t` will be a list of characters from string `s`, with the first element being '0' if `n` equals 3, otherwise `t` will start with '0'. `fin` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`. `temp` will be assigned the value of `t[n - 2]` in both cases, and `t[n - 2]` will be equal to `temp`.***
