According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 0. 
Before the loop starts, n is the length of list t and ans is 0. To execute the loop, n should be greater than 0, i should be equal to n-1, and t should be a non-empty list.
State: **n is the length of list t, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to n-1, `t` is a non-empty list**
