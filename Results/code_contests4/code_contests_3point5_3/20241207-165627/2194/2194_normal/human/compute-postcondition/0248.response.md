Postcondition: ***`ans` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^18, `s` is a string, `zero` >= 1, `five` >= 1, `two`, `seven` are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string `s` respectively, `i` is n - 3, `t` is a list of characters from string `s`, `fin` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `t[i]` is equal to '5', the program fragment executes and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
