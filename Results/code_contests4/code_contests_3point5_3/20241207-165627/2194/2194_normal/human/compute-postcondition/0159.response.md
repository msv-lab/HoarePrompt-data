For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `i` should be set to n - 2
- `ans` should be updated to n - (n - 2) - 1
- If '5' is found in list t, the loop should break at that index
- If '5' is not found, the loop should continue until j reaches n - 2

State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 1, n is greater than 0, i is equal to n - 2, t is a non-empty list, if '5' exists in t, loop will break at index '5', if '5' does not exist, loop will continue until j reaches n - 2**
