Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string input and performs various calculations based on the occurrences of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in the string. It then updates and prints the minimum value calculated. The function is intended to handle cases where certain characters are present multiple times in the input string and adjust the calculations accordingly to find the minimum value. The code includes multiple loops to iterate through the string and perform specific operations based on the characters found. The final output is either the calculated minimum value or -1 if it exceeds 10^10. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the user is expected to provide a string input.**
