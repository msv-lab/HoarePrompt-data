According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2 + 2`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]`, the first element of list `t` is '0', the element at index `n - 3` in list `t` is '0', and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `t[i]` is not equal to '0'. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
1. `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 1`.
2. The loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `n - 3`, so `n - 1` should be less than `n - 3`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
3. The new value of `i` should be less than `n - 3`, so `n - 1` should be less than `n - 3`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2 + 2`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute the last time, the first element of list `t` is '0', the element at index `n - 3` in list `t` is '0', and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `t[i]` is not equal to '0'.**
