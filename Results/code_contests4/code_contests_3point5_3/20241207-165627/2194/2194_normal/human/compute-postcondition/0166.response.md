According to the code, the loop can execute until i reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 1, n is greater than 0, i is equal to n - 3, t is a non-empty list, and the value at index i is '7'. To execute the loop one more time, i should be decremented by 1 (i = i - 1) and the value at the new index i (i - 1) should be checked. 
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 1, n is greater than 0, i is equal to n - 4, t is a non-empty list, value at index i - 1 is '7'**
