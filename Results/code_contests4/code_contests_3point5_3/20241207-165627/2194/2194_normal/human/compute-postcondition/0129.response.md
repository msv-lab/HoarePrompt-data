Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes. s is a string input where zero, five, two, seven are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string s respectively. fin is 10^18. If zero >= 2, the list t contains characters of string s, ans is either the sum of n - 1 - i and n - 2 - i where i ranges from n - 1 to 0, or it remains 0, and cnt is either 1 or 0 based on the conditions met during each iteration. If two >= 1 and five >= 1, n is the length of list t, ans is increased by n * (n - 1) / 2, '5' is not found in list t, i is equal to n - 2, n is greater than or equal to n-2, temp is assigned the value of t[j] for the loop to execute the last time, the first element of list t is '0', if n is equal to 3, ans is assigned the value 10, otherwise, if n is greater than or equal to 3, i is equal to n - 3, ans is increased by n * (n - 1) / 2 + (n - 3), fin is assigned the minimum value between fin and ans. If (seven >= 1 and five >= 1): `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes. s is a string input where zero, five, two, seven are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string s respectively. fin is 10^18. If zero >= 2, the list t contains characters of string s, ans is either the sum of n - 1 - i and n - 2 - i where i ranges from n - 1 to 0, or it remains 0, and cnt is either 1 or 0 based on the conditions met during each iteration. If two >= 1 and five >= 1, n is the length of list t, ans is increased by n * (n - 1) / 2, '5' is not found in list t, i is equal to n - 2, n is greater than or equal to n-2, temp is assigned the value of t[j] for the loop to execute the last time, the first element of list t is '0', if n is equal to 3, ans is assigned the value 10, otherwise, if n is greater than or equal to 3, i is equal to n - 3, ans is increased by n * (n - 1) / 2 + (n - 3), fin is assigned the minimum value between fin and ans. If (seven >= 1 and five >= 1), `t` is a list created from string `s`.**
