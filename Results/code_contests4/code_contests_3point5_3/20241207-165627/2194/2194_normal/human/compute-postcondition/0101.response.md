Example Answer:
`ans` is increased by 1. Since `ans` is initially increased by `n+2`, and now it is also increased by 1, the final value of `ans` will be `n+3`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is increased by `n+3`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to n-1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is increased by `n+3`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to n-1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute one more time**
