According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and n. If i is less than n-1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, i should be increased by 1 to move to the next index.
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1, i is incremented by 1**
