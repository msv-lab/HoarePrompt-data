Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `str(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `str` converts it to a string. The value of `n` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes, `s` is a string input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes, `s` is a string input**
