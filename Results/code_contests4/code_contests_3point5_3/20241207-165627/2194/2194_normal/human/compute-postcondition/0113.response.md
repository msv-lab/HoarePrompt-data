Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute the last time, the first element of list `t` is '0'. If the element at index `i` in list `t` is not '0', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, while maintaining the initial conditions.***
