Postcondition: ***n is the length of list t, s is a string input, zero, five, two, seven are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string s respectively, fin is 10^18, t is a list containing characters of string s, ans is either equal to the initial value of ans plus the result of n - 1 - i and cnt is incremented by 1, or ans is n - 2, cnt is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In both cases, n is greater than 0, i is initialized to n - 1, and t[i] is equal to '0', after the execution of the if statement.***
