Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, n is greater than 0, i is equal to the first index of '5' in list t (if '5' exists in the list) or -1, t is a non-empty list. If '5' is found in list t, the loop breaks at that index. If '5' is not found in list t, then i is -1. For the loop to execute, j starts from i and goes up to n-2**
