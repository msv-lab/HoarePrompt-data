Example Answer:
temp is assigned the value of t[j + 1], where j is a valid index. Since j + 1 is used, the value of temp will be the element in t at index j + 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 5, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index and is incremented by 4, n is greater than i + 3, temp is assigned the value of t[j + 1].
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 5, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index and is incremented by 4, n is greater than i + 3, temp is assigned the value of t[j + 1]**
