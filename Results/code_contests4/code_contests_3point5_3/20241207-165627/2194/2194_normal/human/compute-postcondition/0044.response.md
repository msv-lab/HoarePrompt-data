Postcondition: ***n is the length of list t, s is a string input, zero, five, two, seven are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string s respectively, fin is 10^18, t is a list containing characters of string s, ans is either updated based on the conditions mentioned, cnt is incremented by 1, i is decremented by 1, t[i] is not equal to '0'. If t[i] == '0' and cnt == 0, ans is increased by the value of n - 1 - i and cnt is incremented by 1. If t[i] == '0' and cnt == 1, ans is updated based on the calculation ans += n - 2 - i. After the execution of the if statement, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
