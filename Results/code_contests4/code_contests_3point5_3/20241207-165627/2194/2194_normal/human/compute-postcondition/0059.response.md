According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of list `t` in reverse order, starting from `n-1` and ending at 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute another time `i` is decremented by 1. If `t[i] == '5'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is 0, n is greater than 0, for the loop to execute another time i is decremented by 1. If t[i] == '5', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, i is decremented by 1**
