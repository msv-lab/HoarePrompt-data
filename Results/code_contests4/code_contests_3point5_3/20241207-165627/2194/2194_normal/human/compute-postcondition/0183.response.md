Example Answer: 
The value at index `j + 1` in list `t` is assigned the value at index `j`. Since `t` is a non-empty list, this operation will shift all elements in `t` to the right starting from index `j + 1`. The value of `t` changes after this operation. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the length of list `t`. The value of `i` might change if the first occurrence of '7' is shifted. The value of `ans` remains unchanged. The loop will execute another time only if the new index of '7' is less than `n - 1`.
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is 4, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t, t has been shifted, and the value of temp is dependent on the value of j for the loop to execute another time i must be less than n - 1**
