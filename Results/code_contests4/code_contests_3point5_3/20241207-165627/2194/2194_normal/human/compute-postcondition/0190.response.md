According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 3. Before the loop starts, the conditions to be adjusted are:
- `n` should be greater than 3
- `i` should be the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1
- The values in list t will be shifted accordingly if '7' is not found
- The first element of list t is '0'
- `ans` is equal to n - i + 1

State: **Output State: n is the length of list t, ans is equal to n - i + 1, n is greater than 3, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1, t is a non-empty list with the first element being '0'.**
