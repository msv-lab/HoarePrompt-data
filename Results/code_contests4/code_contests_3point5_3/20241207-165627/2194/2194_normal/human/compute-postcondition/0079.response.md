According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is the length of list `t`, and i is a valid index equal to n-1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be set to n-2 to match the loop range. Additionally, since '5' is not found in list `t`, it does not affect the loop execution. 
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by (n-1), '5' is not found in list t, i is equal to n-2, n is greater than n-1, temp is assigned the value of t[j] for the loop to execute the first time**
