According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from n-2 to 0 in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, n is the length of list t, ans is increased by (n-1), '5' is not found in list t, i is equal to n-3, n is greater than n-1, temp is assigned the value of t[j]. So to execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by n, '5' is not found in list t, i is equal to n-4, n is greater than n-1, temp is assigned the value of t[j] for the loop to execute the second time**
