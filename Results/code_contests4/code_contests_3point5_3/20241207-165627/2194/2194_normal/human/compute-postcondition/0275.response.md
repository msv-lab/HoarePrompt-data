According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`. If `n` is greater than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is not equal to 3. Since the loop is iterating over `xrange(n-3)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 4.
State: **`ans` will be increased by 1, `n`, `s`, `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven`, `i`, `t`, `fin`, `temp` remain unchanged, the first element of list `t` is still '0', for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4**
