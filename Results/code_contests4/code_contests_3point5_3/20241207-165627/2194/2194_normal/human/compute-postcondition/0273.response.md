Postcondition: ***`ans` will be increased by `n - 2` times, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^18, `s` is a non-empty string, `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven` are greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `t` is a non-empty list of characters from string `s`, `fin` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 2]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `temp`, the first element of list `t` is equal to '0', `n` is not equal to 3 for the loop to execute, if `t[i]` is not equal to '0', no changes occur in the variables as the code snippet is a simple break statement that exits the loop or if statement directly.***
