Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes, s is a string input, zero, five, two, seven are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string s respectively, fin is 10^18. If zero >= 2, the list t contains characters of string s, ans is either the sum of n - 1 - i and n - 2 - i where i ranges from n - 1 to 0, or it remains 0, and cnt is either 1 or 0 based on the conditions met during each iteration.***
