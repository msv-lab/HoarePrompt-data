Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to n-2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute the last time, and the first element of list `t` is '0'. If `n` is equal to 3, `ans` is assigned the value 10. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2 + (n - 3)`.***
