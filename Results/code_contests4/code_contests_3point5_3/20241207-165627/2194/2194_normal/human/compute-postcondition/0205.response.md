Postcondition: ***Output State: n is the length of list t, ans is equal to n - i + k, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1, t is a non-empty list. If the first element of list t is '0', then if n equals 3, ans is 10^15. If n is greater than 3, ans is equal to n - i + 4. If i is less than n - 3, then i is the new index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1.***
