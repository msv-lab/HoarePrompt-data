Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes. If the integer value of `s` is divisible by 25, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes. `s` is a non-empty string with counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string `s` denoted by zero, five, two, seven respectively. If zero and five are both greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is increased by 10^15 times if `n` equals 3, otherwise `ans` is increased by `n - 2` times. The variable `fin` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`. If `fin` is greater than 10^10, then `fin` retains its current value. If `fin` is not greater than 10^10, then `fin` retains its current value.***
