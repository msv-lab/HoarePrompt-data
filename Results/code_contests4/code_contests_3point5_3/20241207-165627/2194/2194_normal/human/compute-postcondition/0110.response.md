According to the code, the loop will execute `n - 3` times, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3. The loop starts from `i = 0` and ends at `i = n - 4` (since it is `xrange(n - 3)`). 

Given the initial state, the following adjustments are needed:
1. Set `n` to be greater than or equal to 3.
2. Set `i` to 0 as it starts from 0.
3. Set `ans` to be increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
4. `5` should not be found in list `t`.
5. `temp` should be assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute the last time.
6. The first element of list `t` should be '0'.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute the last time, the first element of list `t` is '0'**
