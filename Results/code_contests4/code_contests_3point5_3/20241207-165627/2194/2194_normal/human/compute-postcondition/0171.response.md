Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1, so after execution `ans` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 2, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists), t is a non-empty list. For the loop to execute, i is not equal to -1
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 2, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists), t is a non-empty list. For the loop to execute, i is not equal to -1**
