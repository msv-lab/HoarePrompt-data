Example Answer:
temp is assigned to the value at index j in list t. The values of n, ans, '5', i remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1.
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1**
