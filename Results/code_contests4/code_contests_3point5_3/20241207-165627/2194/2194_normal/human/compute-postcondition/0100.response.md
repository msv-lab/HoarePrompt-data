According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is increased by `n+2`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to n-2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` needs to be greater than or equal to n-1.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is increased by `n+2`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to n-1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute one more time**
