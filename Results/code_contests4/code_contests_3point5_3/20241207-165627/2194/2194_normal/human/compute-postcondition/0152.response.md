Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, then `t[j + 1]` is updated to be equal to `t[j]`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 2, n is greater than 0, i is equal to the first index of '5' in list t (if '5' exists in the list) or -1, t is a non-empty list, j is increased by 1, temp is assigned t[j + 1], t[j + 1] is now equal to t[j.
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 2, n is greater than 0, i is equal to the first index of '5' in list t (if '5' exists in the list) or -1, t is a non-empty list, j is increased by 1, temp is assigned t[j + 1], t[j + 1] is now equal to t[j]**
