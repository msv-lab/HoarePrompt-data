Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes, `s` is a string, zero >= 1, five >= 1, two, seven are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string s respectively, i is an integer, `t` is a list of characters from string `s`, `fin` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`, for the loop to execute `n` is a positive integer. If the character at index `i` in list `t` is '0', then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
