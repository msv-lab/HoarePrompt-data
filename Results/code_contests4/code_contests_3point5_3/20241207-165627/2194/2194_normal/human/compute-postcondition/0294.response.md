The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the parameter constraints: n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to return the parameter constraints for n, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes.
