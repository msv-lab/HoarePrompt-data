Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The value of `j` is not provided, so the exact value of `temp` cannot be determined. The loop will execute another time if `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list `t`, ans is 4, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list `t`, `t` is a non-empty list, and the value of `temp` is dependent on the value of `j`, for the loop to execute another time i must be less than `n - 1.
Output State: **n is the length of list `t`, ans is 4, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list `t`, `t` is a non-empty list, and the value of `temp` is dependent on the value of `j`, for the loop to execute another time i must be less than `n - 1**
