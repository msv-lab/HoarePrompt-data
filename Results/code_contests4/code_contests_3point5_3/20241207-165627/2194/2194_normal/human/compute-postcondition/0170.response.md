According to the code, the loop will execute if n is greater than 1 and i is not equal to -1. The loop will break if '7' is found in the list before reaching n - 2. If '7' is not found, the loop will continue until i reaches -1. For the loop to execute, i needs to be adjusted based on the first occurrence of '7' in the list t. 
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 1, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists), t is a non-empty list. For the loop to execute, i is not equal to -1**
