Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, where `j` is the index variable. The value of `j` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `temp`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 2, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists), t is a non-empty list, and the value of `temp` is dependent on the value of `j`.
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 2, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists), t is a non-empty list, and the value of `temp` is dependent on the value of `j`.**
