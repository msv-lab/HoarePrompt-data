Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, where `j` is assumed to be a valid index. The length of list `t` is `n`, so `j + 1` is a valid index as well. As '5' is not found in list `t`, the output state remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1.
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 1, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1**
