According to the code, the loop will execute for `n - 3` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2 + 1`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute the last time, the first element of list `t` is '0'. If the element at index `i` in list `t` is not '0', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. So for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by `n * (n - 1) / 2 + 1`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]` for the loop to execute the last time, the first element of list `t` is '0', the element at index `n - 3` in list `t` is '0'.**
