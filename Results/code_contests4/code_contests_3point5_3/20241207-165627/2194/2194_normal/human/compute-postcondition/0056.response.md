According to the code, the loop iterates over the list in reverse order until i reaches 0. At the end of the last iteration, n is the length of list t, ans is 0, n is greater than 0. If t[i] == '5', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. So for the loop to execute one more time, i should be decremented by 1 and n should still be greater than 0.
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is 0, n is greater than 0, for the loop to execute another time i is decremented by 1**
