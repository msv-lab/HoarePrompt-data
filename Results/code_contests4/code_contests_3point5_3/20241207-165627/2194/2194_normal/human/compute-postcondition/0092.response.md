Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, where `j` is the current index. The value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is increased by `n+1`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to n-2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` for the loop to execute the last time.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is increased by `n+1`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to n-2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` for the loop to execute the last time**
