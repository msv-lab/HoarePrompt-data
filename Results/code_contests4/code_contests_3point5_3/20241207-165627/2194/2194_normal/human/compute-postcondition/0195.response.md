According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since the loop stops when `i` reaches `n - 3`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n - 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: n is the length of list t, ans is equal to n - i + 1 (incremented by 1), n is greater than 3, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1, t is a non-empty list with the first element being '0'.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to consider that i is incremented by 1, and it should be less than n - 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If '7' exists in list t, the new index of the first occurrence of '7' should be considered.

State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to n - i + 1 (incremented by 1), n is greater than 3, i is the new index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1, t is a non-empty list with the first element being '0' and i is less than n - 2**
