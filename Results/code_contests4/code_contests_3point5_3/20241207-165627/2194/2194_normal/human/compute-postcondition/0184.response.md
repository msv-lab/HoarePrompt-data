Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is assigned to the element at index `j` in list `t`. The loop will execute another time if `i` is less than `n - 1`. The variables affected are `t` and `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is 4, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t, t has been shifted, and the value of temp is dependent on the value of j for the loop to execute another time i must be less than n - 1.
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is 4, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t, t has been shifted, and the value of temp is dependent on the value of j for the loop to execute another time i must be less than n - 1**
