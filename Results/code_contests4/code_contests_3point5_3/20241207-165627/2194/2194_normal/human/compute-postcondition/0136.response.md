According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to n-1, and `t` is a non-empty list. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be one less than the current value of `i`.
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is 0, n is greater than 0, i is equal to n-2, t is a non-empty list**
