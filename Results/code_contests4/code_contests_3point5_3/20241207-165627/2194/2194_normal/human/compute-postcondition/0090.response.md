According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is equal to 0, `ans` is increased by n, '5' is not found in list t, n is greater than or equal to n-2, and temp is assigned the value of t[j] for the loop to execute the last time.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is increased by `n`, '5' is not found in list `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to n-2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j] for the loop to execute the last time**.
