Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to 1, n is greater than 0, i is equal to the first index of '7' in list t (if '7' exists in the list) or -1, t is a non-empty list. If '7' is found in the list, the loop will break at that index. If '7' is not found, the loop will continue until i reaches -1.**
