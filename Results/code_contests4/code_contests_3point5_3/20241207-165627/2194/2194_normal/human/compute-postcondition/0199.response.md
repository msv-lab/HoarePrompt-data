According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `i` should be less than `n - 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is equal to `n - i + 2`, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is the new index of the first occurrence of '7' in list `t` (if '7' exists) or -1, `t` is a non-empty list with the first element being '0' and `i` is less than `n - 2`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the new values should be:
State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to n - i + 3, n is greater than 3, i is the new index of the first occurrence of '7' in list t (if '7' exists) or -1, t is a non-empty list with the first element being '0' and i is less than n - 3**
