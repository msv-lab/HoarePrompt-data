Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is equal to n - i - 1, n is greater than 0, i is equal to the first index of '5' in list t (if '5' exists in the list) or -1, t is a non-empty list. If '5' is found in the list, the loop will break at that index. If '5' is not found, the loop will continue until j reaches n - 2.**
