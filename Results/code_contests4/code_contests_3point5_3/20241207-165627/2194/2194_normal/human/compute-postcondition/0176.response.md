Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is increased by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is equal to 2, after execution, `ans` will be 3. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list `t`, ans is 3, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list `t` (if '7' exists), `t` is a non-empty list, and the value of `temp` is dependent on the value of `j`. The value at index `j + 1` in list `t` is now equal to the value at index `j`. For the loop to execute another time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
Output State: **n is the length of list `t`, ans is 3, n is greater than 0, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in list `t` (if '7' exists), `t` is a non-empty list, and the value of `temp` is dependent on the value of `j`. The value at index `j + 1` in list `t` is now equal to the value at index `j`. For the loop to execute another time, `i` must be less than `n - 1**.
