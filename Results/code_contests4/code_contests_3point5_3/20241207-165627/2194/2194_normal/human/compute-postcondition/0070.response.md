Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, where `j` is not defined in the initial state. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 2, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1, i is incremented by 2, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.
Output State: **n is the length of list t, ans is increased by 2, '5' is not found in list t, i is a valid index, n is greater than i+1, i is incremented by 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`**
