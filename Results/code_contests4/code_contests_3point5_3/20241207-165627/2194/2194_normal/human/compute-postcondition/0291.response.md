Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 without leading zeroes. `s` is a non-empty string where zero, five, two, seven are the counts of '0', '5', '2', '7' characters in string `s` respectively. If both zero and five are greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is increased by 10^15 times if `n` equals 3, otherwise `ans` is increased by `n - 2` times. The variable `fin` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`. Additionally, the value of `fin` is not greater than or equal to 10**
