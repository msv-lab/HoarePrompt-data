Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all the potential cases as mentioned in the problem description. It only checks for specific cases like the presence of '0', '2', '5', '7' in the input number, but does not cover all possible combinations of adjacent digit swaps to make the number divisible by 25. For example, consider the input '1241367', the program may not output the correct minimum number of moves required to make it divisible by 25.
