Correctness: False

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25. It uses a complex logic involving counting the occurrences of specific digits and swapping adjacent digits. However, this logic does not cover all possible cases and can lead to incorrect results. For instance, for the input "1241367", the program should output -1 according to the problem description, but it may not do so with the current implementation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
