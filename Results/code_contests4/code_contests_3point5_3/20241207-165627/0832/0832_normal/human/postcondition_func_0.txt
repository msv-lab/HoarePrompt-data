The function `func` reads input for integers n, m, and k. It then calculates values for x and y based on specific conditions. If k - n is less than or equal to -1, it prints y and k + 1 and exits the program. Otherwise, it updates the values of k, t, p, y, and x accordingly, and prints the calculated values of y and x. The function does not return any value but operates on the predefined parameters n, m, and k.
