Example Answer:
The value of `t` is calculated by dividing `k` by `(m - 1)`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer and `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, the division operation will result in an integer value for `t`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)` and the code prints `y` (which is 1) and `k + 1`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)` and the code prints `y` (which is 1) and `k + 1`**
