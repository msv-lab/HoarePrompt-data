Example Answer: 
Since `k` is decreased by `n`, and `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, the resulting `k` will still be less than `n*m`. If `k - n <= -1`, the code will print `y` (which is 1) and `k + 1`. Since `k` is less than `n`, `k - n` will always be less than -1, so the code will always print `y` (which is 1) and `k + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, and the code prints `y` (which is 1) and `k + 1`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, and the code prints `y` (which is 1) and `k + 1`**
