Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts space-separated inputs and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are valid based on the initial state.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`.**
