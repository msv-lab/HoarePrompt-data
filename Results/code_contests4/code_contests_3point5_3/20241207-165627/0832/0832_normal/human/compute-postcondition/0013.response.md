Example Answer:
The value of `y` is printed as is. The value of `x` is not directly calculated in the code snippet provided, but it is determined based on the values of `k`, `m`, and `p`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is determined based on the values of `k`, `m`, and `p`, `y` is an even integer, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`, `p` is between 0 and `m-2`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is determined based on the values of `k`, `m`, and `p`, `y` is an even integer, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`, `p` is between 0 and `m-2`**
