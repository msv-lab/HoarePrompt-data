Example Answer: 
`y` is assigned the value of `n - t`, where `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2 and `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`. Since `n` and `m` are even integers, `n - t` will result in an even integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is an even integer, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`, `p` is between 0 and `m-2`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is an even integer, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`, `p` is between 0 and `m-2`**
