Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of `k % (m - 1)`. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, and `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the value of `p` will be between 0 and `m-2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`, `p` is between 0 and `m-2`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`, `p` is between 0 and `m-2`**
