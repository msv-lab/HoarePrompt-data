Example Answer: 
`y` is assigned the value 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
