Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is calculated as `k / (m - 1)`. The value of `x` is then determined based on the condition `t % 2 == 0`. If `t` is even, `x` is assigned the value `2 + p`, otherwise, `m - p` is assigned to `x`. Since `t` is calculated based on `k`, `m`, and `p`, the final value of `x` depends on these variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is determined based on the values of `k`, `m`, and `p`, `y` is an even integer, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`, `p` is between 0 and `m-2`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is determined based on the values of `k`, `m`, and `p`, `y` is an even integer, `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)`, `p` is between 0 and `m-2`**
