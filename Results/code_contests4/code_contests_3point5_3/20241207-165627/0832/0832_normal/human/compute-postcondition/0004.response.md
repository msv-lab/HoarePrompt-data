Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1. The value of `k` minus `n` is less than or equal to -1. The code prints the value of `y` (which is 1) and `k + 1`, where `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`.**
