Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It first reads the input values for n, m, and k. Then it calculates the final position of Lara after she has moved k times according to the given path. The program handles the edge case where k is less than or equal to n and prints the correct position. The program then calculates the final position based on the formula provided in the problem description and prints the row and column where Lara ends up. The program also uses the math.ceil function to round the row position correctly. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
