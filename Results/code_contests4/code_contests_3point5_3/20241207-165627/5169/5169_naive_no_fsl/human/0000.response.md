Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by iterating through the books on each desk and choosing the one that can be read within the given time constraint. It keeps track of the total time spent reading and the count of books read. The program terminates when either all books from one desk are read or the total time exceeds the given limit. The output is the maximum number of books that can be read within the time limit. The logic implemented in the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
