The function `func_21` accepts a string `s` and writes the value of the string to the standard output stream using `sys.stdout.write()`. However, the code as it is will not return the value of the string written to the standard output stream as the annotation suggests. Instead, it will print the string `s` to the standard output stream but not return it.
