Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code appears to correctly implement the problem description by handling the input values according to the constraints provided.
- The functions and their annotations seem to align with the overall goal of determining the maximum number of books that can be read within a given time limit.
- The main function `func_22` iterates through the lists of book reading times on desks A and B, considering the time limit, and calculates the maximum number of books that can be read.
- The code also includes utility functions to handle calculations, prime numbers, divisors, and input processing, all of which seem relevant to the problem context.
- Based on a careful review of the code and problem description, as well as the provided examples, there are no identified discrepancies or cases where the code does not follow the problem description.
