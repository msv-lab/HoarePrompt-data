Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_22` attempts to determine the maximum number of books that can be read within a specified time limit by iterating through the books on both desks based on certain conditions. However, the code does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. For instance, if the time limit `K` is such that it is possible to read more books by alternating between the desks in a different order, the code may not account for this and provide an incorrect output.

Therefore, the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect outcome.
