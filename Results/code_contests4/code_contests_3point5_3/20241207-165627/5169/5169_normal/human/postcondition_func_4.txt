The function `func_5` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns either an empty list if `n` is less than 2, or a list 'r' containing all prime numbers from 2 up to the last prime number 'p' less than or equal to 'n'. The function utilizes a sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers efficiently.
