The function func_18 accepts three positive integers a, sep, and end representing the total number of books, separation time, and end time respectively. It prints the elements of list `a` separated by `sep` and ending with `end` as specified. However, it does not calculate or return the total time taken to read all the books on both desks as mentioned in the annotations.
