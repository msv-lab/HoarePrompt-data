The function `func_16` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It internally uses the values of N, M, K, A_i, and B_i. The function calls `func_12` and splits the output into a list of strings. It may encounter potential issues if the output of `func_12` is not a string that can be split. The function's purpose is to process the result of `func_12` and return it as a list of strings.
