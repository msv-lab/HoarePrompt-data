The function func_9 accepts two parameters x and y, representing positive integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y using the Euclidean algorithm. It iterates through the calculation until y becomes 0, updating the values of x and y accordingly. Finally, it returns the greatest common divisor, which is the final value of x after the loop terminates when y becomes 0.
