The function `func_10` takes a list of integers `a` as input. It iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If at any point an element is greater than the next one, it returns False. If all elements satisfy the condition, it returns True, indicating that the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function handles cases where the list is not sorted correctly, ensuring a proper True/False return based on the sorting condition.
