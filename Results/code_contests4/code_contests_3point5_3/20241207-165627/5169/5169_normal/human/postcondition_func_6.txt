The function `func_7` takes two parameters `n` and `primes`. It iterates over the elements in `primes`, updating the total number of divisors of `n` based on the divisibility by each prime number. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns the current value of `divs_number`. After the loop, the function returns the final value of `divs_number`, which is the product of all `t` values calculated during the iterations. The functionality involves updating the divisor count based on prime factors in `primes` and returning the total number of divisors of `n`.
