Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is either 1 or 0; ptr2 is either 1 or 0 based on the conditions. totaltime is updated by adding the value of a at index ptr1 if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k in the if part, otherwise totaltime remains the same in the else part. check is False, count is 0.**
