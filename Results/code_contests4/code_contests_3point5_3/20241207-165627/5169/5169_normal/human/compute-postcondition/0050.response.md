Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: totaltime is incremented by the value of b[ptr2], where ptr2 is either 1 or 0; count is increased by 1.
Output State: **totaltime is incremented by the value of b[ptr2], where ptr2 is either 1 or 0; count is increased by 1**
