Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, `a`, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count` have their final values based on the conditions met during the loop execution. To execute the loop one more time, if the loop breaks then `check` is False and `ptr1` is increased by 1. If the loop completes without breaking, `check` is True and `ptr1` is equal to `N`. Additionally, totaltime added to b[ptr2] is less than or equal to k.***
