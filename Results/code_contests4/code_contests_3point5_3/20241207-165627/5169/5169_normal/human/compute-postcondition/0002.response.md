Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, so the value of `b` depends on the return value of `func_15()`. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15()**
