Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9, a is assigned the value returned by func_15(), ptr1 is either 1 or 0, ptr2 is either 1 or 0. For the loop to execute again, ptr1 needs to be less than N and ptr2 needs to be less than M, check is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
