Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, `a`, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count` have their final values based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k, then `totaltime` is increased by the value of b[ptr2], `count` is incremented by 1, and `ptr2` is incremented by 1. If totaltime + b[ptr2] > k, then `check` is False, `ptr1` is increased by 1, and `ptr1` is equal to `N`.***
