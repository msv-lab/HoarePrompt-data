Example Answer:
Since the code snippet provided only assigns a boolean value to the variable `check`, and there are no conditions or calculations involved, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9, a is assigned the value returned by func_15(), ptr1 is either 1 or 0, ptr2 is either 1 or 0, check is False.
Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9, a is assigned the value returned by func_15(), ptr1 is either 1 or 0, ptr2 is either 1 or 0, check is False**
