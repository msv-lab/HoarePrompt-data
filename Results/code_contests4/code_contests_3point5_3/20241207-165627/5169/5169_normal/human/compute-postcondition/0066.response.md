Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is less than N; ptr2 is either less than M or equal to M based on the conditions. check is False. count is the total count of elements added to totaltime. totaltime + a[ptr1] is greater than k**
