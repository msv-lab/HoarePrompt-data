Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, `a`, `ptr1`, `totaltime`, `check` are adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute one more time. If totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k, `count` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is incremented by the value of `b` at index `ptr2`, and `ptr2` is incremented by 1. If totaltime + b[ptr2] > k, `N`, `M`, `K`, `a`, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` are set to False, `count` is not updated, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
