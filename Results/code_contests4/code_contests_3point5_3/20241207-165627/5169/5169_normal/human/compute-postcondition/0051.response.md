Example Answer:
ptr2 is incremented by 1. The value of ptr2 can be either 1 or 0, so after execution, ptr2 becomes either 2 or 1. The totaltime is incremented by the value of b[ptr2], and count is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: totaltime is incremented by the value of b[ptr2], where ptr2 is either 2 or 1; count is increased by 1.
Output State: **totaltime is incremented by the value of b[ptr2], where ptr2 is either 2 or 1; count is increased by 1**
