Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_15()`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the exact value of `a` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15().
Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15()**
