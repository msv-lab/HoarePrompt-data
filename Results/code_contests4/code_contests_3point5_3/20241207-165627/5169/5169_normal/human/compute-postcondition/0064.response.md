Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is increased by 1; ptr2 is either less than M or equal to M based on the conditions. totaltime is the total time taken based on the conditions in the loop. check is False. count is the total count of elements added to totaltime. After entering the if condition, the totaltime increased by the value of a[ptr1] is less than or equal to K, count is increased by 1.**
