Postcondition: ***N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is either 1 or 0; ptr2 is either 1 or 0. In the if part, totaltime is updated by adding the value of a at index ptr1 if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, otherwise totaltime remains the same. If a[ptr1] < b[ptr2], the values are updated accordingly based on the conditions. If totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, check is True and count is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, ptr1 needs to be less than N and ptr2 needs to be less than M. In the else part, totaltime is updated by adding the value of a at index ptr1 if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, otherwise totaltime remains the same. If a[ptr1] < b[ptr2], the values are updated accordingly based on the conditions. check is True and count is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, ptr1 needs to be less than N and ptr2 needs to be less than M.***
