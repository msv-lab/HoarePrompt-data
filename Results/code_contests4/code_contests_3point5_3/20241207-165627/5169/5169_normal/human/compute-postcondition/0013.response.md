Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `K` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000 and 1 <= `K` <= 10^9. `A_i` and `B_i` are integers such that 1 <= `A_i`, `B_i` <= 10^9; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`; `ptr1` is 1; `ptr2` is 0; `totaltime` is updated by adding the value of `a` at index `ptr1`; `check` is True; `count` is incremented by 1.**
