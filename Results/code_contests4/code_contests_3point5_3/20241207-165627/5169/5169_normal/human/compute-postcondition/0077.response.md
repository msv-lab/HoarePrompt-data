Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is either less than N or increased by 1; ptr2 is either less than M or equal to M based on the conditions. totaltime is the total time taken based on the conditions in the loop. check is False. count is the total count of elements added to totaltime. If totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, totaltime is increased by the value returned by func_15() at index ptr1+1 and count is incremented by 1. If the else part is executed, ptr1 is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time before breaking out of the loop or if statement, for the loop to execute again `ptr1` needs to be less than N; totaltime is updated by adding the value at index ptr1 of list a**
