Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the return values of `func_14()`. The function `func_14()` returns three integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are dependent on the implementation of `func_14()`, which is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9.
Output State: **N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9.**
