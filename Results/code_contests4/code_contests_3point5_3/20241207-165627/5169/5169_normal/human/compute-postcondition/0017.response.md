Postcondition: ***N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is either 1 or 0; ptr2 is 0; totaltime is updated by adding the value of a at index ptr1 if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, otherwise totaltime remains the same. check is either True or False based on the condition. count is either incremented by 1 if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, otherwise count remains the same. The value of a at index ptr1 is less than the value of b at index ptr2.***
