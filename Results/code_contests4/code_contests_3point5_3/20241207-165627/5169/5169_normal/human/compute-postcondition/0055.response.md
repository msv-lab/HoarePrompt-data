Postcondition: ***N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9, a is assigned the value returned by func_15(), ptr1 is either 1 or 0, ptr2 is either 1 or 0. If a[ptr1] < b[ptr2] and totaltime + a[ptr1] is less than or equal to K, then totaltime is updated based on the value at index ptr1 of list a, count is increased by 1, and ptr1 is increased by 1. If a[ptr1] < b[ptr2] and totaltime + a[ptr1] is greater than K, the check is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[ptr1] is not less than b[ptr2] and totaltime + b[ptr2] is less than or equal to K, totaltime is incremented by the value of b[ptr2], count is increased by 1. If a[ptr1] is not less than b[ptr2] and totaltime + b[ptr2] is greater than K, the check is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
