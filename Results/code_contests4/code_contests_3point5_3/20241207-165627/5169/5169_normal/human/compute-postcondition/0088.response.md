Example Answer:
`ptr2` is incremented by 1, which means it now points to the next element in the array. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `K`, `a`, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` have their final values based on the conditions met during the loop execution. `totaltime` is increased by the value of `b[ptr2]`. `count` is incremented by 1. `ptr2` is incremented by 1.
