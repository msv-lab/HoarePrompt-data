Output State: N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is 0; ptr2 is 0; totaltime is updated by adding the value of a at index ptr1; check is True; count is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The value of a at index ptr1 is less than the value of b at index ptr2. totaltime + a[ptr1] is less than or equal to k.
