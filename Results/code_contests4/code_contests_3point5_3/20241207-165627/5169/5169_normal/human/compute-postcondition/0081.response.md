Output State: **N, M, and K remain integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i remain integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a remains assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 remains either less than N or increased by 1; ptr2 remains either less than M or equal to M based on the conditions. totaltime remains the total time taken based on the conditions in the loop. check remains False. count remains the total count of elements added to totaltime.**
