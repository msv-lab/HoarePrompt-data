Postcondition: ***N, M, K are integers; A_i, B_i are integers; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(); `ptr1` is either 1 or 0; `ptr2` is either 1 or 0; totaltime is updated by adding the value of `a` at index `ptr1` if `totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k`, otherwise totaltime remains the same; check is either True or False; `count` is either incremented by 1 or set to 0; If `a[ptr1] < b[ptr2]`, values are updated based on conditions; For the loop to execute again, `ptr1` needs to be less than `N` and `ptr2` needs to be less than `M`; `count` is incremented by 1. In the else part, N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is either 1 or 0; ptr2 is either 1 or 0 based on the conditions. totaltime is updated by adding the value of a at index ptr1 if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k in the if part, otherwise totaltime remains the same in the else part. check is False, count is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
