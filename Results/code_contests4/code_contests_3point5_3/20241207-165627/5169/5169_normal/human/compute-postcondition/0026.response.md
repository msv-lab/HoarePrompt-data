Postcondition: ***Output State: N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). If totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k, then ptr2 is updated to 1, totaltime is incremented by b[ptr2], check is True, and count is set to 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If totaltime + b[ptr2] is greater than k, then ptr2 remains 0, totaltime is reset to 0, check is set to False, and count is 0.***
