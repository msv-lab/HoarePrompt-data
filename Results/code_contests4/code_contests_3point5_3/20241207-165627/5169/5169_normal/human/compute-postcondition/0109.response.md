Postcondition: ***N, M, and K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. A_i and B_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9; a is assigned the value returned by func_15(). ptr1 is either less than N or equal to N; ptr2 is either less than M or equal to M based on the conditions. totaltime is the total time taken based on the conditions in the loop. If check is False, the value of `count` is printed, otherwise the value of `count` is printed.***
