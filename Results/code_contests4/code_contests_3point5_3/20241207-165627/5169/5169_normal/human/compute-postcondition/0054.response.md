Postcondition: ***N, M, K are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9, a is assigned the value returned by func_15(), ptr1 is either 1 or 0, ptr2 is either 1 or 0. If totaltime + b[ptr2] is less than or equal to K, totaltime is incremented by the value of b[ptr2], count is increased by 1. Otherwise, check is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
