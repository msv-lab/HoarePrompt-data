The function func_6 accepts two integers `n` and `start`, then it calculates and returns a list of divisors of `n`. If `n` is a perfect square, only the square root of `n` is included once in the list. If `n` is not a perfect square, the list includes both divisors and their complements. The function correctly computes the divisors and their complements for non-perfect square numbers.
