The function `func_22` does not accept any parameters but operates on predefined constraints. It iterates through two lists `a` and `b` based on certain conditions, updating `totaltime` and `count`. If a condition is met, it prints the final count. However, the function does not return any specific value or perform additional operations beyond the loop iterations.
