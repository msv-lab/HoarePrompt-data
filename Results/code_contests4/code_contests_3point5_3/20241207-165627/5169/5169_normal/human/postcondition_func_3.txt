The function `func_4` accepts a single parameter `Sum` and calculates the maximum integer `n` such that the summation of numbers from 1 to `n` is less than or equal to `Sum`. The function then returns this calculated `n` value. Note that the function relies on the mathematical formula ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2 to determine the result. It is assumed that `Sum` is a non-negative number.
