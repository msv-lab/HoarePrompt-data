Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input values for N, M, K, A and B. It then iterates through the books on Desk A and Desk B while keeping track of the total time spent reading. It chooses the book that takes the least time to read at each step until the total time exceeds K or all books are read. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of books that can be read within the given time constraint. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description and handles all possible cases.
