Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the desired answer modulo 998,244,353 for all potential cases. The issue lies in the calculation of the variables `o` and `e` based on the values of `l` and `r`. The logic used to determine `o` and `e` is incorrect and does not cover all possible scenarios. 

To illustrate an example where the program fails, consider the input:
```
1 2 1 2
```
The correct output for this input should be 2. However, the program does not produce the correct result for this case due to the incorrect logic used to calculate `o` and `e`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
