The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. 

Case_1: If `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns the result of subtracting `b` from `a`.

Case_2: If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the function returns the result of subtracting `a` from `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and based on their values, return the result of the subtraction either `a - b` or `b - a`.
