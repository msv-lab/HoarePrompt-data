Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. If `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns the result of subtracting `b` from `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the function returns the result of subtracting `a` from `b`. However, one potential edge case that is missing from the annotations is when `a` is equal to `b`, in which case the function would return 0.
