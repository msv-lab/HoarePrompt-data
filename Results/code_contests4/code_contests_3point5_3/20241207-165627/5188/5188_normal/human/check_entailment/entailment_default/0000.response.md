Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints indicate that the function `func_1` should return 0 when `a` is equal to `b`, but the code does not handle this case. Additionally, the code has duplicate parts which are unnecessary and may introduce errors. This lack of handling the case where `a` is equal to `b` and the presence of duplicate code sections make the program incorrect.
