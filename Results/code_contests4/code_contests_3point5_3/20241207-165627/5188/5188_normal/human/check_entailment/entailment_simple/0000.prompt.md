You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Alice has got addicted to a game called Sirtet recently.

In Sirtet, player is given an n × m grid. Initially a_{i,j} cubes are stacked up in the cell (i,j). Two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. Player can perform the following operations: 

  * stack up one cube in two adjacent cells; 
  * stack up two cubes in one cell. 



Cubes mentioned above are identical in height.

Here is an illustration of the game. States on the right are obtained by performing one of the above operations on the state on the left, and grey cubes are added due to the operation.

<image>

Player's goal is to make the height of all cells the same (i.e. so that each cell has the same number of cubes in it) using above operations. 

Alice, however, has found out that on some starting grids she may never reach the goal no matter what strategy she uses. Thus, she is wondering the number of initial grids such that 

  * L ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ R for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m; 
  * player can reach the goal using above operations. 



Please help Alice with it. Notice that the answer might be large, please output the desired value modulo 998,244,353.

Input

The only line contains four integers n, m, L and R (1≤ n,m,L,R ≤ 10^9, L ≤ R, n ⋅ m ≥ 2).

Output

Output one integer, representing the desired answer modulo 998,244,353.

Examples

Input


2 2 1 1


Output


1


Input


1 2 1 2


Output


2

Note

In the first sample, the only initial grid that satisfies the requirements is a_{1,1}=a_{2,1}=a_{1,2}=a_{2,2}=1. Thus the answer should be 1.

In the second sample, initial grids that satisfy the requirements are a_{1,1}=a_{1,2}=1 and a_{1,1}=a_{1,2}=2. Thus the answer should be 2.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a > b) :
        return a - b
        #The program returns the result of subtracting integer b from integer a, where a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9 and a is greater than b
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. a is less than or equal to b
    return b - a
    #The program returns the result of subtracting 'a' from 'b', where 'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9 and a is less than or equal to b

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
