Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The issue lies in the calculation of the variables `o` and `e` based on the conditions `if l % 2 and r % 2` and `elif l % 2 + r % 2`. These conditions are not handling all possible cases and may lead to incorrect results.

To demonstrate the issue, consider the following input:
Input:
```
2 2 1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
For this input, the correct answer is 1 since the only initial grid that satisfies the requirements is `a_{1,1}=a_{2,1}=a_{1,2}=a_{2,2}=1`. However, the provided program may not produce the correct output for this case due to the incorrect calculation of `o` and `e`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
