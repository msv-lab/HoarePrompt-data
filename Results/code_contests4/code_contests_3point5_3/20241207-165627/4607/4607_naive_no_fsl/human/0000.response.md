Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program first reads the input values and sorts them.
- It then checks for the number of cards and applies different logic based on the number of cards.
- The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description like when there is only one card, two cards, or more than two cards.
- It correctly handles cases where there are multiple possible numbers that can be written on the additional card, and prints them in increasing order.
- The program also covers edge cases like when the common difference between the numbers is 0 or when there are multiple possible common differences.
- Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem and covers various scenarios.
