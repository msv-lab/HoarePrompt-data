The function `func_15` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and determines if `n` is a prime number. The function returns True if `n` is prime and False otherwise. The code iterates through certain conditions to check for divisibility and returns the appropriate result. It covers cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3, divisible by 2 or 3, and checks for other factors to determine primality.
