I will now analyze the provided code based on the problem description and the output hints to determine its correctness.

Upon initial assessment, the code seems to address the problem of finding the minimum number of rotations required to form an arithmetic progression with the given sequence of numbers. The functions appear to handle the input, process the sequence, and output the required information.

Next, I will verify if the output hints agree with the code and provide any additional insights into potential cases that the code might not be handling correctly.

Based on the output hints and the code provided, the following potential issues can be identified:
1. The code might not consider all cases where there are multiple possible numbers that could be added to the sequence to form an arithmetic progression.
2. The code may not handle edge cases where the initial sequence is already an arithmetic progression.

Considering the identified issues, it is crucial to evaluate if the code covers all potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Now, I will carefully review the code along with the output hints to determine if the program follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code may not handle cases where there are multiple valid numbers that can be added to the sequence to form an arithmetic progression. Additionally, the code might not account for edge cases where the initial sequence is already an arithmetic progression. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
