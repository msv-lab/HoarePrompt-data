Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The functions defined in the code handle the input processing, sorting, and calculations required to determine the additional card number that can be added to Alexander's cards to form an arithmetic progression.
- The main function `func_17` processes the sequence of integers on Alexander's cards and determines the appropriate output based on various conditions such as the length of the sequence, the differences between adjacent elements, and the presence of specific values in the sequence.
- Based on the annotations and the code logic, the program covers all potential cases described in the problem statement and provides the correct output in each scenario. There are no discrepancies between the problem description, annotations, and the actual code implementation.
