Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes the input, sorts the sequence of integers, and then checks multiple cases to determine the possible numbers that can be added to form an arithmetic progression. It handles edge cases like having only one or two cards, as well as cases where there are multiple possible numbers that can be added.

The program uses various functions to handle different parts of the logic, making the code modular and easier to understand. It correctly calculates the potential numbers that can be added to form an arithmetic progression and prints the output as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for various scenarios.
