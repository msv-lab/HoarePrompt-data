Example Answer:
`at_start` is reassigned the value `False`, which is the same value as the initial state. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False**
