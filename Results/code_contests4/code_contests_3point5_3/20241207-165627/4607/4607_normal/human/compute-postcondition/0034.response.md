According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 which will make `i` equal to 3.
State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `i` is 3**
