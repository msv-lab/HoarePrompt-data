Output State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with an additional element appended based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, for the loop to execute the third time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `x` is calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
