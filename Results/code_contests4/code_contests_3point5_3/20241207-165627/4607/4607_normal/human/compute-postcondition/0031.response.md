According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Since the loop is iterating over `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `g` contains the difference between the second and first elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `i` is 1**
