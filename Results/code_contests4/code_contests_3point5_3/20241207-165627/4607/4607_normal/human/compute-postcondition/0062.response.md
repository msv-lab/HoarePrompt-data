According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and the loop is expected to execute again. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 3.
State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[i])`, `i` is 3 for the loop to execute, `gc` is updated with the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[3])**
