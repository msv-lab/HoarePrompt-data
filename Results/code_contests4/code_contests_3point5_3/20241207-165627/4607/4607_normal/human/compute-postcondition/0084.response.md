According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is 2 in this case. Before the loop starts, `gc` is assigned a value based on a function `func_14` and `l` is empty. Additionally, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with additional elements calculated based on a specific formula. `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`.

To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with additional elements calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is equal to 2**
