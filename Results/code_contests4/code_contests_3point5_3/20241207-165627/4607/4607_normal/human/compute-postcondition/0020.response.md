Example Answer: 
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the value returned by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If the key 'end' is present in `kwargs`, it will pop and return its value, otherwise, it will return '\n'. Since `kwargs` is not defined in the initial state, an error would occur. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False**
