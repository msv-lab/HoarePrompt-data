Example Answer:
`l` is updated by appending the absolute difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of list `a`. Since `i` is 3, the 4th element is `a[4]` and the 3rd element is `a[3]`. Therefore, the absolute difference between `a[4]` and `a[3]` is appended to `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a` as well as the absolute difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of list `a`, `i` is 3, `g` is updated to include the positive difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of list `a`**
