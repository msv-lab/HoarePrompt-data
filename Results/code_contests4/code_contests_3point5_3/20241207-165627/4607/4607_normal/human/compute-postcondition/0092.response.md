Output State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with additional elements calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is the total number of elements in list `a`, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains all the differences `a[i + 1] - a[i]` for each iteration of the loop. Additionally, the length of the list `l` after removing duplicates is equal to 1.**
