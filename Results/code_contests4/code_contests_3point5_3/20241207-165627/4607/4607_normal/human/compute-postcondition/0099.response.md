Functionality: **The function `func_17` processes a sequence of integers present on Alexander's cards. It does not accept any parameters and operates independently. The sequence has a length `n`, where `n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 10^5. Each integer in the sequence is a positive integer and does not exceed 10^8. The function performs various operations on the sequence, such as sorting, calculation of differences between elements, and handling specific cases based on the length of the sequence. It uses conditions to determine actions to take based on the characteristics of the input sequence. The final functionality of the function is to process the given sequence of integers on Alexander's cards according to the specified constraints.**
