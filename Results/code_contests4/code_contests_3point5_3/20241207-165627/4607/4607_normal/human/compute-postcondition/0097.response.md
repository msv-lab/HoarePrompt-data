Postcondition: ***`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the result of the calculation `a[0] - (a[1] - a[0])` and `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])` appended at the end, `l` is a list containing unique elements, `l` is sorted in ascending order. If the length of unique elements in `g` is greater than 2, the program exits. If the length of list `g` after removing duplicates is equal to 1, then `func_18` is executed with the length of `l` as the parameter. Otherwise, `gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with additional elements calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is the total number of elements in list `a`, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains all the differences `a[i + 1] - a[i]` for each iteration of the loop. If the length of the list `l` after removing duplicates is equal to 1, then the function `func_18` is called with no impact on the initial state variables. Otherwise, the length of the unique elements in list `l` is not equal to 1.***
