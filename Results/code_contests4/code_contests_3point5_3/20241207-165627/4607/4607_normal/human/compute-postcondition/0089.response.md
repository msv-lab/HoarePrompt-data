Output State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with additional elements calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is 4, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the difference `a[i + 1] - a[i]` from the last iteration of the loop, and a new difference `a[i + 1] - a[i]` is appended to `l**.
