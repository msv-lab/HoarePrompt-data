According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in `args` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is False. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in `args` to iterate over.
State: **`sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is False**
