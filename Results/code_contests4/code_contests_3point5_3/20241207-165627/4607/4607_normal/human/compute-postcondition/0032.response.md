Example Answer:
`g` is appended with the difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` in list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, the difference will always be positive. Therefore, `g` will contain all positive differences. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `i` is 2**
