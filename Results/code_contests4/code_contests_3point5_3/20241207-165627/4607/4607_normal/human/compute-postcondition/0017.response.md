Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file `file`. The value of `sep` is not mentioned, so it remains as ' '. If `file` is not specified in the kwargs, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. After the execution, `at_start` is set to False due to the if-else block. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False**
