Example Answer:
The function `func_18` is executed with the length of list `l` as the parameter. The length of `l` is the number of unique elements in the list, so the function is executed with that value as the parameter. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the result of the calculation `a[0] - (a[1] - a[0])` and `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])` appended at the end, `l` is a list containing unique elements, `l` is sorted in ascending order, `func_18` is executed with the length of `l` as the parameter.
Output State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the result of the calculation `a[0] - (a[1] - a[0])` and `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])` appended at the end, `l` is a list containing unique elements, `l` is sorted in ascending order, `func_18` is executed with the length of `l` as the parameter**
