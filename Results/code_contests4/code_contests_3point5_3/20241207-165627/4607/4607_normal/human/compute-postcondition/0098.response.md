The function `func_17` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input values. The function processes a sequence of integers on Alexander's cards. The sequence has a length `n`, where `n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 10^5. Each integer in the sequence is a positive integer and does not exceed 10^8. The function performs certain operations on the sequence of integers but does not return any specific value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_17` is to process a sequence of integers on Alexander's cards based on the given constraints.
