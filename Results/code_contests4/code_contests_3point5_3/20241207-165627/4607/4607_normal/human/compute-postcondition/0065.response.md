According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `gc`, `a`, `g`, and `l` are already defined. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be adjusted to be at least 2 and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0**
