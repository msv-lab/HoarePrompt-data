Example Answer:
`str(x)` is written to the `file`. The initial state of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is assigned True.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is assigned True**
