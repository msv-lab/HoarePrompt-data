According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to the length of list `l`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` is 2
- `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`
- `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`
- `gc` is assigned the value of the first element of list `l`
- `i` is 1

State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `gc` is assigned the value of the first element of list `l`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute**
