Output State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with additional elements calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`. If the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not equal to `gc` for any iteration, then the loop breaks and the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
