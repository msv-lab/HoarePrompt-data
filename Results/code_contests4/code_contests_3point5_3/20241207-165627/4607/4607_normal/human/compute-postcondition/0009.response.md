According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are still elements in the `args` list. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, and `at_start` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `args` list.
State: **`sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements in the `args` list**
