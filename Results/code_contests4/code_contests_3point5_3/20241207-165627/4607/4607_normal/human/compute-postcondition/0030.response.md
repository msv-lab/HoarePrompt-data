Example Answer:
The absolute difference between the elements at index i+1 and i of list `a` is calculated and appended to list `l`. Since `i` is 0, the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a` is calculated and added to list `l`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `g` contains the difference between the second and first elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `g` contains the difference between the second and first elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `i` is 0**
