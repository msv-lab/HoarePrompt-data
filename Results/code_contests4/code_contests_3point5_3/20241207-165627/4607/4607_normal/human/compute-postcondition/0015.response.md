Example Answer: 
The `write` method of the `file` object is called with the value of `sep`, which is ' '. The value of `sep` is ' ' and the value of `file` is `sys.stdout`, so after execution, a space is written to the standard output. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned ' ', `file` is assigned `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned ' ', `file` is assigned `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False**
