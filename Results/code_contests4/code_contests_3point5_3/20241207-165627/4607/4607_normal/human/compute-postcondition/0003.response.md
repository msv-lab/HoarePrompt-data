According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the args list. Before the loop starts, the variables sep, file, and at_start are already assigned their default values if not provided in kwargs. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.
State: **No adjustments needed, `sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is assigned True**
