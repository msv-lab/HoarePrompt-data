According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `i` must be less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 2 and `i` is 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` remains 2 but `i` should be 1.
State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with an additional element appended, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
