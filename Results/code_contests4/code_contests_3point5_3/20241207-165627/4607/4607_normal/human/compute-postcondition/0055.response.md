Postcondition: ***`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`. If the length of unique elements in `g` is greater than or equal to 2, the length of unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, and 0 is present in `l`, then the program exits.***
