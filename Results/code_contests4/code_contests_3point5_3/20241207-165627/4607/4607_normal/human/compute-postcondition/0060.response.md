According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[i])`, `i` is 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[i])`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute**
