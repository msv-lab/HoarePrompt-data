Example Answer:
`at_start` is reassigned the value False. The previous value of `at_start` was True. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is False**
