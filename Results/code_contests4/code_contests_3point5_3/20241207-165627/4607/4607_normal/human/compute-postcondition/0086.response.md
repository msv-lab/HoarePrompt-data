According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with additional elements calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is 2, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the difference `a[i + 1] - a[i]` from the last iteration of the loop. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 2.
State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[len(l)-1])`, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order with additional elements calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is 3, `g` contains positive differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `l` contains the difference `a[i + 1] - a[i]` from the last iteration of the loop**
