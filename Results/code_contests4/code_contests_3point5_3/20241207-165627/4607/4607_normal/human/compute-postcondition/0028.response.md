According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list sorted in ascending order does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `g` and `l` remain empty lists, and `i` is 0.
State: **`a` is a list sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `g` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
