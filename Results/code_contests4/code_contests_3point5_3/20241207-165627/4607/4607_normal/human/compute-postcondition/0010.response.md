Example Answer: 
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. If `sep` is ' ', then a space is written to the standard output. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements in the `args` list.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned ' ' if not in kwargs, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout` if not in kwargs, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements in the `args` list**
