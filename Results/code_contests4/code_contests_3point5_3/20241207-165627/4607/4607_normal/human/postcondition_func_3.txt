The function `func_4` reads an integer `n` followed by a sequence of `n` integers representing the numbers on Alexander's cards. It then converts these integers to strings and returns a map object containing these string representations. The function does not handle the constraints on the range of input values (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, integers not exceeding 10^8) as described in the annotations.
