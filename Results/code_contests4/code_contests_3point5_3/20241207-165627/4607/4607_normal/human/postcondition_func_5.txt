The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and thread stack size, then starts a new thread that executes the `main` function. It does not accept any parameters and likely performs operations or calculations on a sequence of integers representing Alexander's cards. The function does not return any specific value, but it potentially handles tasks concurrently due to the threading implementation.
