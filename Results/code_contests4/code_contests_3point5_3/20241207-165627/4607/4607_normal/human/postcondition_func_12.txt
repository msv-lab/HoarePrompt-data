The function `func_13` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of cards and the sequence of integers on the cards respectively. `p` is a positive integer that doesn't exceed 10^8. The function calculates a result based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `p` using bitwise operations and modular arithmetic. It then returns the calculated result.
