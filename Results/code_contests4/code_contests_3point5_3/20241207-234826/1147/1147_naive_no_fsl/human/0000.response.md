Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where a trump card can beat any non-trump card regardless of rank. This logic is missing in the code, so the program is incorrect. 

For example, if the input is:
```
H
8C 6H
```
The program should output "YES" because the first card beats the second one as it is a trump card. However, the program will output "NO" because it does not consider the trump suit rule.
