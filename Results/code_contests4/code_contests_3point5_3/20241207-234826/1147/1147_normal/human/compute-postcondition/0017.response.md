Functionality: **The function reads input from the user, assigns values to variables `coz`, `f`, and `s` based on the input, and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If the second character of `f` is equal to `coz` and the second character of `s` is not equal to `coz`, it prints 'YES'. If the second character of `f` is not equal to `coz` and the second character of `s` is equal to `coz`, it prints 'NO'. If the second character of `f` is equal to the second character of `s`, and the first character of `f` is greater than the corresponding value of `d` for the first character of `s`, it prints 'YES'. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and the output is based solely on user input and the defined conditions.**
