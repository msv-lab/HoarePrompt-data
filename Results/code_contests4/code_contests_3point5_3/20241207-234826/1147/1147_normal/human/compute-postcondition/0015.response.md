Postcondition: ***`coz` is a string, `f` and `s` are assigned values based on user input. If the second character of `f` is equal to `coz` and the second character of `s` is not equal to `coz`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if the second character of `f` is not equal to `coz`, the second character of `s` is equal to `coz`, or both conditions are true, the program checks additional conditions. If the second character of `f` is equal to the second character of `s`, and the first character of `f` is greater than the value of `d` corresponding to the first character of `s`, 'NO' is printed. However, if either `f[1]` is not equal to `s[1]` or `f[0]` is less than or equal to `d[s[0]]`, 'NO' is printed. In both cases, the variables `coz`, `f`, and `s` are updated based on the input values, and the program either prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met.***
