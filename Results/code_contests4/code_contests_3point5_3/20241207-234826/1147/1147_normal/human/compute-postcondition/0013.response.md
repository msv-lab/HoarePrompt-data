Postcondition: ***`coz` is a string, `f` and `s` are assigned values based on user input. The second character of `f` is not equal to `coz`, or the second character of `s` is not equal to `coz`, or both conditions are false. If the second character of `f` is equal to the second character of `s`, and the first character of `f` is greater than the value of `d` corresponding to the first character of `s`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, if either `f[1]` is not equal to `s[1]` or `f[0]` is less than or equal to `d[s[0]]`, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the program's final state involves the variables `coz`, `f`, and `s` being updated based on the input values, with the program either executing specific conditions or printing 'NO'.***
