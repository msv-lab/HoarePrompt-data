Example Answer:
`f` and `s` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input string into two parts based on whitespace. Since the initial state is `coz` is a string, the values of `f` and `s` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `coz` is a string, `f` and `s` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`coz` is a string, `f` and `s` are assigned values based on user input**
