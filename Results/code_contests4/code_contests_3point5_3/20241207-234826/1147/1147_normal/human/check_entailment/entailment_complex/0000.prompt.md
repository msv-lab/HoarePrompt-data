You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a card game called "Durak", which means "Fool" in Russian. The game is quite popular in the countries that used to form USSR. The problem does not state all the game's rules explicitly — you can find them later yourselves if you want.

To play durak you need a pack of 36 cards. Each card has a suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C") and a rank (in the increasing order "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"). At the beginning of the game one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump. 

The players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards.

A card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards’ ranks are. In all other cases you can not beat the second card with the first one.

You are given the trump suit and two different cards. Determine whether the first one beats the second one or not.

Input

The first line contains the tramp suit. It is "S", "H", "D" or "C".

The second line contains the description of the two different cards. Each card is described by one word consisting of two symbols. The first symbol stands for the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"), and the second one stands for the suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C").

Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes) if the first cards beats the second one. Otherwise, print "NO" (also without the quotes).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    coz = raw_input()
    f, s = raw_input().split()
    d = {'6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13,
    'A': 14}
    if (f[1] == coz and s[1] != coz) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (f[1] != coz and s[1] == coz) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            if (f[1] == s[1] and [f[0]] > d[s[0]]) :
                print('YES')
            else :
                print('NO')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`coz` is a string, `f` and `s` are assigned values based on user input. The second character of `f` is not equal to `coz`, or the second character of `s` is not equal to `coz`, or both conditions are false. If the second character of `f` is equal to the second character of `s`, and the first character of `f` is greater than the value of `d` corresponding to the first character of `s`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, if either `f[1]` is not equal to `s[1]` or `f[0]` is less than or equal to `d[s[0]]`, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the program's final state involves the variables `coz`, `f`, and `s` being updated based on the input values, with the program either executing specific conditions or printing 'NO'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`coz` is a string, `f` and `s` are assigned values based on user input. The second character of `f` is not equal to `coz`, the second character of `s` is equal to `coz`, or both conditions are true. If the second character of `f` is equal to the second character of `s`, and the first character of `f` is greater than the value of `d` corresponding to the first character of `s`, then the program executes the if part and prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if either `f[1]` is not equal to `s[1]` or `f[0]` is less than or equal to `d[s[0]]`, the program executes the else part and prints 'NO'. In both cases, the final state involves the variables `coz`, `f`, and `s` being updated based on the input values, with the program either executing specific conditions or printing 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`coz` is a string, `f` and `s` are assigned values based on user input. If the second character of `f` is equal to `coz` and the second character of `s` is not equal to `coz`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if the second character of `f` is not equal to `coz`, the second character of `s` is equal to `coz`, or both conditions are true, the program checks additional conditions. If the second character of `f` is equal to the second character of `s`, and the first character of `f` is greater than the value of `d` corresponding to the first character of `s`, 'NO' is printed. However, if either `f[1]` is not equal to `s[1]` or `f[0]` is less than or equal to `d[s[0]]`, 'NO' is printed. In both cases, the variables `coz`, `f`, and `s` are updated based on the input values, and the program either prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, assigns values to variables `coz`, `f`, and `s` based on the input, and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If the second character of `f` is equal to `coz` and the second character of `s` is not equal to `coz`, it prints 'YES'. If the second character of `f` is not equal to `coz` and the second character of `s` is equal to `coz`, it prints 'NO'. If the second character of `f` is equal to the second character of `s`, and the first character of `f` is greater than the corresponding value of `d` for the first character of `s`, it prints 'YES'. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and the output is based solely on user input and the defined conditions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
