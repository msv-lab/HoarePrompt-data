Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the rules of the card game "Durak" as described in the problem description. It checks the trump suit, compares the ranks and suits of the two cards, and determines whether the first card beats the second card or not. The conditions in the if-else blocks accurately reflect the rules of the game, ensuring that the correct output ("YES" or "NO") is printed based on the comparison of the cards.

The program handles all possible scenarios outlined in the problem description, such as when the second card has a different suit from the trump suit, when the first card has a different suit from the trump suit, and when the two cards have the same suit but different ranks.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
