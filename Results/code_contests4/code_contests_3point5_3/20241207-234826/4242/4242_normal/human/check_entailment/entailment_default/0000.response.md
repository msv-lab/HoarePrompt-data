Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes four integer numbers as input and the sequence of operations to be performed on them. It then calculates all possible permutations of the numbers and evaluates different expressions to find the minimum result. The code follows the problem description accurately by considering all possible combinations of the given numbers and operations to find the smallest number that can be obtained. The output hints also support the fact that the code correctly evaluates expressions and finds the minimal result as required. Since the code covers all potential cases and aligns with the problem description, the correctness is True.
