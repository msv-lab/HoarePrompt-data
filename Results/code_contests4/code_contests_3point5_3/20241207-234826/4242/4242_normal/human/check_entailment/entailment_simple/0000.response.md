Correctness: **True**

The program reads four integer numbers a, b, c, d and a sequence of operations from the input. It then iterates through all permutations of the four numbers and calculates the result of applying the operations in the given sequence. It keeps track of the minimum result obtained and finally prints the minimum result.

The program follows the problem description accurately by considering all possible permutations of the four numbers and applying the operations in the correct sequence. It calculates the minimum result correctly and outputs it as required. Hence, the program is correct.
