Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes four integer numbers as input and a sequence of operations, then generates all permutations of the numbers to calculate the minimum result obtained from evaluating different expressions with the given sequence of operations. Finally, it prints the minimum result. The program ensures that the correct output is obtained according to the problem description for all potential cases.
