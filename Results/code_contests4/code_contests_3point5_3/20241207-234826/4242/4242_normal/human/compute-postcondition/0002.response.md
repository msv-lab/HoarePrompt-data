Example Answer:
`z` is assigned the list of strings obtained by splitting the input received from `raw_input()`. The value of `res` is not affected, and `a` is a list of strings after splitting the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is assigned a very large value, `a` is a list of strings after splitting the input, `z` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`res` is assigned a very large value, `a` is a list of strings after splitting the input, `z` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
