Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes two inputs of strings representing integers `a` and `z`, and performs all permutations of `a` to calculate the minimum result from evaluating different expressions. The expressions consist of a sequence of operations (+ or *) between the integers in `a` and `z`. The function then prints the minimum result obtained from these expressions.**
