Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input after splitting it. The previous value of `res` is unknown and not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is assigned a very large value, `a` is a list of strings after splitting the input.
Output State: **`res` is assigned a very large value, `a` is a list of strings after splitting the input**
