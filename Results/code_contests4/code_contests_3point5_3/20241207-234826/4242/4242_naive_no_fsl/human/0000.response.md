Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input integers and sequence of operations. It then computes all permutations of the input numbers and evaluates the expressions based on the given sequence of operations. It finds the minimum result and outputs it, which aligns with the problem description. The use of permutations and eval function covers all possible combinations and operations, ensuring that the smallest number is obtained. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
