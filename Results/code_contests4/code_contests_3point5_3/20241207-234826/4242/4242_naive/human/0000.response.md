Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly solves the problem described. It takes four integer numbers and a sequence of operations as input, then iterates through all permutations of the numbers and evaluates the expression based on the given sequence of operations. It finds the minimum result that can be obtained from the original numbers by the given sequence of operations. The program uses the itertools module to generate permutations and eval function to evaluate the expressions.

For all the given examples in the problem description, the program produces the correct output:
- For the input "1 1 1 1" and sequence of operations "+ + *", the output is 3, which is the correct minimal result.
- For the input "2 2 2 2" and sequence of operations "* * +", the output is 8, which is the correct minimal result.
- For the input "1 2 3 4" and sequence of operations "* + +", the output is 9, which is the correct minimal result.

Since the program works correctly for all the provided examples and there are no edge cases mentioned where it fails to produce the expected output, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
