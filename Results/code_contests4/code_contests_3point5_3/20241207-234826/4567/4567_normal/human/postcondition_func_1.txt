The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters but relies on the constraints that the integers `a` and `b` should be such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000. It processes the `kwargs` dictionary to handle printing values to a stream or `sys.stdout`. The function iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to the file with the specified separator. It then writes the specified end character to the file and flushes the file if the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs` with a value of True. The function does not explicitly return any output but performs printing operations based on the provided constraints.
