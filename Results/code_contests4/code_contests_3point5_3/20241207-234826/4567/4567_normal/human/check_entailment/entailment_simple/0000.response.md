Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description. It first generates all Pythagorean triplets with integer coordinates and then checks if there exists a triplet where the given legs can be formed. If such a triplet exists, it outputs the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle as required. If no such triplet is found, it outputs "NO" as specified in the problem description.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the expected output based on the problem description.
