You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a right triangle with legs of length a and b. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to locate the triangle on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. All the vertices must have integer coordinates. If there exists such a location, you have to output the appropriate coordinates of vertices.

Input

The first line contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000), separated by a single space.

Output

In the first line print either "YES" or "NO" (without the quotes) depending on whether the required location exists. If it does, print in the next three lines three pairs of integers — the coordinates of the triangle vertices, one pair per line. The coordinates must be integers, not exceeding 109 in their absolute value.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000.**
def func_1():
    trips = []
    for i in range(1, 1001):
        for j in range(1, 1001):
            k = (i ** 2 + j ** 2) ** 0.5
            if k.is_integer():
                k = int(k)
                trips.append([i, j, k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains all possible Pythagorean triplets [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers. If no triplets are found, trips remains an empty list.
    a, b = get_list()
    for (i, j, k) in trips:
        if a % k == 0 and b % k == 0:
            mul1 = a // k
            mul2 = b // k
            if i * mul1 != mul2 * j:
                func_2('YES')
                func_2(0, 0)
                func_2(j * mul1, i * mul1)
                func_2(-i * mul2, j * mul2)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, trips contains all possible Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`. If `a % k == 0` and `b % k == 0`, and for all triplets in trips, `i * mul1` is equal to `mul2 * j`, then no specific value is returned.
    func_2('NO')

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000.**
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, 'args' has been completely iterated over and all elements have been written to the file.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, 'args' has been completely iterated over and all elements have been written to the file. The file now contains a newline character at the end. The 'flush' key has been popped from 'kwargs' and its value is True if present.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
