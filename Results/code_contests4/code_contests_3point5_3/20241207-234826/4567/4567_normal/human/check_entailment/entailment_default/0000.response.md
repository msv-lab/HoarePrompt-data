The given Python program seems to be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program aims to determine whether it is possible to locate a right triangle with legs of length a and b on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. All the vertices must have integer coordinates.
2. The `func_1` function iterates over all possible Pythagorean triplets within the given range of integers and checks specific conditions involving the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. If these conditions are met, it calls `func_2` with different arguments but does not return any specific value.
3. The conditions checked in `func_1` include verifying if the sides of the right triangle with lengths `a` and `b` are divisible by the Pythagorean triplet found and if the vertices of the triangle have integer coordinates.
4. The program does not handle the case where one of the legs of the triangle is 1, which is a potential edge case that is not covered by the current implementation.
5. The output hints do not provide any additional insights that would contradict the code, but they do not cover this edge case either.
6. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
