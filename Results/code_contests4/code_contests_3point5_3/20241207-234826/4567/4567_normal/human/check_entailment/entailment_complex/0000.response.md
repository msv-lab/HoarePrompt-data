Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly determines whether it is possible to locate a right triangle with legs of length a and b such that none of its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. It iterates over all possible Pythagorean triplets within the given range of integers and checks specific conditions involving the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. If the conditions are met, it outputs the appropriate coordinates of the triangle vertices. The code annotations provide insights into the state of the program before and after function calls, helping to understand the flow of the program. The code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases appropriately.
