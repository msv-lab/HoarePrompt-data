According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `trips`, `mul1`, `mul2`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least two Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`. If `a % k == 0` and `b % k == 0`, and `i * mul1` is not equal to `mul2 * j`, the function returns the result of calling func_2 with the argument 'YES'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next triplet in `trips` should be considered. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least three Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`**.
