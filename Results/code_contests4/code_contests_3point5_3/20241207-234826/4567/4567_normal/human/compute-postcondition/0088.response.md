Postcondition: ***`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least three Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of 1000 divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`. If `a` is divisible by `k` and `b` is divisible by `k`, then if i * `mul1` is not equal to `mul2` * j, no specific value is returned. Otherwise, no changes occur in the values of the variables.***
