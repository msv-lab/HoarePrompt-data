Example Answer:
The function func_2 is called with the arguments `j * mul1` and `i * mul1`. The values of `j`, `i`, and `mul1` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will depend on the values of these variables when the function is executed. 
Output State: **The output state will depend on the specific values of `j`, `i`, and `mul1` when the function is executed.**
