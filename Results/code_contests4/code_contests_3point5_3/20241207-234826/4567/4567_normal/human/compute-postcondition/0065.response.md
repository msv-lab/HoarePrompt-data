Example Answer:
`-i * mul2` is passed as the first argument and `j * mul2` is passed as the second argument to the function `func_2`. The specific values of `j`, `i`, and `mul1` are not provided, so the output state will depend on these specific values when the function is executed.
Output State: **The output state will depend on the specific values of `j`, `i`, and `mul1` when the function is executed.**
