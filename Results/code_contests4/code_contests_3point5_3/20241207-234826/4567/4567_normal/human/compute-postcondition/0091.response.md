The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It consists of three cases:

Case 1: The program returns the value of `j` multiplied by the value of `i` stored in `mul1`.

Case 2: The program returns the result of calling func_2 with the argument 'YES'.

Case 3: The program does not return any specific value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to perform calculations based on the values of `i` and `j`, call another function with a specific argument, and perform certain tasks without returning any value.
Functionality: **The function does calculations based on `i` and `j`, calls func_2 with the argument 'YES', and performs certain tasks without returning any specific value.**
