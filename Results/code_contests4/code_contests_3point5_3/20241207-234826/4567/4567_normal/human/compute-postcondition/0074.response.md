Example Answer:
`func_2(j * mul1, i * mul1)` is called with the arguments `j * mul1` and `i * mul1`. The initial values of `j` and `i` are not provided, so the exact values cannot be determined. However, `mul1` is the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`, and `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`. Therefore, the output state is:
`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least two Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`, `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES'.
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least two Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`, `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES'**
