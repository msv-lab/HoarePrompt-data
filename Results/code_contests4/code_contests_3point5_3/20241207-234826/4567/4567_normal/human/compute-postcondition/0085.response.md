Example Answer: 
The function `func_2` is called with the arguments -i * mul2 and j * mul2. The values of i, j, mul2 are not given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least three Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of 1000 divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`.
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least three Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of 1000 divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`**
