Example Answer:
The code snippet removes the 'sep' and 'file' keys from the kwargs dictionary and assigns their values to variables 'sep' and 'file' respectively. If the kwargs dictionary did not contain these keys, the default values ' ' and sys.stdout are used. Since the initial state does not mention the presence of kwargs or its keys, we can assume the default values are used. Therefore, the output state is: 'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 'sep' is ' ' and 'file' is sys.stdout.
Output State: **'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 'sep' is ' ' and 'file' is sys.stdout**
