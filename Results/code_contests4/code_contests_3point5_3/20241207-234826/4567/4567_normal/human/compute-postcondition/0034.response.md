The code appends a new list [i, j, k] to the trips list. Since j is not defined in the initial state, the value of j is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains the new list [i, 1000, k], and a new list [i, j, k] is appended to trips.
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains the new list [i, 1000, k], and a new list [i, j, k] is appended to trips**
