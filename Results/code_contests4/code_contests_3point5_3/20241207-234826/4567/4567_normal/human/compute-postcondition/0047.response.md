Example Answer:
The list `trips` is appended with a new list containing values `[i, j, k]`. Here, `i` is 1001, `j` is not defined, and `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of `1001` and `j+1`. Since `j` is not defined, the value of `k` cannot be calculated accurately. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of `1001` and `j+1`, `i` is 1001, `trips` contains the list `[1001, b, k]` if `k` is an integer.
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of `1001` and `j+1`, `i` is 1001, `trips` contains the list `[1001, b, k]` if `k` is an integer**
