The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the constraints that the integers `a` and `b` should be such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000. The function performs some operations or checks based on these integer values, but does not return any specific output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to perform some operations or checks based on the constraints provided for the integers `a` and `b`.
