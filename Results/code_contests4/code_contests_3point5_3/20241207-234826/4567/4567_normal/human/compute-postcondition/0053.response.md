Postcondition: ***`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of `1001` and `j+1`, `i` is 1001, `trips` contains the list `[1001, b, k, i, j, k]` if `k` is an integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1001. If `k` is an integer, it is converted to an integer and added to the trips list.***
