Example Answer:
The `pop` function removes and returns the value of the 'end' key from the `kwargs` dictionary. If 'end' key is not present in `kwargs`, it returns '\n'. The value returned by `pop` is then written to the file using the `write` method. Since 'end' key is not explicitly provided in the initial state, the default value '\n' is written to the file.
Output State: **'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 'sep' is ' ', 'file' is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, 'args' has been completely iterated over and all elements have been written to the file. The file now contains a newline character at the end.**
