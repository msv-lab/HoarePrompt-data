Postcondition: **`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least two Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`. If `i * mul1` is not equal to `mul2 * j`, the program returns the result of calling func_2 with the argument 'YES'.**
