Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, trips contains all possible Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`. If `a % k == 0` and `b % k == 0`, and for all triplets in trips, `i * mul1` is equal to `mul2 * j`, then no specific value is returned.**
