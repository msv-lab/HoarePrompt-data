According to the code, the loop will execute for the next iteration as long as `i` is less than 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer, and the loop variable `i` is 1000. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `i` needs to be incremented beyond 1000. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer, for the loop to execute one more time `i` will be 1001**
