Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by the function `get_list()`. The values of `a` and `b` are both 1000. The variables `k` and `trips` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains all possible Pythagorean triplets [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers. If no triplets are found, trips remains an empty list.
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains all possible Pythagorean triplets [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers. If no triplets are found, trips remains an empty list.**
