According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than 1001. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is a float that is an integer, and `trips` contains a new list [i, j, k] where `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. Since the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to 1000, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, the state should be:
State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is a float that is an integer, `trips` contains a new list [i, j+1, k] where `i`, `j+1`, and `k` are integers**
