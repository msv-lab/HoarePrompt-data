Example Answer:
`mul1` is assigned the floor division result of `a` divided by `k`. Since `a` is 1000 and `k` is an integer, the value of `mul1` will be the floor division result of 1000 divided by `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least three Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of 1000 divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`.
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is 1000, `k` is an integer, `trips` contains at least three Pythagorean triplets, `mul1` is the floor division result of 1000 divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division result of `b` divided by `k`**
