Output State: `a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of `1001` and `j+1`, `i` is 1001, `trips` contains the list `[1001, b, k]` if `k` is an integer, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1001. `k` is converted to an integer.
