According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to 1000 inclusive. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be equal to 1001. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer, `i` is 1001.
State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer, `i` is 1001 for the loop to execute one more time**
