Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j+1`, where `i` is 1001. The value of `j` is not given, so the value of `k` cannot be determined. The list `trips` contains `[1001, b, k]` only if `k` is an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of `i` and `j+1`, `i` is 1001, `trips` contains the list `[1001, b, k]` if `k` is an integer.
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of `i` and `j+1`, `i` is 1001, `trips` contains the list `[1001, b, k]` if `k` is an integer**
