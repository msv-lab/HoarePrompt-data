According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is a float that is an integer, and `trips` contains a new list [i, j, k]. Since `j` is part of the range from 1 to 1000, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1000 so `j` should be 1000. 
State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is a float that is an integer, `trips` contains a new list [i, 1000, k]**
