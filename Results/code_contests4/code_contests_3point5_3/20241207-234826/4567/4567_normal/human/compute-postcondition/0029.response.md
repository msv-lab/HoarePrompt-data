Example Answer:
A new list [i, j, k] is appended to the trips list. The values of i, j, and k are not given in the initial state, so after execution, the trips list contains the new list [i, j, k].
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is a float that is an integer, `trips` contains a new list [i, j, k]**
