Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 'sep' is ' ' and 'file' is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **'a' and 'b' are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 'sep' is ' ' and 'file' is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True**
