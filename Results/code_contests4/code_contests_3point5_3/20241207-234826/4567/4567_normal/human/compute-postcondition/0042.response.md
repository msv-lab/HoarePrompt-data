Example Answer:
The list `trips` appends a new list containing the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The values of `i` and `j` are 1001 and `b` respectively. The value of `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and `b`, which is an integer. Therefore, after execution, the new list `[1001, b, k]` is appended to `trips`.
Output State: **`a` is 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of `i` and `j`, `i` is 1001 for the loop to execute one more time, `trips` contains the list `[1001, b, k]`**
