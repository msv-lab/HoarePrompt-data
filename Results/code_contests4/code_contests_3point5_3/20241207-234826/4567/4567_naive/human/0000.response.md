Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly determines whether it is possible to locate a right triangle with legs of length a and b on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. It checks for all possible integer coordinates and calculates the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by those coordinates. If the hypotenuse is an integer and divides both a and b, then it outputs the coordinates of the vertices. The program also handles the case where no such location exists and outputs "NO". Overall, the program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output.
