Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly determines whether it is possible to locate a right triangle with legs of length a and b on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. It iterates through all possible integer coordinates for the vertices of the triangle and checks if the sides are not parallel to the coordinate axes. The logic for checking the existence of such a location and outputting the coordinates of the vertices seems to be correct based on the problem description. Additionally, the program handles cases where a and b are both equal, as well as cases where a and b are different, as shown in the example outputs provided in the problem description. Overall, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
