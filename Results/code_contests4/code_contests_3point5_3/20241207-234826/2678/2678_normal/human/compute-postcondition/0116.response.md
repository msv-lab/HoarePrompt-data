Example Answer:
The list `qq` is initialized as an empty list. This operation doesn't affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains maximum distance value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain initial conditions, `q` contains coordinates of empty squares with updated distances for the loop to execute again `q` is not empty, `qq` is an empty list.
Output State: **`grid` updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains maximum distance value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain initial conditions, `q` contains coordinates of empty squares with updated distances for the loop to execute again `q` is not empty, `qq` is an empty list**
