Postcondition: ***grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. If grid[i][j] == '#', q contains the appended coordinates [i+2, j+2], H, W, dist, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute W is greater than 1, and grid at index [i+2][j+2] is 0. If grid[i][j] != '#', no changes occur in the state of the program.***
