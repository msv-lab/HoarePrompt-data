Example Answer:
The value of grid[i][j] is updated to 0. The value of i is incremented by the total number of black squares in the grid plus 1, and the value of j is increased by 1. Additionally, the coordinates [i, j] are appended to the list q. Therefore, the Output State is: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, i is incremented by total number of black squares + 1, j is increased by 1, [i, j] is appended to list q.
Output State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, i is incremented by total number of black squares + 1, j is increased by 1, [i, j] is appended to list q**
