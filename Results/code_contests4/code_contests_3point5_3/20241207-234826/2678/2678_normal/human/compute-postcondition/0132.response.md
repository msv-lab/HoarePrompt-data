Example Answer:
Appending the coordinates `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The previous values of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c`, `q`, `i`, `j` remain the same, and `qq` appends a list containing the coordinates `[r, c]`.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c`, `q`, `i`, `j` remain the same, `qq` appends a list containing the coordinates `[r, c]`**
