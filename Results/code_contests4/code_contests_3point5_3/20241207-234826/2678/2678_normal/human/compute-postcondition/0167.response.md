Example Answer:
`maxx` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`. The value of `maxx` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, and there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over with an additional coordinate `[r, c]` in the list `qq` if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.' for the next iteration.
