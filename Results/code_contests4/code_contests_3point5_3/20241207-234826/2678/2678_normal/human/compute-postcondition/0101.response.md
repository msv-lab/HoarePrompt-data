Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square. `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`. `i` is the last value of `r`. `j` is the last value of `c`. `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances. There are no more coordinates in `q`. `r` is between 0 and `H`. `c` is between 0 and `W`. The element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.'. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more coordinates in `q`. Additionally, if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] is '.', then after the if part executes, [r, c] is appended to `qq`, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the previous `maxx` and the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid`, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances including the newly appended [r, c], and there are no more coordinates in `q`.***
