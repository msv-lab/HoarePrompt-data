According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `q` which contains coordinates. If there are more coordinates in `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum distance value, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains coordinates of all empty squares, `q` is empty, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.'. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more coordinates in `q`. 
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square, `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances, there are no more coordinates in `q`, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.', for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more coordinates in `q**`.
