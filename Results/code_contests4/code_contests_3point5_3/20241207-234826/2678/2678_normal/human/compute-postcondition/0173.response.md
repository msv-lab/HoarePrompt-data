According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the list `q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, there are no more coordinates left in the list `q` to iterate over, and `q` is now assigned the value of `qq`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, you need to reassign `q` to the value of `qq`.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `grid` is updated with minimum distances for all valid coordinates where the element is '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, `q` is now assigned the value of `qq` for the loop to execute again**
