Example Answer:
The coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to the list `qq`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `qq` contains the appended coordinates `[r, c]`.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `qq` contains the appended coordinates `[r, c]`**
