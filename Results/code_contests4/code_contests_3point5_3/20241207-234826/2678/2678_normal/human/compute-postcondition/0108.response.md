Example Answer:
The value at position `[r][c]` in the `grid` is updated to be the value at position `[i][j]` in the `grid` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum distance, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains coordinates with updated distances including [r, c], and there are more coordinates in `q`.**
