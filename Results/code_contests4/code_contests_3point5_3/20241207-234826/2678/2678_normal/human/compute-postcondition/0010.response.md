According to the code, the loop will execute H times, where H is greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as H is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, H is greater than 0, W is the length of the first row of the grid, and dist is a list of empty lists with length H. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that H is greater than 0, i is 0 (the first iteration), and the grid has at least one black square. 
State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, H is greater than 0, W is the length of the first row of the grid, dist is a list of empty lists with length H, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
