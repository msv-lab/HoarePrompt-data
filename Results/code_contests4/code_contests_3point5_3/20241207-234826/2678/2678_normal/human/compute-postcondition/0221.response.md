`[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq`. The variable `maxx` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is updated with the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **`maxx` is updated with the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`**
