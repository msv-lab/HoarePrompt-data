Output State: **After the if statement executes, `grid` is updated with minimum distances for all valid coordinates where the element is '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `q`, `qq` remain the same, `r` and `c` are valid values within the specified ranges, `grid[r][c]` is updated with a '.', and `maxx` is updated with the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next coordinate [r, c] must be valid within the specified ranges, the element in the `grid` at that coordinate should be updated with a '.', and `maxx` should be updated accordingly**
