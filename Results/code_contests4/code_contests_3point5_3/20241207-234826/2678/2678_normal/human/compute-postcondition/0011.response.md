According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `j` is within the range of `W`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `W` must be greater than 0. 

Before the loop starts, the grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, H is greater than 0, W is the length of the first row of the grid, dist is a list of empty lists with length H, and i is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, H is greater than 0, W is the length of the first row of the grid and W is greater than 0, dist is a list of empty lists with length H, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
