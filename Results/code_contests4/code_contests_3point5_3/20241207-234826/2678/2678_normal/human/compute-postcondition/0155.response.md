Postcondition: ***`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value based on the conditions, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over, coordinates `[i + 1, j]`, `[i - 1, j]`, `[i, j + 1]`, `[i, j - 1]` are valid within the grid dimensions. Additionally, `r` is within the range `0 <= r < H`, `c` is within the range `0 <= c < W`, and the element in the grid at position `[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
