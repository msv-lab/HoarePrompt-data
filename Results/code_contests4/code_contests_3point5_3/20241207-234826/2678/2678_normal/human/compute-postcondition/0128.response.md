Postcondition: ***`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same. The coordinates `[r, c]` are valid and within the range of the grid, and the element at those coordinates is equal to '.', `qq` appends a list containing the coordinates `[r, c]` if the conditions are met.***
