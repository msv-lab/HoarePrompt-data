Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, which contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square. `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`. `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain their initial conditions. `q` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances.
