Example Answer:
The element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is updated to be one more than the element at position `i`,`j`. Additionally, `maxx` is updated, `i` is now `r`, `j` is now `c`. The conditions for the loop to execute one more time are also stated. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is updated, `maxx` is updated, `i` is now `r`, `j` is now `c`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more coordinates in `q`, `r` is between 0 and H, `c` is between 0 and W, and the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.'.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is updated, `maxx` is updated, `i` is now `r`, `j` is now `c`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more coordinates in `q`, `r` is between 0 and H, `c` is between 0 and W, and the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.'**
