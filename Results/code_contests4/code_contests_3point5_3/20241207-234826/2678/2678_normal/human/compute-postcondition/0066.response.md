According to the code, the loop can execute again if the new coordinates (r, c) fall within the boundaries of the grid and the grid value at that position is '.'. 
At the end of the last iteration, the grid still has at least one black square replaced with 0, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` remain unchanged. `maxx` has been updated to the maximum value between the initial `maxx` and the grid value at the previous coordinates [r, c]. `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c] if the conditions are met.

So for the loop to execute one more time, the new coordinates (r, c) must fall within the grid boundaries and the grid value at that position must be '.'.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square where all black squares ('#') have been replaced with 0, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain their initial conditions. `maxx` is the maximum value between the initial `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`. `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c] if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.' for the next iteration**
