Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the elements in `grid` that satisfy the conditions, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, there are no more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over**
