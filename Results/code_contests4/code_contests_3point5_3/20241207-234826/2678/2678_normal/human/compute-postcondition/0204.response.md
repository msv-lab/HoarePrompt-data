Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `r` and `c` are used for the next set of coordinates. `maxx` may be updated with the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. `qq` is updated with valid coordinates if the conditions are satisfied and the list `[r, c]` is appended to `qq` if `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c] == '.'`.***
