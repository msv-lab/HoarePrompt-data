Postcondition: ***grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. If grid[i][j] == '#', then grid[i][j] is replaced by 0. The value of i is incremented by the total number of black squares in the grid plus 1, the value of j is 1 more than its initial condition, and [i, j] is appended to the list q. For the loop to execute one more time, j must be less than W.***
