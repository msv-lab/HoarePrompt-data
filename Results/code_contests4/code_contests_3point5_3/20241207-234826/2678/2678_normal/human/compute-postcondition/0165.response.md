According to the code, the loop can execute based on the coordinates `[r, c]` in the list that meet the conditions `0 <= r < H`, `0 <= c < W`, and `grid[r][c] == '.'`. Since there is an additional coordinate `[r, c]` in the list `qq` to iterate over, for the loop to execute one more time, the next coordinates in the list `q` need to satisfy the conditions mentioned above.

State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, and there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over with an additional coordinate `[r, c]` in the list `qq` if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.' for the next iteration**
