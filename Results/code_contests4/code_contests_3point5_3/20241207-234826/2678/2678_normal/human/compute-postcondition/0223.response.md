According to the code, the loop iterates through the coordinates [r, c] based on the given conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, the next coordinate [r, c] must be valid within the specified ranges, the element in the `grid` at that coordinate should be updated with a '.', and `maxx` should be updated accordingly.

At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions are met as described. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **After the if statement executes, `grid` is updated with minimum distances for all valid coordinates where the element is '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `q`, `qq` remain the same, the next coordinate [r, c] must be valid within the specified ranges, the element in the `grid` at that coordinate should be updated with a '.', and `maxx` should be updated accordingly**
