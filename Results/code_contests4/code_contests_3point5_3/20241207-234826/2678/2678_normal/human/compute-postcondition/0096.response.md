According to the code, the loop can execute if there are more coordinates in `q`. Before the loop starts, the condition to execute the loop one more time is that there must be more coordinates in `q`. So, the state needs to be adjusted to have more coordinates in `q` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square, `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances, there are no more coordinates in `q`, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.', for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more coordinates in `q**.
