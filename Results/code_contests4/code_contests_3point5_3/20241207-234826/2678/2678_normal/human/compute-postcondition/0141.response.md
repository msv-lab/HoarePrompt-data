Postcondition: ***`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the elements at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid` that satisfy the conditions, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, all valid coordinates `[r, c]` where 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and the element at `grid[r][c]` is '.' have been appended to the list `qq`, for the loop to execute one more time, there are more elements in the list `q`. Additionally, if the condition (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.')) is true, `[r, c]` has been appended to the list `qq`.***
