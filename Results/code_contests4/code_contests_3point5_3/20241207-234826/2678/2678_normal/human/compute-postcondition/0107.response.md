According to the code, the loop will execute for each set of coordinates in the list [[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum distance, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains coordinates with updated distances including [r, c], and there are more coordinates in `q`. 

For the next iteration to occur, the loop will need to be executed for the next set of coordinates in the list. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum distance, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains coordinates with updated distances including [r, c], and there are more coordinates in `q`.**
