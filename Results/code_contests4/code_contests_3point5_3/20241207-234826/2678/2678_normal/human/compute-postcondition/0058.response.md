Example Answer:
The list `qq` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square where all black squares ('#') have been replaced with 0, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, and `j` maintain their initial conditions, `maxx` is 0, `qq` is an empty list.
Output State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square where all black squares ('#') have been replaced with 0, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, and `j` maintain their initial conditions, `maxx` is 0, `qq` is an empty list**
