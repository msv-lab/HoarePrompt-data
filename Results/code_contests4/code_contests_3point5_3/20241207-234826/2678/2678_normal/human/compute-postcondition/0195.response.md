Postcondition: ***After the if condition, `grid` is updated with minimum distances for all valid coordinates where the element is '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `q` remain the same, `qq` contains all valid coordinates where the element is '.', `r` and `c` are valid values within the specified ranges, `grid[r][c]` is updated with a '.', and `maxx` is updated with the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, for the loop to execute one more time the next valid coordinate in `q` must be considered with updated values of `i` and `j. Additionally, `r` is within the range 0 <= r < H, `c` is within the range 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is '.'***
