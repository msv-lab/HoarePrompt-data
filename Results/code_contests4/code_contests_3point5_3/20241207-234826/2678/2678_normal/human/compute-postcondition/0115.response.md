According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum distance value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` are maintained with their initial conditions, and `q` contains coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances. Since `q` is not empty, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`grid` updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains maximum distance value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain initial conditions, `q` contains coordinates of empty squares with updated distances for the loop to execute again `q` is not empty**
