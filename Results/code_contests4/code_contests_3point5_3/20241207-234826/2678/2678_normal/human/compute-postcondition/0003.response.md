According to the code, the loop will execute H times, where H is the length of the grid. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as H is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `H` is greater than 0, i is 0, and the first row of the grid contains at least one black square.
State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, H is greater than 0, W is the length of the first row of the grid, dist is a list of 0s with length H, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0**
