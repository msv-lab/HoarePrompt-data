Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `[r, c]` are coordinates, where 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'. `maxx` may be updated based on the new values of `r` and `c`. `qq` is updated with valid coordinates for the next iteration, and if the conditions are met, `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`.***
