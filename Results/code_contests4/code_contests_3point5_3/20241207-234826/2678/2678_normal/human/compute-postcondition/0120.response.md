Example Answer:
The element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid` is updated to the value of the element at coordinates `i` and `j` in `grid` plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains maximum distance value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c` maintain initial conditions, `q` contains coordinates of empty squares with updated distances and is not empty, `qq` is an empty list, `i` and `j` are set according to the first coordinates in `q`. `r` is within the range of 0 to `H`, `c` is within the range of 0 to `W`, and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid` is equal to '.'.
Output State: **`grid` updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains maximum distance value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c` maintain initial conditions, `q` contains coordinates of empty squares with updated distances and is not empty, `qq` is an empty list, `i` and `j` are set according to the first coordinates in `q`. `r` is within the range of 0 to `H`, `c` is within the range of 0 to `W`, and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid` is equal to '.'**
