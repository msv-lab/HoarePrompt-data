Example Answer:
The coordinates [i, j] are appended to the list q. The values of i and j are both incremented by 1 before the append operation. Therefore, after execution, the coordinates [i+1, j+1] are added to the list q.
Output State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, q contains the appended coordinates [i+1, j+1], H, W, dist, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute W is greater than 0**
