Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the elements at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid` that satisfy the conditions, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same. All valid coordinates `[r, c]` where 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and the element at `grid[r][c]` is '.' have been appended to the list `qq`. The loop has processed all valid coordinates in the grid where the element is '.', and `maxx` contains the maximum value after all iterations of the loop have finished.**
