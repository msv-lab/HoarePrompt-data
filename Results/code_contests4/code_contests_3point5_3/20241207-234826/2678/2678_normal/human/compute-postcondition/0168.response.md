Example Answer:
`qq` is appended with the coordinate `[r, c]`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, and there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over with an additional coordinate `[r, c]` in the list `qq`.
