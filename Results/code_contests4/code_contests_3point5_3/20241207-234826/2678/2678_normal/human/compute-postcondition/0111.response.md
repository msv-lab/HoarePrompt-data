Postcondition: ***`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum distance between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `i` represents the last value of `r`, `j` represents the last value of `c`, `qq` contains coordinates with updated distances including [r, c], and there are more coordinates in `q`. Additionally, [r, c] is appended to `qq` if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.'.***
