Example Answer:
The value at coordinate `[r, c]` in the `grid` is updated to be one greater than the value at coordinate `[i, j]`. The coordinates `r` and `c` must satisfy the conditions `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c] == '.'` for this update to occur. The variables `maxx`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, and there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over with an additional coordinate `[r, c]` in the list `qq` if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.' for the next iteration.
