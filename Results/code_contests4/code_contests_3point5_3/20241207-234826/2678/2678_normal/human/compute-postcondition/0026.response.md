According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range of `W`, so the loop will execute as long as `W` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the grid contains at least one black square, indicating that `W` is greater than 0. The loop will replace a black square with 0 and modify several variables. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` maintains its initial condition, for the loop to execute `W` is greater than 0**
