The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `grid`, which is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. Each character in the grid is either '#' or '.'. After executing the function body, the program returns the maximum distance value stored in 'grid' after updating it with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to calculate the maximum distance value in the grid after updating it with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square.
