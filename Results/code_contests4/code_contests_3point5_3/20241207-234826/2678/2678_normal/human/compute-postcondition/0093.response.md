Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `grid` is updated with the value of `grid[r][c] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the current `maxx` value and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, `i` is now `r`, `j` is now `c`, there must be more coordinates in `q` for the loop to execute one more time, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.', `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c], and [r, c] is appended to `qq`. If 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid` is updated with the value of `grid[r][c] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the current `maxx` value and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, `i` is now `r`, `j` is now `c`, there must be more coordinates in `q` for the loop to execute one more time, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.', `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c], and [r, c] is appended to `qq`.***
