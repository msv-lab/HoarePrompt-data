According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `q` is not empty. Right before the loop, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares, so as long as there is at least one black square, the loop can execute. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the initial conditions.
State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square where all black squares ('#') have been replaced with 0, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, and `j` maintain their initial conditions, and `maxx` is 0**
