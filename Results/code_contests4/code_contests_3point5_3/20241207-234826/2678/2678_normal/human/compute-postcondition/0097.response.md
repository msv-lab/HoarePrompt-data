Postcondition: ***After the if condition, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square, `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances, there are no more coordinates in `q`, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.', for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more coordinates in `q`, 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] is '.'***
