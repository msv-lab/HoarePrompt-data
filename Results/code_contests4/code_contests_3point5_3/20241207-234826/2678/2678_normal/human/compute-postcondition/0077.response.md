According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `q`. If there are still coordinates in `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares where the black squares ('#') have been replaced with the minimum distance from the black square to each empty square. `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain their initial conditions. `maxx` is the maximum value of the distances stored in `grid`. `qq` is a list containing the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more coordinates in `q`.
