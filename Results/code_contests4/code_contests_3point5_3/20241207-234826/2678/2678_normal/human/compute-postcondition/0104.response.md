Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum value between the current value of `maxx` and the distance stored in `grid[r][c]`. This ensures that `maxx` always contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the if-else block executes, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square, `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances including the newly appended [r, c], there are more coordinates in `q`.
