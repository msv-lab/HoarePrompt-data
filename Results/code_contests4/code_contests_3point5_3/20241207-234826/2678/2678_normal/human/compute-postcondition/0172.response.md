Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `grid` is updated with minimum distances for all valid coordinates where the element is '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, there are no more coordinates left in the list `q` to iterate over, `q` is now assigned the value of `qq`.**
