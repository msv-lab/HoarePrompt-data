Example Answer:
`maxx` is assigned the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`. The previous value of `maxx` is unknown, so the new value of `maxx` depends on the element at `grid[r][c]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same. `qq` appends a list containing the coordinates `[r, c]` if the conditions are met.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same. `qq` appends a list containing the coordinates `[r, c]` if the conditions are met.**
