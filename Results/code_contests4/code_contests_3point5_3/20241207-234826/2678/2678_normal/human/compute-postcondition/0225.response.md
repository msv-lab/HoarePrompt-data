Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the element at the coordinate [r, c] in the grid. The element at the coordinate [r, c] is '.', so if the current `maxx` value is less than the ASCII value of '.', then `maxx` will be updated to the ASCII value of '.'. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **After updating grid at coordinate [r, c], the element is '.', `maxx` is updated accordingly, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `q`, `qq` remain the same**
