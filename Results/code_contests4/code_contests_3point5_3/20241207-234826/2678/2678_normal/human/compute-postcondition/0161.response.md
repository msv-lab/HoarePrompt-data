Example Answer:
The value of `grid[r][c]` is updated to be the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. The other variables remain the same and there are still more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element in grid at position `[r][c]`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element in grid at position `[r][c]`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over**
