According to the code, the loop executes for each set of coordinates in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the next set of coordinates `[r, c]` needs to be considered. 
At the end of the last iteration, `r` and `c` are used for the next set of coordinates, `maxx` may be updated with the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` is updated with valid coordinates based on certain conditions, and `[r, c]` is appended to `qq` if specific conditions are satisfied. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **After the execution of the if else block, the next set of coordinates `[r, c]` should be considered, `maxx` may be updated based on the new values of `r` and `c`, `qq` should be updated with valid coordinates for the next iteration, and `[r, c]` should be appended to `qq` if the conditions are met.**
