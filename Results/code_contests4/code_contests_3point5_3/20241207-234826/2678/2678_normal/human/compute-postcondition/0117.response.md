According to the code, the loop can execute if `q` is not empty, meaning there are coordinates in the list. The loop will iterate through each coordinate `(i, j)` in `q`. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **`grid` updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains maximum distance value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c` maintain initial conditions, `q` contains coordinates of empty squares with updated distances for the loop to execute again and is not empty, `qq` is an empty list, `i` and `j` are set according to the first coordinates in `q`**
