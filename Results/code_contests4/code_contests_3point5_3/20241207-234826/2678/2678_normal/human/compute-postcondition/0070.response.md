Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square where all black squares ('#') have been replaced with 0. `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain their initial conditions. `maxx` is the maximum value between the initial `maxx` and the updated values in `grid`. If the condition 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.' is met, `grid` has been updated with the value of `grid[i][j] + 1` at position [r][c], `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the initial `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c] if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.', [r, c] has been appended to `qq`.***
