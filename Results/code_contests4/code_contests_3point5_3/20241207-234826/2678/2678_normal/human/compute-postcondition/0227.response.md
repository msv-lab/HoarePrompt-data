Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, `grid` is updated with minimum distances for all valid coordinates where the element is '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `q`, `qq` remain the same, the next coordinate [r, c] must be valid within the specified ranges, the element in the `grid` at that coordinate should be updated with a '.', and `maxx` should be updated accordingly. Additionally, a new pair [r, c] is appended to the list `qq`.***
