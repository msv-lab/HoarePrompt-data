Example Answer:
The value at position `[r][c]` in `grid` is updated to be one more than the value at position `[i][j]`, effectively incrementing it by 1. The maximum distance value stored in `maxx` is not affected. The last values of `r` and `c` are updated to be `i` and `j` respectively. The coordinates in `qq` are also updated to include the newly appended coordinate `[r, c]`. There are more coordinates in `q` which are unaffected by this operation.
Output State: **After the if-else block executes, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square. `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`. `i` is the last value of `r`. `j` is the last value of `c`. `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances including the newly appended [r, c]. There are more coordinates in `q`.**
