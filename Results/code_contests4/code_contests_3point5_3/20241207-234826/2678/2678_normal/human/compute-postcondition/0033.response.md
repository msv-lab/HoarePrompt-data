Example Answer:
The value of grid at index [i][j] is assigned 0. The value of i and j both have been incremented by 1, so the new index [i+1][j+1] will be affected. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, q contains the appended coordinates [i+1, j+1], H, W, dist, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute W is greater than 0, grid at index [i+1][j+1] is 0.
Output State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, q contains the appended coordinates [i+1, j+1], H, W, dist, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute W is greater than 0, grid at index [i+1][j+1] is 0**
