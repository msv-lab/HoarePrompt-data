According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more coordinates in `q`. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` had no more coordinates. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be more coordinates in `q`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `q` now contains more coordinates.
State: **After the if-else block executes, `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square. `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`. `i` is the last value of `r`. `j` is the last value of `c`. `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances including the newly appended [r, c]. There are more coordinates in `q`.**
