Example Answer: 
A new coordinate `[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq`. The variables `grid`, `maxx`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, but the list `qq` now contains an additional coordinate `[r, c]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, and there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over, with an additional coordinate `[r, c]` in the list `qq`.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, and there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over, with an additional coordinate `[r, c]` in the list `qq`**
