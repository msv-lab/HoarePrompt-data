According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `H`. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. If a square at coordinates [i, j] is a black square ('#'), it is replaced with 0, and the coordinates [i, j] are appended to the list `q`. The variables `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, and `j` maintain their initial conditions. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
