Example Answer:
The coordinates [r, c] are appended to the list qq. The variables grid and maxx are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated according to loop conditions, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the initial `maxx` and the updated `grid` values, `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c] if conditions are met and the coordinates [r, c] are appended to the list qq.
Output State: **`grid` is updated according to loop conditions, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the initial `maxx` and the updated `grid` values, `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c] if conditions are met and the coordinates [r, c] are appended to the list qq.**
