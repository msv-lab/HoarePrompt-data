Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square where all black squares ('#') have been replaced with 0. `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain their initial conditions. `maxx` is 0, `qq` is an empty list. For the loop to execute the first time `q` is not empty, `(i, j)` is the first element in `q`. If 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.', then the program state satisfies the conditions***
