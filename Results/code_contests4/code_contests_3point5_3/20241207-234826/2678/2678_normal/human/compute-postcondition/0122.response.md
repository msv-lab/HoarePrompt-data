Example Answer: 
The coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to the list `qq`. This means that the values of `r` and `c` are added to the list `qq`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, `r` is within the range of 0 to `H`, `c` is within the range of 0 to `W`, the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid` is equal to '.', coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to the list `qq`.
