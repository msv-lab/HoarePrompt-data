Example Answer:
`maxx` is assigned the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element in `grid` at position `[r][c]`. The value of `maxx` is updated accordingly. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, and there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the updated maximum value, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, there are more coordinates in the list `q` to iterate over**
