Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. If the square at coordinates [i, j] is a black square ('#'), it is replaced with 0, and the coordinates [i, j] are appended to the list `q`. The variables `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, and `j` maintain their initial conditions.***
