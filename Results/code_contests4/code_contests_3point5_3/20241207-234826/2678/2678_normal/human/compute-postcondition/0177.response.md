Postcondition: ***`grid` is updated with minimum distances for all valid coordinates where the element is '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same, `q` is assigned the value of `qq`, `qq` is not empty, valid values are assigned to `r` and `c` for the loop to execute. Additionally, `r` is within the range [0, H), `c` is within the range [0, W) and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
