Postcondition: ***`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the elements at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid` that satisfy the conditions, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same. The next set of valid coordinates to be considered are [[i + 2, j], [i, j], [i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, j - 1]. If 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.', then `qq` appends a new list [r, c].***
