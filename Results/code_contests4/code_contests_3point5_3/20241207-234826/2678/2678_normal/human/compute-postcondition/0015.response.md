Postcondition: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, H is greater than 0, W is the length of the first row of the grid and W is greater than 0, dist is a list of empty lists with length H, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If grid[i][j] == '#', then grid[i][j] is 0, dist is a list of empty lists with length H, i is 0, q contains the coordinates [i, j]**
