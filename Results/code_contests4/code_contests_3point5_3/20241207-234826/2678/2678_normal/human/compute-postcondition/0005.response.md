According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` is greater than 0, `W` is the length of the first row of the grid, `dist` is a list of empty lists with length `H`, `i` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `H`, which means `H` must be greater than 1.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` is greater than 1, `W` is the length of the first row of the grid, `dist` is a list of empty lists with length `H`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is 1**
