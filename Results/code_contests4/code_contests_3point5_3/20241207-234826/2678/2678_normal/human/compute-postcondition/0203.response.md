Example Answer:
`qq` is updated by appending the list `[r, c]`. The values of `r` and `c` are used for the next set of coordinates. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is updated, `r` and `c` are used for the next set of coordinates, `maxx` may be updated with the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` is updated with valid coordinates if conditions are satisfied and the list `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`.
Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated, `r` and `c` are used for the next set of coordinates, `maxx` may be updated with the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` is updated with valid coordinates if conditions are satisfied and the list `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`**
