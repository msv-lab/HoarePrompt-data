Example Answer:
The value of grid at index [i][j] is assigned 0. The previous values of variables i and j are incremented by 1 before this assignment. The condition grid[i+1][j+1] == '#' is not mentioned, so it is assumed that it is not met. Therefore, the Output State is: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, q contains the appended coordinates [i+2, j+2], H, W, dist, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute W is greater than 1, and grid at index [i+2][j+2] is 0, grid at index [i][j] is 0.
Output State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, q contains the appended coordinates [i+2, j+2], H, W, dist, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute W is greater than 1, and grid at index [i+2][j+2] is 0, grid at index [i][j] is 0**
