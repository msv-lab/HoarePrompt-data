Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the elements at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the elements at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same**
