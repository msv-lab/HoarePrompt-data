Postcondition: ***`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `r`, `c`, `q`, `qq`, `i`, `j` remain the same. `r` is within the range of 0 to `H`, `c` is within the range of 0 to `W`, the element at coordinates `r` and `c` in `grid` is equal to '.', and coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to the list `qq`.***
