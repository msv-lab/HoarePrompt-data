Example Answer: 
The variable `maxx` is assigned the value 0. The other variables and the grid remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square where all black squares ('#') have been replaced with 0. The list `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares. The variables `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, and `j` maintain their initial conditions, and `maxx` is 0.
