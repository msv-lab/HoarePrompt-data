Example Answer:
The coordinates [r, c] are appended to the list `qq`. The values of `r` and `c` are now the new values of `i` and `j` respectively. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is updated, `maxx` is updated, `i` is now `r`, `j` is now `c`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more coordinates in `q`, `r` is between 0 and H, `c` is between 0 and W, the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.', `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c].
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is updated, `maxx` is updated, `i` is now `r`, `j` is now `c`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more coordinates in `q`, `r` is between 0 and H, `c` is between 0 and W, the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.', `qq` contains the coordinates [r, c]**
