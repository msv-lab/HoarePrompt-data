Output State: After appending the coordinates [r, c] to `qq`, the updated state is as follows - `grid` is updated with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square, `maxx` contains the maximum distance value stored in `grid`, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains the coordinates of all empty squares with updated distances including the newly appended [r, c], and there are more coordinates in `q`.
**`grid` is updated with minimum distances, `maxx` contains maximum distance, `i` is the last value of `r`, `j` is the last value of `c`, `qq` contains coordinates with updated distances including [r, c], more coordinates in `q`**
