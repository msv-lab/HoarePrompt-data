Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is updated, `maxx` is updated, `i` is now `r`, `j` is now `c`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more coordinates in `q`. Additionally, `r` is between 0 and H, `c` is between 0 and W, and the element at position `r`,`c` in `grid` is '.'***
