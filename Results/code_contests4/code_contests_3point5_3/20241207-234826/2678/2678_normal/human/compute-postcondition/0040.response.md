According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `H`. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains the coordinates of black squares, `H` is the height of the grid, `W` is the width of the grid, `dist` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by the total number of black squares in the grid, and `j` maintains its initial condition. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `H`. Considering `i` is incremented by the total number of black squares in the grid, the new value of `i` should be incremented by the total number of black squares in the grid plus 1. 

State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, q contains the coordinates of black squares, H is the height of the grid, W is the width of the grid, dist remains unchanged, i is incremented by the total number of black squares in the grid plus 1, j maintains its initial condition, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `H`**
