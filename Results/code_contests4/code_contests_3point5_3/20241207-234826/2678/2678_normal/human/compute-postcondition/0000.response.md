Example Answer:
The variables H and W are assigned the length of the grid in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively. The length of the grid can be obtained by taking the length of the grid list itself or the length of the first row of the grid since it is guaranteed to be a 2D list. Therefore, the Output State is: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, H is the length of the grid, W is the length of the first row of the grid.
Output State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, H is the length of the grid, W is the length of the first row of the grid**
