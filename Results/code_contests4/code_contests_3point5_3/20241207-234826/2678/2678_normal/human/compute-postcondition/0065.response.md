Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square where all black squares ('#') have been replaced with 0, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `c` maintain their initial conditions. `maxx` is the maximum value between the initial `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`. `qq` is a list containing the coordinates [r, c] if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.'.***
