Output State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. If a square at coordinates [i, j] is a black square ('#'), it is replaced with 0, and the coordinates [i, j] are appended to the list q. H, W, dist are unchanged, i is incremented by the total number of black squares in the grid, and j maintains its initial condition.**
