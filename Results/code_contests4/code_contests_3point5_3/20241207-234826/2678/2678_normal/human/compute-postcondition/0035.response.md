According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `W`, as well as the conditions related to the grid. If `j` is less than `W`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, if grid[i][j] == '#', q contains the appended coordinates [i+1, j+1], H, W, dist, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute W is greater than 0, and grid at index [i+1][j+1] is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: *grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, if grid[i+1][j+1] == '#', q contains the appended coordinates [i+2, j+2], H, W, dist, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute W is greater than 1, and grid at index [i+2][j+2] is 0*
