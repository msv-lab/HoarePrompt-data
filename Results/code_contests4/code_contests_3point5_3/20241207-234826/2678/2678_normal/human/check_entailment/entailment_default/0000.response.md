Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is supposed to replace white squares with black squares that are adjacent to black squares, but the code seems to calculate the maximum distance from each black square to every empty square in the grid. This is not the intended behavior as per the problem description. The output hints also do not match the code's functionality, further indicating that the code is incorrect. The code does not accurately represent the required operation of turning adjacent white squares to black squares.
