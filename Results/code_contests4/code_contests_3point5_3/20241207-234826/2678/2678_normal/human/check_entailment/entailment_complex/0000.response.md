Correctness: **True**

The annotated program follows the problem description accurately. It initializes a queue `q` with the coordinates of black squares, replaces black squares with 0, and then iterates through the white squares updating their values with the minimum distance from the nearest black square using a breadth-first search approach. Finally, it returns the maximum distance value stored in the grid, which corresponds to the number of operations needed to turn all squares black. The program handles all potential cases as it effectively implements the operation described in the problem statement until all squares are black.
