Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the grid, identifying black squares and adding their coordinates to a queue. It then processes each white square adjacent to a black square, updating the grid with the minimum distance from that white square to a black square. This process is repeated until all white squares have been processed.

The program returns the maximum distance value stored in the grid after updating it with the minimum distances from black squares to each empty square, which corresponds to the number of operations required to turn all squares black.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
