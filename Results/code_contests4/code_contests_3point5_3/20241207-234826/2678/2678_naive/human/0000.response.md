Correctness: **True**

The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. It identifies the black squares, then iterates through the white squares that share a side with a black square and updates their distance from the nearest black square. It keeps track of the maximum distance reached, which corresponds to the number of operations needed. The implementation appears to handle all possible cases and correctly outputs the number of operations required to turn all squares into black.
