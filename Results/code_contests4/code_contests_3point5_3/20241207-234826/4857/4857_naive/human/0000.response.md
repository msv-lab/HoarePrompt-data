Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built using the given cubes. It follows the logic described in the problem statement, where each level of the pyramid consists of a specific number of cubes. The program iterates through the levels of the pyramid, subtracting the number of cubes required for each level from the total given cubes until it's not possible to build the next level. Finally, it prints the maximum possible height of the pyramid. 

The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.
