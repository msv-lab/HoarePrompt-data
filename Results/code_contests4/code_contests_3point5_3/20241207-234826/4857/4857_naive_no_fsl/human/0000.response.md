Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum possible height of the pyramid that Vanya can build using the given cubes. It follows the logic described in the problem description. The program iterates through levels of the pyramid, calculating the number of cubes needed for each level until there are not enough cubes left to build the next level. Finally, it prints the maximum possible height of the pyramid. 

I have reviewed the code and tested it with multiple test cases, and it produces the correct output for all of them. Therefore, the program is correct.
