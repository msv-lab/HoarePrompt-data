Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated by adding the value of `k` to it. Given that the initial value of `i` is 2 and the value of `k` is 3, after execution, `i` will be 5. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is `x - 1`, `i` is 5, `k` is 3, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is `x - 1`, `i` is 5, `k` is 3, `c` is 1**
