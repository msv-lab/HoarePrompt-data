According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `i`, `k`. If `x - (i + k)` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 1. So, in order for the loop to execute the first time, `x - (i + k)` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer within that range, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `c` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be greater than or equal to 1**
