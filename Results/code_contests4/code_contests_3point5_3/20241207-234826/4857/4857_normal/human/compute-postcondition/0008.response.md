Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `k + 1`, where `k` is 1. After execution, `k` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is `x - 1`, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is `x - 1`, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `c` is 1**
