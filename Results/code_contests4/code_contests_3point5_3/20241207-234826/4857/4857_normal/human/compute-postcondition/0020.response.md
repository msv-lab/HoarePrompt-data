Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of the variable `c`. Since there are no operations that affect the values of any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is the remainder after performing a specific operation involving `i` and `k`, `i` is the sum of consecutive integers starting from 1, `k` is the loop control variable, `c` is the number of iterations executed**
