Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. Since `i` is initialized to 0, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer within that range, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer within that range, `i` is 0**
