Example Answer:
k is assigned the value k + 1, where k is 3. After execution, k becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, x is x - 6, i is 5, k is 4, c is 2.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, x is x - 6, i is 5, k is 4, c is 2**
