Example Answer:
The value of `x` is decremented by the value of `i`, which is 5. Given that `x` is initially `x - 1`, the new value of `x` after the operation is `x - 1 - 5 = x - 6`. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is `x - 6`, `i` is 5, `k` is 3, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is `x - 6`, `i` is 5, `k` is 3, `c` is 1**
