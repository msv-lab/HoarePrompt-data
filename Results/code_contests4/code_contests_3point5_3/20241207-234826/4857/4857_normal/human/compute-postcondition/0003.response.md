Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer within that range, `i` is 0, `k` is assigned the value 1, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer within that range, `i` is 0, `k` is assigned the value 1, `c` is 0**
