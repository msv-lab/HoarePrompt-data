Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `k`, where `k` is 1. Since `i` was initially 0, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer within that range, `i` is 1, `k` is 1, `c` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer within that range, `i` is 1, `k` is 1, `c` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be greater than or equal to 1**
