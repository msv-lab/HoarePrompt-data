Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built using the given cubes. It iterates through the levels of the pyramid, starting with the top level consisting of 1 cube and increasing the number of cubes for each subsequent level until there are not enough cubes left to complete the next level. It then prints the number of levels built, which corresponds to the maximum height of the pyramid.

The program follows the problem description by incrementing the number of cubes required for each level in the pyramid and stopping when there are not enough cubes left to complete the next level. It correctly calculates the maximum height of the pyramid in all cases.
