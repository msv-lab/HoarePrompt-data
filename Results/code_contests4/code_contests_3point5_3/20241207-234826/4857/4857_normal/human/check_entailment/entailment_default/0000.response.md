Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built using the given cubes. It follows the problem description where each level of the pyramid requires a specific number of cubes based on the level number. The code iterates through the levels of the pyramid, calculating the total number of cubes used at each level and updating the remaining cubes. The code terminates when there are not enough cubes to build the next level, and it prints the maximum possible height of the pyramid. 

There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the code. Therefore, based on the description and the code implementation, the correctness of the code is True.
