Correctness: **True**

The program reads an integer input, calculates the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built using the given cubes, and prints the result. It follows the problem description accurately by iteratively adding consecutive integers starting from 1 until the remaining number of cubes is less than the sum, then printing the number of iterations executed. This process accurately determines the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built.
