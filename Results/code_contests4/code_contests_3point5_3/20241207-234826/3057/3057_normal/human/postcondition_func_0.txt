The function `func` reads two integer inputs, `steps` and `index`, calculates the values of `left` and `right`, then determines whether `index` is odd or even. If `index` is odd, it prints 1. If `index` is even, it enters a loop to adjust `steps`, `left`, and `right` based on conditions until `(right + left) / 2` equals `index`, then prints the final value of `steps`. The function does not accept any explicit parameters, but it relies on user input for `steps` and `index`.
