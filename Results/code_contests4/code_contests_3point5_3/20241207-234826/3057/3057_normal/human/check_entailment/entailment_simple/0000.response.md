Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem description. The program does not generate the sequence of integers as described in the problem.

The program only prints 1 if the index is odd and prints the value of `steps` otherwise. This is not correct as the program should be generating the sequence of integers based on the given algorithm.

The program does not actually generate the sequence and find the value at the k-th position in the obtained sequence as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
