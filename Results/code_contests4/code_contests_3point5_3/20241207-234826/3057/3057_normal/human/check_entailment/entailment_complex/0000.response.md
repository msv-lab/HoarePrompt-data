Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program reads two integers as input, `steps` and `index`, but it does not actually generate the sequence as described in the problem. Instead, it tries to calculate a specific value based on the input `index` and the number of `steps`, which is not the same as finding the value at the `k-th` position in the generated sequence.

The program logic is flawed and does not align with the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this task.
