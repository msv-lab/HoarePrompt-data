Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that if the index is odd, the code should print 1. However, the code does not handle this case at all. Instead, it enters a loop to adjust 'steps', 'left', and 'right' based on conditions until '(right + left) / 2' equals 'index', then prints the final value of 'steps'. This logic does not align with the problem description, as it does not correctly output 1 when the index is odd. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
