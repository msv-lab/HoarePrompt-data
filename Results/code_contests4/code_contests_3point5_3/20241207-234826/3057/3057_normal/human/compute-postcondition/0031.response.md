Output State: **After the loop has executed, `steps` is adjusted based on the conditions in the loop, `index` remains the same as the input even integer, `left` is 1, `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `steps` minus 1. The final values of `left` and `right` are dependent on the specific conditions met during the loop iterations.**
