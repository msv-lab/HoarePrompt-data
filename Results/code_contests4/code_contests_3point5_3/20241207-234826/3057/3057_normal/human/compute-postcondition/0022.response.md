Example Answer: 
`left` and `right` are assigned the value of `(right + left) / 2 + 1`, but the previous values of `left` and `right` are unknown. Since `steps` is decreased by 1, the calculation involves the decreased value of `steps`. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is decreased by 1, `left` and `right` are calculated based on previous unknown values.
Output State: **`steps` is decreased by 1, `left` and `right` are calculated based on previous unknown values**
