Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated to the result of the expression `(right + left) / 2 - 1`. The previous value of `right` is unknown, but `steps` is decreased by 1. Therefore, after execution, `right` is assigned a new value based on the calculation. 
Output State: **`steps` is decreased by 1, `right` is updated based on the calculation**
