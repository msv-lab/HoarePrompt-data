Example Answer:
`steps` is converted to an integer value using the `int()` function. The previous value of `steps` is the value returned by `raw_input().split()`, and `index` is also assigned this value. After the conversion, `steps` is an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is an integer, `index` is the value returned by `raw_input().split()`.
Output State: **`steps` is an integer, `index` is the value returned by `raw_input().split()`**
