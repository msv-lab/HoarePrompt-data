Example Answer: 
`index` is assigned the integer value of the variable `index` returned by `raw_input().split()`. The value of `index` is dependent on the input provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is an integer, `index` is an input integer.
Output State: **`steps` is an integer, `index` is an input integer**
