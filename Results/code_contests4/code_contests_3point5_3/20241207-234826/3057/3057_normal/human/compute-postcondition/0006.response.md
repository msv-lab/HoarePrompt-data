Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value of `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`, where `math.pow(2, steps)` calculates 2 raised to the power of `steps`. Since the initial value of `left` is 1, `steps` is an integer, and `index` is an input integer, the value of `right` is determined by the value of `steps`. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is an integer, `index` is an input integer, `left` is 1, `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `steps` minus 1.
Output State: **`steps` is an integer, `index` is an input integer, `left` is 1, `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `steps` minus 1**
