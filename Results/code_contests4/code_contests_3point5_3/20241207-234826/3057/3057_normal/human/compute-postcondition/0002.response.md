Example Answer:
`steps` and `index` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`. The values returned by `raw_input().split()` will depend on the input provided, so the specific values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` and `index` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`.
Output State: **`steps` and `index` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`**
