Example Answer:
`left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `(right + left) / 2 + 1`. The previous value of `steps` is not specified, so we cannot calculate the exact values of `left` and `right`. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is decreased by 1; `left` and `right` are both assigned the calculated value.
Output State: **`steps` is decreased by 1; `left` and `right` are both assigned the calculated value**
