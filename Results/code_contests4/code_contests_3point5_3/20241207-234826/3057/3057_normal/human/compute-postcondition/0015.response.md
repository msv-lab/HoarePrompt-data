Postcondition: ***`steps` is adjusted, `index` is an input even integer, `left` is 1, `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `steps` minus 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `(right + left) / 2` is not equal to `index`, `steps` is decreased by 1, and `index` is greater than `(right + left) / 2`. Moreover, `index` is greater than `(right + left) / 2`.***
