Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value of `(right + left) / 2 - 1`, where `right` is the previous value decreased by 1, and `left` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `right` depends on the original value of `right`. Since `left` is undefined, the output state will include the updated value of `right` only.
Output State: **`right` is updated based on the formula (right + left) / 2 - 1**
