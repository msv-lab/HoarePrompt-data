Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. It seems to be attempting to find the element at the k-th position in a different way which does not match the algorithm provided.

An example where the program does not work as expected is when n=3 and k=2. According to the algorithm, the obtained sequence should be [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]. The number on the second position should be 2. However, the program does not output the correct result for this case.
