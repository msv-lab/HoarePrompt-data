Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It takes the number of steps and the index as input, calculates the left and right boundaries based on the number of steps, and then iterates to find the value at the given index. The logic of updating the left and right boundaries in the while loop is correct and ensures that the correct value is printed at the end. The program handles all potential cases and produces the correct output for each one.
