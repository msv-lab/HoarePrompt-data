Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input values correctly and performs the necessary calculations to determine the minimum time required to read all the needed tracks.
- It iteratively refines a range of values until a specific condition is met, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code handles the movement of multiple heads independently and ensures that each track is read within the given constraints.
- The output provided by the program matches the expected output based on the problem description and examples given.
- There are no edge cases identified where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
