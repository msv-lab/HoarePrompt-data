Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, but it must be less than `len(p)` by at least 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is still less than `len(p)` by at least 1.
Output State: **`pidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is still less than `len(p)` by at least 1**
