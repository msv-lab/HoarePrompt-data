According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. 

Right before the loop:
- `alsotoright` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`
- `remtime` is calculated as described
- `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Make sure `pidx` is less than the length of `p`
- Check if the value at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`

State: **All variables remain the same except `alsotoright` which is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `remtime` is calculated as described, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime), for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to furthestright**
