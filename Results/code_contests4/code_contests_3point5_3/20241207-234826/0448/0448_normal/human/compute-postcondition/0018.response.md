Example Answer:
`leftime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. The variables `curpos` and `leftget` are defined in the initial state, so we can calculate the value of `leftime`. The value of `leftime` depends on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`, which are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `leftime`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg`, `getbacktime`, which are not defined, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg`, `getbacktime`, which are not defined, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`**
