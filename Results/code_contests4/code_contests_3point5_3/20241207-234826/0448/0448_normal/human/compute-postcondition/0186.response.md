According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be further increased by 1.
State: **All variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again**
