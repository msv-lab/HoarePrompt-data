Example Answer:
The variable `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`. The value of `avg` is unknown, but `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, `alsotoright` will be the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers, h is a non-empty list of integers, p is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, ll is updated to avg, hidx is 0, pidx is 0, works is False, leftget is the value at index 0 of list p, curpos is the value at index 0 of list h, getbacktime is a non-negative integer, alsotoright is the maximum of 0 and avg - getbacktime**
