Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is increased by 1, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg`, `getbacktime`, `remtime` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, the loop condition `hidx < len(h) and pidx < len(p)` is satisfied for the loop to execute again. If `curpos - leftget > avg`, `works` is False and `hidx` is increased by 1, `alsotoright` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the result of `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, and `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.**
