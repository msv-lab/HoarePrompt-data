Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `furthestright`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `p` remain unchanged; `pidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`furthestright`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `p` remain unchanged; `pidx` is incremented by 1**
