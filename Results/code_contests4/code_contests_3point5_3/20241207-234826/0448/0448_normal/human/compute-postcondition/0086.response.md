Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is False, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` or `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
