Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 2, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is now the value of `h[hidx]` for the next iteration, if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `remtime` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and half the difference between `avg` and `leftime`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`.**
