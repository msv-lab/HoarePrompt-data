Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The condition for the loop to execute again requires `pidx` to be less than `len(p)` by at least 1, and for `pidx` to be less than `len(p)` by at least 2 and `p[pidx]` to be less than or equal to `furthestright`, but the specific values of `pidx`, `len(p)`, and `furthestright` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`pidx` is incremented by 1**
