According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is increased by 2, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is now the value of `h[hidx]` for the next iteration, `furthestright` is recalculated based on the updated values, and `pidx` is increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `pidx` needs to be increased by 1
- `furthestright` needs to be recalculated based on the updated values
- Ensure that `pidx` is still less than the length of `p`
- Ensure that the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to the recalculated `furthestright`

State: **`hidx` is increased by 2, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is now the value of `h[hidx]` for the next iteration, `furthestright` is recalculated based on the updated values, `pidx` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= recalculated furthestright**
