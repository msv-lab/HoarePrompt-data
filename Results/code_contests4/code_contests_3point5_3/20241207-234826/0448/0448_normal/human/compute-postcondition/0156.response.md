Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers, h is a non-empty list of integers, p is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, ll is updated to avg, hidx is 0, pidx is 0, works is True, leftget is the value at index 0 of list p, curpos is the value at index 0 of list h. The difference between curpos and leftget is greater than avg***
