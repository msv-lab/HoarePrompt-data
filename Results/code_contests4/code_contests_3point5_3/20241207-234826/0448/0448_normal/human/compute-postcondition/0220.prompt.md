ou have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` had greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**
Your Task:

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000
Code of the loop:
```
while ss < ll:
    avg = (ss + ll) // 2
    works = True
    hidx = 0
    pidx = 0
    while hidx < len(h) and pidx < len(p):
        leftget = p[pidx]
        curpos = h[hidx]
        if curpos - leftget > avg:
            works = False
            break
        getbacktime = max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))
        alsotoright = max(0, avg - getbacktime)
        leftime = max(0, curpos - leftget)
        remtime = max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)
        furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
        while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
            pidx += 1
        hidx += 1
    if pidx != len(p):
        works = False
    if works:
        ll = avg
    else:
        ss = avg + 1

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is True if the condition is met, `hidx` is increased by the total number of elements in list `h`, `leftget` is the last value from list `p`, `curpos` is the last value from list `h`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are calculated based on the last values of `curpos` and `leftget`, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p`. If the condition `pidx` is not equal to the length of list `p`, then the program state remains the same. If the condition is not met, `ll` remains 21000000000, `works` is False, and the rest of the program variables retain their initial values.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is equal to the length of list `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p`, and `pidx` is not equal to the length of list `p`. If `works` is True, the program retains the initial state. If `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n`, `m` are positive integers, `h` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is the length of list `h`, `works` is True, `leftget` is the value at index 0 of list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is equal to len(p) or the index where the loop condition `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright` is no longer satisfied, `hidx` is the length of list `h`. After executing the if else block, the state of the program is determined by the satisfaction of the condition `pidx != len(p)` and `works` is True. All variables remain the same except `ss` which is assigned the value `avg + 1`.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state, after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
