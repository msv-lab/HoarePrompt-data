According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if both `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased to the value where the loop condition `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright` is no longer satisfied, and `hidx` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `hidx` needs to be increased by 1 and `pidx` needs to be adjusted to the index where either `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p` or `p[pidx] > furthestright`.
State: **All variables remain the same except `pidx` is adjusted as described and `hidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again**
