Example Answer:
The value of `pidx` is increased by 1. The initial state mentions that `pidx` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again, so after this code snippet executes, `pidx` will be increased by a total of 3. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased by 3.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased by 3**
