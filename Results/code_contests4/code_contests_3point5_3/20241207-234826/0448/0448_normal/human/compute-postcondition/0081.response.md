According to the code, the loop can execute if both `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`. Right before the loop, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, either `hidx` needs to be less than the length of list `h` or `pidx` needs to be less than the length of list `p`.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is True, for the loop to execute the first time either `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` or `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`**
