Example Answer:
`leftime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`. The values of `curpos` and `leftget` are unknown in the initial state, so the exact value of `leftime` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `alsotoright` which is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `alsotoright` which is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`**
