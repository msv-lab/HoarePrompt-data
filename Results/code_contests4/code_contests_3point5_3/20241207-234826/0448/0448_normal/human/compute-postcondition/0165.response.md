According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. 

Right before the loop, `pidx` is 0, `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, and `furthestright` is calculated based on the values of `curpos`, `leftget`, `avg`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `p` should have at least one element (non-empty list).
2. `pidx` should be less than the length of list `p`.
3. The value at index `pidx` of list `p` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `leftget` is the value at index 0 of list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time `p` should have at least one element, `pidx` should be less than the length of list `p`, and the value at index `pidx` of list `p` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
