According to the loop condition, the loop will execute if both `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright` are true. Right before the loop, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is increased by 1, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg`, `getbacktime`, `remtime` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `furthestright` needs to be recalculated based on the updated values of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.
2. `pidx` needs to be increased by 1.
3. The condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` needs to be satisfied again for the loop to execute.

State: **For the loop to execute the first time, adjust `furthestright` based on updated `alsotoright` and `remtime`, increment `pidx` by 1, make sure `p[pidx] <= furthestright` is true**.
