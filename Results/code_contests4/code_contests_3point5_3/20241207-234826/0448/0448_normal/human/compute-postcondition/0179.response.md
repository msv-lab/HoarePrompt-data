Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is 2, `works` is False, `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 2 of list `h`, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, the loop has executed until `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p` or the value at index `pidx` of list `p` is greater than `furthestright`, `pidx` is an integer, `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p` and `getbacktime` is updated to max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))**
