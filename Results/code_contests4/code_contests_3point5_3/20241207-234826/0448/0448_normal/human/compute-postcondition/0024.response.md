Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is 0, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg`, `getbacktime`, `remtime` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than 0, `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `pidx` should be less than `len(p)`, `pidx` is incremented by 1**
