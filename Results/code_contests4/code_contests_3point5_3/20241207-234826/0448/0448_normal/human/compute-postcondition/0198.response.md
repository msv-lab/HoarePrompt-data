Example Answer: 
`getbacktime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. The value of `curpos` is updated based on the increased `hidx`, and if the condition `curpos - leftget > avg` is met, `works` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `pidx` is adjusted as described, `hidx` is increased by 1, `curpos` is assigned a new value based on the updated `hidx`, and `works` may be set to False if the condition is met.**
