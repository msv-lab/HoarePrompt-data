Example Answer:
`getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. The values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False. Otherwise, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of list `p` in order for the loop to execute again, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False. Otherwise, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of list `p` in order for the loop to execute again, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.**
