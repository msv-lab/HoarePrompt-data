Example Answer:
`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, where `hidx` has been increased by 2 for the loop to execute again. The value of `h` at index `hidx` is now stored in `curpos`, and `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `hidx` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is now the value of `h[hidx]`.
Output State: **variable `hidx` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is now the value of `h[hidx]**.
