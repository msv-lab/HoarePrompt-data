Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`. If the value at index 0 of list `h` minus `leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is False. Otherwise, the program retains its initial state.***
