Example Answer:
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The value of `pidx` is adjusted as described, and `hidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `pidx` is adjusted as described, `hidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `pidx` is adjusted as described, `hidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again**
