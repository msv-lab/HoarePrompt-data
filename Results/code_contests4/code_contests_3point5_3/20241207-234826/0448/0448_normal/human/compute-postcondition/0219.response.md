Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers, `h` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is the length of list `h`, `works` is True, `leftget` is the value at index 0 of list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is equal to len(p) or the index where the loop condition `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright` is no longer satisfied, `hidx` is the length of list `h`. After executing the if else block, the state of the program is determined by the satisfaction of the condition `pidx != len(p)` and `works` is True. All variables remain the same except `ss` which is assigned the value `avg + 1`.***
