According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, the values of `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` are calculated based on certain conditions. To ensure the loop executes one more time:
1. `alsotoright` should be calculated with a different condition to ensure it is greater than 0.
2. `leftime` should be calculated with a different condition to ensure it is greater than 0.
3. `remtime` should be calculated with a different condition to ensure it is greater than 0.
4. `furthestright` should be recalculated based on the adjusted values of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.
No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time the adjusted values of `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` are needed**
