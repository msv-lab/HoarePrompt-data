The variables are updated based on the calculations mentioned in the code snippet.

`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`.
`leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`.
`remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`.

Then, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
