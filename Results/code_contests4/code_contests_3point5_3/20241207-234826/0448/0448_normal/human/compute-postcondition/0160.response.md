Example Answer:
The value of `getbacktime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. The previous values of `curpos` and `leftget` are known from the initial state. If the difference is positive, `getbacktime` will be equal to 2 times the difference, otherwise, it will be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers, h is a non-empty list of integers, p is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, ll is updated to avg, hidx is 0, pidx is 0, works is False, leftget is the value at index 0 of list p, curpos is the value at index 0 of list h. If the difference between curpos and leftget is greater than avg, works is set to False, getbacktime is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers, h is a non-empty list of integers, p is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, ll is updated to avg, hidx is 0, pidx is 0, works is False, leftget is the value at index 0 of list p, curpos is the value at index 0 of list h. If the difference between curpos and leftget is greater than avg, works is set to False, getbacktime is a non-negative integer**
