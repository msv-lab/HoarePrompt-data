According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `furthestright` needs to be updated to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime) + 1`
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `pidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is increased by 1, `curpos` is assigned a new value based on the updated `hidx`, `works` may be set to False if the condition is met, `leftime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime) + 1` for the loop to execute one more time**
