Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input values and performs a complex calculation involving multiple conditions and loops to determine a specific value. It iteratively refines a range of values until a specific condition is met. However, the exact purpose or outcome of this calculation is not explicitly stated in the code or annotations. The function does not accept any parameters, and it prints a final value after the calculations.**
