Example Answer:
The value of `pidx` is increased by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, so the output state is: `alsotoright` is adjusted, `pidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is increased, `curpos` is updated, `works` may be set to False, `leftime` is adjusted, `remtime` is adjusted, `furthestright` is adjusted for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is adjusted, `pidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is increased, `curpos` is updated, `works` may be set to False, `leftime` is adjusted, `remtime` is adjusted, `furthestright` is adjusted for the loop to execute again**
