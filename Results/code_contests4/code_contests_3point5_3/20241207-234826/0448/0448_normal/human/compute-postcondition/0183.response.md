Example Answer:
`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. The value of `alsotoright` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`. `remtime` is calculated based on the description provided. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `alsotoright` which is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, and `remtime` is calculated as described. `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `alsotoright` which is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, and `remtime` is calculated as described. `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**.
