Example Answer:
`leftime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`. The value of `curpos` and `leftget` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `leftime`. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`**
