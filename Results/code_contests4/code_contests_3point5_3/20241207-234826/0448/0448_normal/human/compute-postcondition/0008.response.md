Example Answer:
`pidx` is assigned the value of 0. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0**
