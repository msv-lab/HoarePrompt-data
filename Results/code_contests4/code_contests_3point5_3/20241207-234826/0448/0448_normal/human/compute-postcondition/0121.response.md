Output State: **`pidx` is incremented by the total number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p` or greater, `hidx` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` needs to be less than len(h) and `pidx` needs to be less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`**
