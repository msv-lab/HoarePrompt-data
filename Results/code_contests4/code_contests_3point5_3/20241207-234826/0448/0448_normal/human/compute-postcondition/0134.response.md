Example Answer: 
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, so after execution, `pidx` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` based on current conditions, and `pidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` based on current conditions, and `pidx` is incremented by 1**
