According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx`, `h`, `pidx`, and `p`. If `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `hidx` needs to be increased by 1 again, and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **variable `hidx` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again**
