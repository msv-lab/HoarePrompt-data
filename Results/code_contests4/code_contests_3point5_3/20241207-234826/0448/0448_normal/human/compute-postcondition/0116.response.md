According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented by 1 and still less than `len(p)` by at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be less than `len(p)` by at least 2 and `p[pidx]` must still be less than or equal to `furthestright`.
State: **`pidx` is incremented by 1 and still less than `len(p)` by at least 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than `len(p)` by at least 2 and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
