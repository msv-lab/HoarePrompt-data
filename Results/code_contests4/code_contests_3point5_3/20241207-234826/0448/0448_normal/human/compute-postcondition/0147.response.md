Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is equal to the length of list `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p`, and `pidx` is not equal to the length of list `p`. If `works` is True, the program retains the initial state. If `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`.***
