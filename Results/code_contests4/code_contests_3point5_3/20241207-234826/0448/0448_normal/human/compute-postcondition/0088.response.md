Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is True, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` or `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.**
