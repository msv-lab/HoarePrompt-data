Example Answer:
`hidx` is increased by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so after execution, `hidx` will be one value higher than before. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is adjusted, `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx` is increased by 1, `curpos` is updated, `works` may be set to False, `leftime` is adjusted, `remtime` is adjusted, `furthestright` is updated, the loop has finished execution.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is adjusted, `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx` is increased by 1, `curpos` is updated, `works` may be set to False, `leftime` is adjusted, `remtime` is adjusted, `furthestright` is updated, the loop has finished execution.**
