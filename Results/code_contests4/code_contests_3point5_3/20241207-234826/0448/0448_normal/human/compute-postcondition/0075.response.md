Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is True if the condition is met, `hidx` is increased by the total number of elements in list `h`, `leftget` is the last value from list `p`, `curpos` is the last value from list `h`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are calculated based on the last values of `curpos` and `leftget`, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p`. If the condition `pidx` is not equal to the length of list `p`, then the program state remains the same. If the condition is not met, `ll` remains 21000000000, `works` is False, and the rest of the program variables retain their initial values.***
