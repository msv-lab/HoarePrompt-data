According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers
- `h` is a non-empty list of integers
- `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input
- `ll` is updated to `avg`
- `hidx` is 0
- `works` is False
- `leftget` is the value at index 0 of list `p`
- `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`
- `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer
- `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`
- `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`
- `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)
- `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`
- `pidx` is an integer

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `pidx` should be incremented by 1
- The value at index `pidx` of list `p` should still be less than or equal to `furthestright`

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `leftget` is the value at index 0 of list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute one more time `pidx` should be incremented and the value at index `pidx` of list `p` should still be less than or equal to `furthestright**`
