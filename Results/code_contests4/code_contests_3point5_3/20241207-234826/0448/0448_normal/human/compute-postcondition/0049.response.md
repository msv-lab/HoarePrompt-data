Example Answer:
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The value of `pidx` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `leftget`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `hidx` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
Output State: **variable `hidx` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`**
