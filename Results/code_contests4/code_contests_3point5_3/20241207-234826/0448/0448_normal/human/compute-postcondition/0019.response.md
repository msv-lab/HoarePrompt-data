Example Answer:
The value of `leftime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. Then, `remtime` is computed as the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - leftime` divided by 2. However, the initial values of `avg`, `leftget`, `curpos` are not provided, so the output state includes the calculated values based on the initial state variables. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg`, `getbacktime`, `remtime` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`.**
