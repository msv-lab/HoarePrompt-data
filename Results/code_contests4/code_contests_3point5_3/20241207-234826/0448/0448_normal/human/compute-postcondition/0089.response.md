Example Answer:
`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`. The values of `avg`, `getbacktime`, and `works` are affected by the calculations, but the values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is True, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` or `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is True, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` or `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`**
