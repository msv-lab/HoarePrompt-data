According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `hidx`, `pidx`, `h`, and `p`. If `hidx` is less than the length of list `h`, and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented by the total number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p` or greater, and `hidx` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `hidx` needs to be less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` needs to be less than the length of list `p`.
State: **`pidx` is incremented by the total number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p` or greater, `hidx` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` needs to be less than len(h) and `pidx` needs to be less than len(p)**
