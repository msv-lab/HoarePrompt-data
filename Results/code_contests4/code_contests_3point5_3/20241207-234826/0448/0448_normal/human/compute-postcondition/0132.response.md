Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time the adjusted values of `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` are needed, and `pidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time the adjusted values of `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` are needed, `pidx` is incremented by 1**
