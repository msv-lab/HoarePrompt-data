According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `furthestright`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `p` remain unchanged, and `pidx` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute again, `pidx` needs to be less than the updated length of `p` and the value at the updated index `pidx` in `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`.
State: **`furthestright`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `p` remain unchanged; `pidx` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `pidx` needs to be less than the updated length of `p` and the value at the updated index `pidx` in `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
