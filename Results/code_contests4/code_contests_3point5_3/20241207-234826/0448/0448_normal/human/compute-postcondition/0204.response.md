Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `pidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is increased by 1, `curpos` is assigned a new value based on the updated `hidx`, `works` may be set to False if the condition is met, `leftime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` for the loop to execute the first time**
