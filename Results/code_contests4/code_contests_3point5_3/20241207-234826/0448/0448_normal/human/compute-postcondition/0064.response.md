Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 2, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is now the value of `h[hidx]` for the next iteration, `furthestright` is recalculated based on the updated values, `pidx` is increased by 3, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) after being increased by 3 and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
