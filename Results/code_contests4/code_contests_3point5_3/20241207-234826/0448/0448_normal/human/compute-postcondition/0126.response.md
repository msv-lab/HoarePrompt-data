Example Answer:
The value of `getbacktime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. If `curpos - leftget` is positive, `getbacktime` will be `2 * (curpos - leftget)`. If `curpos - leftget` is negative, `getbacktime` will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx`, `hidx` are integers, `curpos - leftget > avg`, `pidx` is incremented by the total number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p` or greater, `hidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again, `hidx` needs to be less than len(h) and `pidx` needs to be less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `works` is False, and `getbacktime` is calculated as described.
