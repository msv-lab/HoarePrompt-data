Example Answer:
The variable `avg` is assigned the value of `(ss + ll) // 2`, but the variable `ss` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000**
