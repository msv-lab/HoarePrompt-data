Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `leftget` is the value at index 0 of list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. The loop will execute one more time if the value at index `pidx` of list `p` is still less than or equal to `furthestright`.
