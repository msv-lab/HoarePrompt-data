Output State: **n and m are positive integers, h is a non-empty list of integers, p is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, ll is updated to avg, hidx is 0, pidx is 0, works is False, leftget is the value at index 0 of list p, curpos is the value at index 0 of list h, getbacktime is a non-negative integer, alsotoright is the maximum of 0 and avg - getbacktime, leftime is the maximum of 0 and curpos - leftget, remtime is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), furthestright is calculated as curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**
