According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` have been calculated based on certain conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, these values need to be adjusted to their new values based on the current state. Additionally, `pidx` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **Adjust `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` based on current conditions, and increment `pidx` by 1 for the loop to execute again**
