Example Answer:
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, where `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, and `pidx` is 0. Therefore, `leftget` takes the value of the element at index 0 of list `p`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is True, `leftget` is the value at index 0 of list `p`**
