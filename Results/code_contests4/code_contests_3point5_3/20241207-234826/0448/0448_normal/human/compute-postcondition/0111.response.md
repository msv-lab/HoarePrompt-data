Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `works` is False if `curpos - leftget > avg`, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is adjusted to be less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.**
