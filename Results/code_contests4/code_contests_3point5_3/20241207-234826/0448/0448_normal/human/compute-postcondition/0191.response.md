Example Answer:
`hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, but after the increment, `hidx` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased to the value where the loop condition `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright` is no longer satisfied, and `hidx` is increased by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased to the value where the loop condition `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright` is no longer satisfied, and `hidx` is increased by 1**
