According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` after incrementing by 1. Additionally, the value at index `pidx` in `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright` for the loop to continue.

State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`, `pidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
