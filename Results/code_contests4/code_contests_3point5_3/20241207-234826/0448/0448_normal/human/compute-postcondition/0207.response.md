According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and if the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `alsotoright` needs to be adjusted to the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`.
2. `pidx` needs to be increased by 2.
3. `hidx` needs to be increased by 1.
4. `curpos` needs to be assigned a new value based on the updated `hidx`.
5. `works` may need to be set to False if the condition is met.
6. `leftime` needs to be adjusted to the maximum value between 0 and the result of `curpos - leftget`.
7. `remtime` needs to be adjusted to the maximum value between 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`.
8. `furthestright` needs to be adjusted to the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime) + 1`.

State: **`alsotoright` is adjusted, `pidx` is increased, `hidx` is increased, `curpos` is updated, `works` may be set to False, `leftime` is adjusted, `remtime` is adjusted, `furthestright` is adjusted for the loop to execute again**.
