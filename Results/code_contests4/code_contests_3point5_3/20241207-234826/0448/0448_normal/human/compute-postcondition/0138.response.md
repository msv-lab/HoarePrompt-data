Example Answer: 
`hidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `hidx` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` remain the same as the initial values, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `hidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` remain the same as the initial values, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `hidx` is incremented by 1**
