According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `ss` is less than `ll`. Right before the loop, `ss` is 0 and `ll` is 21000000000. In order for the loop to execute the first time, `ss` needs to be less than `ll`, so no adjustments are needed for `ss`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000**
