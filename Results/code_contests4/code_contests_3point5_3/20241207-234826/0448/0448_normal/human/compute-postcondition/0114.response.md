According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `pidx` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `p` by at least 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`pidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) by at least 1**
