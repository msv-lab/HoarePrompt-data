Example Answer: 
`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, where `hidx` is increased by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so the value of `curpos` depends on the value of `h` at the new index `hidx`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `pidx` is adjusted as described, `hidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again, and `curpos` is assigned a new value based on the updated `hidx`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `pidx` is adjusted as described, `hidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again, and `curpos` is assigned a new value based on the updated `hidx`**
