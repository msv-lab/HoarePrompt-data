Postcondition: ***All variables remain the same except `pidx` is adjusted as described, `hidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again, and `curpos` is assigned a new value based on the updated `hidx`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
