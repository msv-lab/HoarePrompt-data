Example Answer:
The variable `getbacktime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. Then, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`. The values of `avg`, `curpos`, `leftget` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg`, `getbacktime`, which are not defined.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is either True or False, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is a value from list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg`, `getbacktime`, which are not defined.**
