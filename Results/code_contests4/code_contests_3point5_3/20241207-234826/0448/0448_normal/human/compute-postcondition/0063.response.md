According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is increased by 2, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is now the value of `h[hidx]` for the next iteration, `furthestright` is recalculated based on the updated values, `pidx` is increased by 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` after being increased by 2 and the value at index `pidx` in `p` must be less than or equal to the recalculated `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is increased by 2, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is now the value of `h[hidx]` for the next iteration, `furthestright` is recalculated based on the updated values, `pidx` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) after being increased by 2 and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
