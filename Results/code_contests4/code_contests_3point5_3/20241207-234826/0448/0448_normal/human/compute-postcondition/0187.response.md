Example Answer: 
`pidx` is increased by 1, so after execution, the new value of `pidx` is the previous value of `pidx` + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `pidx` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again**
