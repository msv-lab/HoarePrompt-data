According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `hidx`, `pidx`, `h`, and `p`. If `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `hidx` needs to be less than the length of list `h`.
2. `pidx` needs to be less than the length of list `p`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is 21000000000, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`**
