Example Answer:
`remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`. The value of `leftime` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`, and `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`**
