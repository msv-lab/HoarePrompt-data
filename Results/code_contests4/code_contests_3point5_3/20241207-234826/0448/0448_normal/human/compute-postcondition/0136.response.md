Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`, `pidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`, `pidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
