According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `furthestright`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, and `p` remain unchanged; only `pidx` is incremented by 1. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`furthestright`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `p` remain unchanged; `pidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` should still be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
