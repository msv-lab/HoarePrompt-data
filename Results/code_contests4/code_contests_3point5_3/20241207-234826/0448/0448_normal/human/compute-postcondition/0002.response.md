Example Answer:
The input is taken as a space-separated string of integers and converted into a list of integers using the map and int functions. The resulting list is assigned to variable `p`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `h` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
