Example Answer:
`remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `(avg - leftime) // 2`. The value of `avg` and `leftime` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `remtime`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `alsotoright` which is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `remtime` is calculated as described.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `alsotoright` which is updated to the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `remtime` is calculated as described.**
