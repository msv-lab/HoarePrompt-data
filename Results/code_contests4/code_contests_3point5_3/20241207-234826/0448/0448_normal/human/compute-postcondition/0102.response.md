Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ll` is updated to `avg`, `works` is True, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `curpos - leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of list `p` in order for the loop to execute again, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`**
