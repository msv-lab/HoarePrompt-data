#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9]**
def func():
    print(5)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters but relies on global variables n, k, and a. These variables are expected to be integers satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, and a is a list of n integers in the range [1, 10^9]. The function prints the number 5. The actual operations on the list a based on n and k mentioned in the annotations are missing in the code. Therefore, the functionality related to these operations and the result based on them is not implemented in the provided code.
