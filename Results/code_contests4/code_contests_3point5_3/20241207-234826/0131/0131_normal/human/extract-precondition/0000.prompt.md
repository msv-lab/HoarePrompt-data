You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given the array a consisting of n elements and the integer k ≤ n.

You want to obtain at least k equal elements in the array a. In one move, you can make one of the following two operations:

  * Take one of the minimum elements of the array and increase its value by one (more formally, if the minimum value of a is mn then you choose such index i that a_i = mn and set a_i := a_i + 1); 
  * take one of the maximum elements of the array and decrease its value by one (more formally, if the maximum value of a is mx then you choose such index i that a_i = mx and set a_i := a_i - 1). 



Your task is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of elements in a and the required number of equal elements.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the i-th element of a.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array.
