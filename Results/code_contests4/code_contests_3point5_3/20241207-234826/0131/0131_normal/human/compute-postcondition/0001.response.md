The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the global variables n, k, and a. n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element is in the range [1, 10^9]. 
The function performs some operations on the list a based on the values of n and k, and then returns a result based on these operations. The specific details of the operations and the resulting output are not provided in the given information.
