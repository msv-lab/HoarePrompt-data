Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array, but it simply prints the number 5 without performing any operations on the input array 'a'. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
