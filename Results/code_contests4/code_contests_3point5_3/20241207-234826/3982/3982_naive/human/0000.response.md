Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. It calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration for the robbers based on the positions of the robbers and searchlights. The program uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum number of moves required. The logic for updating the positions of the robbers by moving them to the right or up is correctly implemented. The program also handles edge cases such as when the coordinates are at the upper limit (10^6) for both robbers and searchlights. Overall, the program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output.
