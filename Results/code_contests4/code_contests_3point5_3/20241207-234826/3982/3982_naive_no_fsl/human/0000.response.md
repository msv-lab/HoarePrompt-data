Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of robbers and searchlights along with their coordinates. It then calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration where no searchlight can see a robber. The logic implemented in the program seems to correctly follow the problem description by iterating through all possible combinations of robbers and searchlights, calculating the relative positions, and then determining the minimum number of moves required.

The program also handles the input and output format as described in the problem statement. Overall, based on the provided code and the problem description, it seems that the program is correct and should work for all potential cases.
