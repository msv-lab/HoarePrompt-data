Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, but the initial state of `rel_lights_x` and `i` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as before with no changes to the variables.
Output State: **`psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans` remain the same as before, `avail[i]` is 0 for all values of `i` up to `ans`, `i` is 0, `avail[ans + 1]` is 0 for the loop to execute**
