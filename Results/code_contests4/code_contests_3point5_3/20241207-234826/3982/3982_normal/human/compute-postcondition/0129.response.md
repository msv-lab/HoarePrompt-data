Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. The value of `rel_lights_x` at index `i` is assigned to `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `avail` list are 0, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is updated, `ax` is updated, `l` is updated, `r` is updated, `ans` remains negative, `n` is greater than 0, and `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`.
Output State: **All elements in the `avail` list are 0, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is updated, `ax` is updated, `l` is updated, `r` is updated, `ans` remains negative, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]**.
