Example Answer:
`sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `x` and the sum of `x`, `y`, and `ans`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` are known from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans`, `avail[i]` remain the same. All values of `avail[i]` up to `ans` are 0. `avail[ans + 1]` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1. `x` is now assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i] and sp is calculated based on the formula sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans)).
