According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `robbers` list. If there are still elements in the `robbers` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements in the `robbers` list.
State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, the `robbers` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time.**
