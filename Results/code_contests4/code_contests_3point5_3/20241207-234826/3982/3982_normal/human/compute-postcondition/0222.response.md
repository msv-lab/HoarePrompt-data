According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in the `avail` list. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum value between the previous `psum_min` and the previous `psum`, `psum` is updated to be the sum of the previous `psum` and the next element in `avail`, `avail` still has elements left for the loop to execute, and `ax` is the next element in `avail`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least one more element left in `avail`.
State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between the previous `psum_min` and the previous `psum`, `psum` is the sum of the previous `psum` and the next element in `avail`, `avail` still has at least one more element left for the loop to execute, `ax` is the next element in `avail`**
