Example Answer:
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. The value of `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except `ep` which is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`; `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `ep` which is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`; `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1**
