Example Answer:
`sp` is the index used to access `avail` array, so `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, with the specified changes to `sp` and `avail` array, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, with the specified changes to `sp` and `avail` array, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1**
