According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is 10. No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.
State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `robbers` list has been fully iterated through, `lights` list has been fully iterated through, all possible non-negative differences between the coordinates have been appended to `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the last element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the last element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10, and a list `avail` is created with zeros of length 10**.
