Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. The previous values of `x`, `rel_lights_x[i]`, and other variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans`, `avail[i]` remain the same. All values of `avail[i]` up to `ans` are 0. `avail[ans + 1]` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1. `x` is now assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`.
