Postcondition: ***`psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans`, `avail[i]`, `i` remain the same. All values of `avail[i]` up to `ans` are 0. `avail[ans + 1]` is 0. `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`. `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression x - (x + y - ans). `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. `avail[sp]` is increased by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, the value of `avail[ep+1]` is decreased by 1.***
