Example Answer:
The values of x and y are calculated based on the differences between lx and rx, ly and ry respectively. The values of lx, rx, ly, ry are not provided, so the exact values of x and y cannot be determined. However, x and y are calculated based on these differences. Therefore, the Output State is: Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty. x and y are both greater than or equal to 0. rel_lights_x contains x as one of its elements and rel_lights_y contains y as one of its elements.
Output State: **Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty. x and y are both greater than or equal to 0. rel_lights_x contains x as one of its elements and rel_lights_y contains y as one of its elements.**
