Example Answer:
A list `avail` is created with a length of `10 ** 6 + 1 + 1`, filled with zeros. The previous values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `robbers` list has been fully iterated through, `lights` list has been fully iterated through, all possible non-negative differences between the coordinates have been appended to `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the last element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the last element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10, and a list `avail` is created with zeros of length `10 ** 6 + 1 + 1`.
