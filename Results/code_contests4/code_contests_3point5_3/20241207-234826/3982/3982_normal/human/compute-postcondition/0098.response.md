Example Answer: 
The value of `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. The previous values of the variables are as follows: all elements in `avail` are set to 0, `i` is 2, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`, `sp` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, the new output state is: all elements in `avail` are set to 0, `i` is 2, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`, `sp` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, and `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **all elements in `avail` are set to 0, `i` is 2, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`, `sp` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, and `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1**
