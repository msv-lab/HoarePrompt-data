Example Answer:
The value of `ax` is added to `psum`. As `ax` is the first element in `avail`, it is added to `psum`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is INF, `psum` is the value of `ax`, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` is not empty, `ax` is the first element in `avail`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is INF, `psum` is the value of `ax`, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` is not empty, `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
