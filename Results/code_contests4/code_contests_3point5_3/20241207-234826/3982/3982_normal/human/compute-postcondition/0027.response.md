Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the `rel_lights_x` list. The previous values of `rel_lights_x` are unknown, so after execution, `rel_lights_x` will contain `x` as one of its elements. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element and for the loop to execute lights list is not empty. In addition, x and y are both greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` contains `x` as one of its elements.
Output State: **Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element and for the loop to execute lights list is not empty. In addition, x and y are both greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` contains `x` as one of its elements.**
