Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `rel_lights_y[0]` is accessed. The value at index 0 of `rel_lights_y` is retrieved and assigned to `y`. The value of `y` depends on the actual content of `rel_lights_y` at index 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 0, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`.
Output State: **All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 0, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]**.
