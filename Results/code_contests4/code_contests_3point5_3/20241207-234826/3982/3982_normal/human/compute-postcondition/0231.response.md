Output State: **After the loop executes, `psum_min` is the minimum value among all the partial sums in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `avail` list has all its elements processed, `ax` is the last element in the `avail` list. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, `l` is set to `ans + 1`. Additionally, `l` is no longer less than `r` as the loop condition is false.**
