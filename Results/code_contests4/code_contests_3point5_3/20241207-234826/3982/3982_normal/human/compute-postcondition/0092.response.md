According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were set:
* Output State: All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 1, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is updated based on the new value of `x`, the element at the new index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1, and if the new `ep` is less than `ans`, the element at the new index `ep + 1` in the `avail` list is decremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
* `i` needs to be incremented by 1
* Recalculate `sp` based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`
* Update `ep` based on the new value of `x`
* Increment the element at the new index `sp` in the `avail` list by 1
* If the new `ep` is less than `ans`, decrement the element at the new index `ep + 1` in the `avail` list by 1
* Assign `sp` the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`
* Assign `ep` the minimum value between `ans` and `x`

State: **Output State: All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 2, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is updated based on the new value of `x`, the element at the new index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1, and if the new `ep` is less than `ans`, the element at the new index `ep + 1` in the `avail` list is decremented by 1. `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.**
