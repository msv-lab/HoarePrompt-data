According to the code, the loop can execute if the lights list is not empty. Before the loop starts, the lights list is not empty, so it is already in a state to execute the loop. However, since the next element to be processed in the robbers list is not specified, we need to adjust the state to specify that the next element to be processed in the robbers list is the first element.
State: **Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty**
