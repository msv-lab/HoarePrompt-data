Example Answer: 
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and the value of `avail[sp]` is increased by 1. After that, the value of `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1**
