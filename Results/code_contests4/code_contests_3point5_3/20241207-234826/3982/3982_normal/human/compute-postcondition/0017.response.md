According to the code, the loop will execute for each tuple `(lx, ly)` in the `lights` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `robbers`, `lights`, `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, `x`, `y` have their respective assigned values. `robbers` and `lights` are not empty lists. `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `rel_lights_x` has an additional value appended to it, and `rel_lights_y` now has the appended value of `y`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the `lights` list must be selected. Therefore, the next values of `lx` and `ly` need to be considered. 

The next `lx` value can be obtained by selecting the next element in the `lights` list after the current index. Similarly, the next `ly` value can be obtained in the same manner.

State: **`n`, `m`, `robbers`, `lights`, `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, `x`, `y` have their respective assigned values. `robbers` and `lights` are not empty lists. `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0. `rel_lights_x` has an additional value appended to it. `rel_lights_y` now has the appended value of `y`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the `lights` list must be selected.**
