According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute: `psum_min` should be updated to the minimum value among all the partial sums in `avail`, `psum` should be updated to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `ax` should be updated to the last element in the `avail` list, `l` should be updated to `ans + 2`, `r` should be updated to either `ans + 1` or `ans + 2`, and `ans` should remain negative.
State: **All elements in the `avail` list will be set to 0, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is updated, `ax` is updated, `l` is updated, `r` is updated, `ans` remains negative, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
