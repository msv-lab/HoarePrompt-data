Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the differences `lx - rx` and `ly - ry` respectively. The values of `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, `ry` are not provided, so the exact values of `x` and `y` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `robbers` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` list has at least 1 element, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first element in the lights list.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `robbers` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` list has at least 1 element, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first element in the lights list**
