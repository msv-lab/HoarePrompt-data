Example Answer:
`y` is appended to the `rel_lights_y` list. The previous values of `y` and `rel_lights_y` are not known, so after execution, `rel_lights_y` will contain `y` as one of its elements. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty, x and y are both greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` contains `x` as one of its elements, `rel_lights_y` contains `y` as one of its elements.
Output State: **Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty, x and y are both greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` contains `x` as one of its elements, `rel_lights_y` contains `y` as one of its elements**
