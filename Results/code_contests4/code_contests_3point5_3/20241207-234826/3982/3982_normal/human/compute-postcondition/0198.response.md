Output State: `psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans`, `avail[i]` remain the same. All values of `avail[i]` up to `ans` are 0. `avail[ans + 1]` is 0. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and (x - (x + y - ans)). The value of `avail[sp]` is increased by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep+1]` is decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, with the specified changes to `sp` and `avail` array**.
