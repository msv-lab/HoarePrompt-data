According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `avail`. If `avail` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `psum_min` is INF and `psum` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `avail` is not empty and `ax` is the first element in `avail`.
State: **`psum_min` is INF, `psum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` is not empty, `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
