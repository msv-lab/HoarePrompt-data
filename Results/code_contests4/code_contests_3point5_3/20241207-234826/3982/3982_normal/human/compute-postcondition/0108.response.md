Example Answer:
`psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`, where `ax` is the second element in the `avail` list. Since `psum` is the value of the second element in the `avail` list, after execution, `psum` will be updated based on the addition. `psum_min` is the minimum value between `INF` and the updated `psum`. The loop can still execute, and the `avail` list still has at least 2 elements.
Output State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between `INF` and the updated `psum`, `psum` is the updated value after adding `ax`, `avail` list has at least 2 elements, `ax` is the second element in the `avail` list**
