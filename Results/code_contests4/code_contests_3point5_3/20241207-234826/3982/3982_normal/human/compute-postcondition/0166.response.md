According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `avail`. If there are still elements left in the `avail` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between the current `psum_min` and `psum`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `avail` list must still have elements remaining.
State: **`psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between the current `psum_min` and `psum`, for the loop to execute one more time there are still elements in the `avail` list**
