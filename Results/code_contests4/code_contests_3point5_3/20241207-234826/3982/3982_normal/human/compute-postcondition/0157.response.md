Output State: **All elements in the `avail` list are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `psum_min` is the minimum value among all updated partial sums in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `ax` is the last element in the updated `avail` list, `l` is `ans + 1`, `r` is either `ans` or `ans + 1`, `ans` remains negative, `n` is the number of iterations in the loop, `x` and `y` are assigned values from `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` arrays respectively, `sp` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is the minimum of `ans` and `x`, and `ep` is decremented if necessary.**
