Postcondition: ***`psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep` are all variables with specific values and relationships. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then the program updates the values of the variables accordingly. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, the program updates the values of the variables differently. In both cases, the program maintains the initial conditions of the variables as described in the precondition.***
