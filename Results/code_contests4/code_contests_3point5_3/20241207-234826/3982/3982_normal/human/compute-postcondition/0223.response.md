Example Answer:
`psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`. The previous values of `psum` and `ax` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `psum` after execution. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is the minimum value between the previous `psum_min` and the previous `psum`, `psum` is the sum of the previous `psum` and the next element in `avail`, `avail` still has at least one more element left for the loop to execute, `ax` is the next element in `avail`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between the previous `psum_min` and the previous `psum`, `psum` is the sum of the previous `psum` and the next element in `avail`, `avail` still has at least one more element left for the loop to execute, `ax` is the next element in `avail`**
