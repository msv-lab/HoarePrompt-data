According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is the minimum value between `INF` and `psum`, `psum` is the value of the first element in the `avail` list, `avail` list has at least 1 element, `ax` is the first element in the `avail` list. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `avail` list must have at least 2 elements, and the next element after `ax` will be the new `ax`.
State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between `INF` and `psum`, `psum` is the value of the second element in the `avail` list, the loop can execute, `avail` list has at least 2 elements, `ax` is the second element in the `avail` list**
