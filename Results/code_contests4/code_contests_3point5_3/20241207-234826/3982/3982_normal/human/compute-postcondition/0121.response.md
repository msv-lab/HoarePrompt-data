According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. If `ans` is negative, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `psum_min` is equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `ans` is negative. Additionally, `l` is set to `ans + 1`, so `l` should be equal to `ans + 1` before the loop starts. The value of `r` is assigned based on `psum_min`, either equal to `ans` or `ans + 1`. 
State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value among all the partial sums in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `avail` list has all its elements processed, `ax` is the last element in the `avail` list, `psum_min` is not equal to 0, `l` is `ans + 1`, `r` is either `ans` or `ans + 1`, `ans` is negative, for the loop to execute `ans` is negative**
