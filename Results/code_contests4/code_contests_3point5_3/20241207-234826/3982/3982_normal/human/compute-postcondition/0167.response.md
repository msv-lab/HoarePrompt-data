Example Answer:
`psum` is updated to `psum + ax`. The value of `psum_min` remains unchanged as it is only updated to the minimum value between the current `psum_min` and `psum`. The loop will execute one more time if there are still elements in the `avail` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between the current `psum_min` and `psum`, the loop will execute one more time if there are still elements in the `avail` list.
Output State: **`psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between the current `psum_min` and `psum`, the loop will execute one more time if there are still elements in the `avail` list**.
