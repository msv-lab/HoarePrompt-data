According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `avail` list. Before the loop starts, all elements in the `avail` list are updated, so the loop can execute. To ensure the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`psum_min` is set to INF, `psum` is 0, `ax` is the last element in the updated `avail` list, `l` is `ans + 1`, `r` is either `ans` or `ans + 1`, `ans` remains negative, `n` is the number of iterations in the loop, `x` and `y` are assigned values from `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` arrays respectively, `sp` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is the minimum of `ans` and `x`, and `ep` is decremented if necessary for the loop to execute the first time.**
