Postcondition: ***All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 1, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is updated based on the new value of `x`, the element at the new index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1, and if the new `ep` is less than `ans`, the element at the new index `ep + 1` in the `avail` list is decremented by 1. `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.***
