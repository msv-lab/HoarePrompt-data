Output State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers with the additional value `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers with the additional value `y`, `robbers` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `lights` list has at least 2 elements, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the second element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the second element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is updated to the x-coordinate difference between the second light and the robber, and `y` is updated to the y-coordinate difference between the second light and the robber.**
