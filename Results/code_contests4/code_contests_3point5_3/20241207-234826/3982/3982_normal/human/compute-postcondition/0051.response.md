Example Answer: 
A new non-negative y-coordinate difference `y` is appended to the `rel_lights_y` list. The previous values of `rel_lights_y` are unknown, but now it contains this new value `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers along with the new value of x, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers with the newly appended y-coordinate difference, `robbers` list still has elements, `lights` list has at least 2 elements, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the second element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the second element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers along with the new value of x, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers with the newly appended y-coordinate difference, `robbers` list still has elements, `lights` list has at least 2 elements, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the second element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the second element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0**
