According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` list should have one more element added with a value of 1, `psum_min` should be updated, `psum` should be updated, `ax` should be updated, `l` should be updated, `r` should be updated, `ans` should be greater than or equal to `x + y`, `n` should be greater than 0, `x` should be assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` should be assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` should be calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` should be the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and `ep` should be less than `ans`. Additionally, if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` should be decremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the above conditions must hold true.
State: **All elements in the `avail` list are updated with one more element having a value of 1, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is updated, `ax` is updated, `l` is updated, `r` is updated, `ans` is greater than or equal to `x + y`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `ep` is less than `ans`, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time**
