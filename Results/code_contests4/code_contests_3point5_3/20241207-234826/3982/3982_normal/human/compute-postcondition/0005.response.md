According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `robbers`. If `robbers` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `robbers` is assigned the return value of the function `func_4(n, 2)`, so for the loop to execute the `robbers` list must not be empty. 
State: **`n` is assigned the return value of the function `func_2()`, `m` is assigned the return value of the function `func_2()`, `robbers` is assigned the return value of the function `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is assigned the return value of `func_4(m, 2)`, `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list**
