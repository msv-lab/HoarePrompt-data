The value of `x` is appended to the list `rel_lights_x`. The previous values of `rel_lights_x` contain all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, so after the execution, `rel_lights_x` will have all the previous values along with the new value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.  
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers along with the new value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `robbers` list still has elements, `lights` list has at least 2 elements, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the second element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the second element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0**
