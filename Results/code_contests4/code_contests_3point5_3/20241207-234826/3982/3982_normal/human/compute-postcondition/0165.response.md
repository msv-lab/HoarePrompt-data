`psum_min` is updated to the minimum of the current `psum_min` and `psum`. The minimum value between the two is taken and assigned to `psum_min`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between the current `psum_min` and `psum`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between the current `psum_min` and `psum`**
