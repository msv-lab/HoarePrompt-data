Example Answer:
`psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between the previous `psum_min` and the previous `psum`. The values of `psum_min` and `psum` are dependent on their previous values which are unknown. The `avail` still has at least one more element left for the loop to execute, and `ax` is the next element in `avail`. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is the minimum value between the previous `psum_min` and the previous `psum`, `psum` is the sum of the previous `psum` and the next element in `avail`, `avail` still has at least one more element left for the loop to execute, `ax` is the next element in `avail`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between the previous `psum_min` and the previous `psum`, `psum` is the sum of the previous `psum` and the next element in `avail`, `avail` still has at least one more element left for the loop to execute, `ax` is the next element in `avail`**
