According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `avail` and `ax`. If `avail` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is the minimum value between INF and `ax`, `psum` is the value of `ax`, `avail` is not empty, `ax` is the first element in `avail`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `avail` must still not be empty, and `ax` must be the next element in `avail`.
State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between INF and the next element in `avail`, `psum` is the value of the next element in `avail`, for the loop to execute another time `avail` is still not empty, `ax` is the next element in `avail`**
