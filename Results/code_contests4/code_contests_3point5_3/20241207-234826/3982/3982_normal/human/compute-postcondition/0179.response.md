According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `ans` and `i`. If `i` is less than `ans`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is assigned the value of the middle point between `l` and `r`, and `avail[i]` is now 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, and `avail[ans + 1]` should be assigned 0.
State: **`psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep` remain the same as before, `ans` is still assigned the value of the middle point between `l` and `r` which is at least 0, `avail[i]` is now 0, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is increased by 1, `avail[ans + 1]` is assigned 0**
