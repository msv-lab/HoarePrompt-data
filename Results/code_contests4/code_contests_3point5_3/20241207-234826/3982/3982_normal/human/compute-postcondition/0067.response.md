According to the code, the loop will execute `ans + 1` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `ans` is 5. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `ans + 1`, which means `i` must be less than 6.
State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `robbers` list has been fully iterated through, `lights` list has been fully iterated through, all possible non-negative differences between the coordinates have been appended to `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the last element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the last element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10, a list `avail` is created with zeros of length 10, `ans` is 5, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 6, `avail` list is updated with 0 at index `i`**
