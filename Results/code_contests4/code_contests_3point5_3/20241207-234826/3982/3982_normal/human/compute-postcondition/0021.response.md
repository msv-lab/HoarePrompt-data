Postcondition: ***Output State: `n`, `m`, `robbers`, `lights`, `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, `x`, `y` have their respective assigned values. `robbers` and `lights` are not empty lists. `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0. `rel_lights_x` has an additional value appended to it, `rel_lights_y` has the appended value of `y`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the `lights` list must be selected. After the execution of the code snippet, `x` is assigned the difference between `lx` and `rx`, and `y` is assigned the difference between `ly` and `ry`.***
