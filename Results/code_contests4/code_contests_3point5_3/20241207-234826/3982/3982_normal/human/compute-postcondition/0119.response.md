According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is set to `ans + 1`, `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. So, for the loop to execute again, `ans + 1` needs to be less than `ans` which implies that `ans` is a negative number. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value among all the partial sums in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `avail` list has all its elements processed, `ax` is the last element in the `avail` list. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, `l` is set to `ans + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `ans` is negative**
