According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined within the loop, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0. Since `avail[i]` is 0 for all values of `i` up to `ans`, and `i` reaches `ans + 1`, `avail[ans + 1]` should be adjusted to 0.

State: **Output State: `psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans` remain the same as before, `avail[i]` is 0 for all values of `i` up to `ans`, `i` is 0, `avail[ans + 1]` is 0 for the loop to execute**.
