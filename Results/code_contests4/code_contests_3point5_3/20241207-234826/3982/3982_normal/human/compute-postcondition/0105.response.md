Example Answer:
`psum` is increased by the value of `ax`, which is the first element in the `avail` list. The initial value of `psum` is 0 and `ax` is the first element in the `avail` list. Therefore, after execution, `psum` will be the value of the first element in the `avail` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`psum_min` is INF, `psum` is the value of the first element in the `avail` list, the loop can execute, `avail` list has at least 1 element, `ax` is the first element in the `avail` list**
