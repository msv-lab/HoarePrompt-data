According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` containing non-negative differences between lights and robbers, and the `robbers` list still having elements for the loop to execute another time does not ensure the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `lights` list must have at least 1 element, and `lx` and `ly` should be the x and y coordinates of the first element in the lights list.
State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers, `robbers` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` list has at least 1 element, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first element in the lights list**
