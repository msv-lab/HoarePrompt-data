Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, where `i` is the index used to access the `rel_lights_x` list. The previous values of the affected variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `avail` list are updated with one more element having a value of 1, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is updated, `ax` is updated, `l` is updated, `r` is updated, `ans` is greater than or equal to `x + y`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned a new value based on `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `ep` is less than `ans`, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time.
