Example Answer:
The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are subtracted to calculate `x` and `y`. The previous values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty.
Output State: **Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty**
