Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are assigned the result of subtracting `rx` from `lx` and `ry` from `ly` respectively. The previous values of `lx` and `rx` are unknown, so the values of `x` and `y` cannot be determined. The lists `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` now contain `x` and `y` respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty. `x` and `y` are both greater than or equal to 0. `rel_lights_x` contains `x` as one of its elements, `rel_lights_y` contains `y` as one of its elements, `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`, `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`, the next elements in the lights list are assigned to `lx` and `ly` in the next iteration.
Output State: **Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty. `x` and `y` are both greater than or equal to 0. `rel_lights_x` contains `x` as one of its elements, `rel_lights_y` contains `y` as one of its elements, `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`, `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`, the next elements in the lights list are assigned to `lx` and `ly` in the next iteration**
