Example Answer:
`rel_lights_x` appends the value of `x`, which is the result of `lx - rx`, to the list `rel_lights_x`. The previous state of `rel_lights_x` is not known, so after execution, `rel_lights_x` will have an additional value appended to it.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `robbers`, `lights`, `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, `x`, `y` have their respective assigned values. `robbers` and `lights` are not empty lists. `x` is the result of `lx - rx` and `y` is the result of `ly - ry` for the first tuple in the `lights` list. Additionally, x is greater than or equal to 0 and y is greater than or equal to 0. `rel_lights_x` has an additional value appended to it**
