Example Answer:
The minimum value between `INF` and the updated `psum` is assigned to `psum_min`. `psum` is the updated value after adding the third element in `avail`, and the third element in `avail` is `ax`. Since `psum_min` is assigned the minimum value, it will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is the minimum value between `INF` and the updated `psum`, `psum` is the updated value after adding the third element in `avail`, `avail` list has at least 3 elements, the third element in `avail` is `ax`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between `INF` and the updated `psum`, `psum` is the updated value after adding the third element in `avail`, `avail` list has at least 3 elements, the third element in `avail` is `ax`**
