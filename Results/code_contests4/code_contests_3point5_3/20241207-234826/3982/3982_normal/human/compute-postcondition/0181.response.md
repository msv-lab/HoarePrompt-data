According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ans`. If `i` is less than `ans + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` remains the same. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than `ans + 1`.
State: **`psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans` remain the same, `avail[i]` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `avail[ans + 1]` is now 0, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be less than `ans + 1`**
