According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep` are all variables with specific values and relationships and for the loop to execute again `l` is less than `r`**
