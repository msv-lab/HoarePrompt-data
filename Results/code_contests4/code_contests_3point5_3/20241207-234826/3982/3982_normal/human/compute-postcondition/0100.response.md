Postcondition: ***All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0. `i` is 2. `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`. `sp` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`. `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. If `ep < ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1.***
