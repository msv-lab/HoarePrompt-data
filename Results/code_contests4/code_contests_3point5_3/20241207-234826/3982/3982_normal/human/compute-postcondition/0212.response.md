Postcondition: ***All variables `psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans`, `avail[i]` remain the same. All values of `avail[i]` up to `ans` are 0. `avail[ans + 1]` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1. `x` is now assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. If `x + y >= ans`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1.***
