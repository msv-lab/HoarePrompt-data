Example Answer: 
`psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`. The initial state of `psum_min` is INF and `psum` is the value of `ax`. Therefore, after execution, `psum_min` will be the minimum value between INF and `ax`. 
Output State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between INF and `ax`, `psum` is the value of `ax`, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` is not empty, `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
