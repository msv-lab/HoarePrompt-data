Example Answer:
`psum` is updated by adding the value of `ax`. The values of `psum_min` and `avail` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of the current `psum_min` and `psum`, for the loop to execute again `avail` must have more elements; `psum` is updated by adding the value of `ax`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is updated to the minimum of the current `psum_min` and `psum`, for the loop to execute again `avail` must have more elements; `psum` is updated by adding the value of `ax`**
