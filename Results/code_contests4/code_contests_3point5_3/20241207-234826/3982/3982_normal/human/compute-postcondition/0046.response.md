Example Answer:
`rel_lights_y` will have the y-coordinate difference `y` appended to it. The initial state does not mention the specific values of `rel_lights_y`, so after execution, `rel_lights_y` will have the new y-coordinate difference `y` added to it.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers with the additional value `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers with the additional value `y`, `robbers` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` list has at least 1 element, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0**
