Example Answer:
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. The value of `ans` is unknown, so `ep` could be any value less than or equal to `x`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 0, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`, `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, and `ep` is a value less than or equal to `x`.
Output State: **All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 0, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`, `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, and `ep` is a value less than or equal to `x`**
