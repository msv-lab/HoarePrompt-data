Example Answer:
The element at index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `avail` list are updated with one more element having a value of 1, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is updated, `ax` is updated, `l` is updated, `r` is updated, `ans` is greater than or equal to `x + y`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned a new value based on `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.
Output State: **All elements in the `avail` list are updated with one more element having a value of 1, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is updated, `ax` is updated, `l` is updated, `r` is updated, `ans` is greater than or equal to `x + y`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned a new value based on `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.**
