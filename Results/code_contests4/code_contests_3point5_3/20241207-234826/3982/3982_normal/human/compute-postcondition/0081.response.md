Postcondition: ***All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 0, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`, `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is a value less than or equal to `x`, the element at index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, the element at index `ep + 1` in the `avail` list is decremented by 1.***
