According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `avail`. If there are more elements in the `avail` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of the current `psum_min` and `psum`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `avail` list must have more elements.
State: **`psum_min` is updated to the minimum of the current `psum_min` and `psum`, for the loop to execute again `avail` must have more elements**
