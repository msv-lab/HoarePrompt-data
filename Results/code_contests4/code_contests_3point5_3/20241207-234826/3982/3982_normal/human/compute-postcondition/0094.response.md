Example Answer: 
`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is 2. Since the initial state mentions that `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, after execution, `y` will be updated to the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 2, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`, `sp` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is updated based on the new value of `x`, the element at the new index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1, and if the new `ep` is less than `ans`, the element at the new index `ep + 1` in the `avail` list is decremented by 1. `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`.
Output State: **All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 2, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`, `sp`, `ep`, and other variables are recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`**
