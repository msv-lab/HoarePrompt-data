According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lights list. If the lights list is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the next element to be processed in the robbers list is the first element, lights list is not empty. x and y are both greater than or equal to 0. rel_lights_x contains x as one of its elements and rel_lights_y contains y as one of its elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the lights list must not be empty.
State: **Next element to be processed in robbers list is the first element, for the loop to execute lights list is not empty. x and y are both greater than or equal to 0. rel_lights_x contains x as one of its elements and rel_lights_y contains y as one of its elements.**
