According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If the list is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `lights` list is assigned the return value of `func_4(m, 2)`, so for the loop to execute the first time, the `lights` list must not be empty. Additionally, the loop variables `lx` and `ly` are unpacked from each tuple in the `lights` list, so for the loop to execute the first time, `lx` and `ly` should be the values from the first tuple in the `lights` list.
State: **`n` is assigned the return value of the function `func_2()`, `m` is assigned the return value of the function `func_2()`, `robbers` is assigned the return value of the function `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is assigned the return value of `func_4(m, 2)`, `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` is not empty, `lx` and `ly` are the values from the first tuple in the `lights` list**
