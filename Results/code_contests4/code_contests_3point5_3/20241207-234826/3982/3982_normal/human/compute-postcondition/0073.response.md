Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, where `i` is 0. Since `rel_lights_x` is not provided in the initial state, it is not possible to determine the exact value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
