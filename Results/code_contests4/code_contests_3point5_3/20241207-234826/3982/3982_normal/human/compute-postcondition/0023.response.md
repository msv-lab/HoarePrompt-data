According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are still elements in the `robbers` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `robbers` list is not empty. To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next elements in the `robbers` list.
State: **`n`, `m`, `robbers`, `lights`, `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, `x`, `y` have their respective assigned values. `robbers` and `lights` are not empty lists. All values appended to `rel_lights_x` are the non-negative differences between the x-coordinates of the lights and the robbers. All values appended to `rel_lights_y` are the non-negative differences between the y-coordinates of the lights and the robbers. Next element to be processed in robbers list**
