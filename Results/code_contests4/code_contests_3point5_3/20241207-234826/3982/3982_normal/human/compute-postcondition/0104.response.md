According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `psum_min` is assigned the value `INF` and `psum` is 0 do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute the first time, `avail` list has at least 1 element, `psum_min` remains as `INF`, `psum` remains as 0, and `ax` is the first element in the `avail` list.
State: **`psum_min` is INF, `psum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` list has at least 1 element, `ax` is the first element in the `avail` list**
