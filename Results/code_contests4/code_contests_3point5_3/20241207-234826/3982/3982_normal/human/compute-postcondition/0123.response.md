According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. If `ans` is negative, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is the minimum value among all the partial sums in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `avail` list has all its elements processed, `ax` is the last element in the `avail` list, `psum_min` is not equal to 0, `l` is `ans + 1`, `r` is either `ans` or `ans + 1`, `ans` is negative. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ans` should still be negative.
State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value among all the partial sums in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `avail` list has all its elements processed, `ax` is the last element in the `avail` list, `psum_min` is not equal to 0, `l` is `ans + 1`, `r` is either `ans` or `ans + 1`, `ans` is negative, for the loop to execute one more time `ans` is still negative**
