Example Answer: 
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. The value of `ans` is greater than or equal to `x + y`, so `ep` will be the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `avail` list are 0, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is updated, `ax` is updated, `l` is updated, `r` is updated, `ans` is greater than or equal to `x + y`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.
