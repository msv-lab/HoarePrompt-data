Example Answer:
`y` is appended to the list `rel_lights_y`, which contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers. The value of `y` is the y-coordinate difference between the third light and the robber. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative x-coordinate differences between lights and robbers with the additional value `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative y-coordinate differences between lights and robbers with the additional values `y` appended, `robbers` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `lights` list has at least 3 elements, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the third element in the lights list, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the third element in the lights list, x is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0.**
