Example Answer:
`avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. The value of `ep` was assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and `avail[sp]` was previously incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: All variables remain the same except `ep` which is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `ep` which is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1**
