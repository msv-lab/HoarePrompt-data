According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, all elements in the `avail` list are set to 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0 and `i` needs to be 0.
State: **All elements in the `avail` list are set to 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
