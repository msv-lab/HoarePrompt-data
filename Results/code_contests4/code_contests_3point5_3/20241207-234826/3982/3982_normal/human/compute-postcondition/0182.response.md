Example Answer:
The value of `avail[i]` is updated to 0, where `i` is increased by 1. The condition for the loop to execute another time is that `i` must be less than `ans + 1`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans` remain the same, `avail[i]` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `avail[ans + 1]` is now 0, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be less than `ans + 1`.
Output State: **`psum_min`, `psum`, `ax`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep`, `ans` remain the same, `avail[i]` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `avail[ans + 1]` is now 0, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be less than `ans + 1`**
