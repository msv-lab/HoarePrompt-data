According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is the minimum value between `INF` and the updated `psum`, `psum` is the updated value after adding `ax`, `avail` list has at least 2 elements, `ax` is the second element in the `avail` list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `avail` list must have at least 3 elements, and `ax` is the third element in the list.
State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value between `INF` and the updated `psum`, `psum` is the updated value after adding the third element in `avail`, `avail` list has at least 3 elements, the third element in `avail` is `ax`**
