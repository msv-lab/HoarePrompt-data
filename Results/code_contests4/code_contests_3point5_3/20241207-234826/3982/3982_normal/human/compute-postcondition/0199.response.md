Example Answer:
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. The previous values of `ans` and `x` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ep`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, with the specified changes to `sp` and `avail` array, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, with the specified changes to `sp` and `avail` array, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`**
