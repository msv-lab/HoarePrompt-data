Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration for the given coordinates of robbers and searchlights. The program iterates through all possible non-negative differences between the coordinates of robbers and searchlights, calculates the minimum number of moves required, and prints the result. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for different test cases.
