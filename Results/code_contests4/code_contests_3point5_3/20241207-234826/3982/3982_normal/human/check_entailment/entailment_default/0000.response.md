Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the relative positions of the robbers and searchlights, performs a binary search algorithm to find the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration, and then prints the result. The functions provided seem to work as expected and handle the input and calculations accurately. Additionally, the output hints do not provide any edge cases or scenarios where the code might fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, based on the provided code, description, and output hints, the code is correct.
