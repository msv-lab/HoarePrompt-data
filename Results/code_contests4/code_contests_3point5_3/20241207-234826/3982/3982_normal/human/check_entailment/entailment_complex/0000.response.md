Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem description.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration by iterating through the lists of robbers and lights, calculating the differences in coordinates, and performing a binary search algorithm. The implementation aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
3. The functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to read input, process coordinates, and create lists of robbers and lights, respectively. These functions are utilized correctly in the main function `func_1`.
4. The annotations provided for each function accurately describe the state of the program before and after the function calls, detailing the variables and conditions involved in the calculations.
5. The program overall aligns with the problem description by determining the minimum number of moves required to achieve a safe configuration for the robbers given the searchlights' positions.
