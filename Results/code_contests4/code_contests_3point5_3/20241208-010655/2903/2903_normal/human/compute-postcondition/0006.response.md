Example Answer:
`mn` is assigned the minimum value between `mn` and `s`. The value of `mn` can change based on the comparison. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k`, `s`, `mn` have assigned values based on the input, `a` is a list of integers created from the input, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `mn` is updated with the minimum value between its previous value and `s`.
