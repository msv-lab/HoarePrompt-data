Example Answer:
The value of `s` is updated by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`. The previous values of `s`, `n`, `k`, `mn`, and `i` are not provided, so it is not possible to determine the exact values after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s`, `i` is incremented by 1 and checked against `k`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s`, `i` is incremented by 1 and checked against `k`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s`**
