Example Answer:
n, k, s, mn are assigned values using the map function with input values from `raw_input().split()`. In this case, two additional values 0 and 10000000000 are added to the map, but since they are not used in the assignment, they do not affect the output state. Therefore, the Output State is: n, k, s, mn are assigned values based on the input.
Output State: **n, k, s, mn are assigned values based on the input**
