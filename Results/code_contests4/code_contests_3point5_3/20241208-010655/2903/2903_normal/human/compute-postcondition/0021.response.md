The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to calculate and return the missing integer in a list of integers `a` where there are `w-1` elements and each element is between 0 and 10^4. The constraints are that `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5.
