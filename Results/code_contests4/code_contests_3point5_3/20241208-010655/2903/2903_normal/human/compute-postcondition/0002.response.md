According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, the loop will execute at least once, so `n` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, `k`, `s`, `mn` are not used in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 0, so it should be included in the state.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k`, `s`, `mn` are assigned values based on the input, `a` is a list of integers created from the input, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
