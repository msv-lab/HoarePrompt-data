Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The previous value of `s` is unknown, so the new value of `s` will depend on the value of `a[i]`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s`, `i` is incremented by 1 and checked against `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s`, `i` is incremented by 1 and checked against `k`**
