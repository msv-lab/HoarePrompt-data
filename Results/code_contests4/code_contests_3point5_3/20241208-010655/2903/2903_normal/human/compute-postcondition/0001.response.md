Example Answer: 
A list `a` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `mn` are assigned based on the input, but they are not directly affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `s`, `mn` are assigned values based on the input; `a` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `mn` are assigned values based on the input; `a` is a list of integers created from the input**
