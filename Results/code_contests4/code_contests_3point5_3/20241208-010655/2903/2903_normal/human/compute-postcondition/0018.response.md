Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s` are incremented by the value of `a[i]`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s`, `i` is incremented by 1 and checked against `k`. If the condition i < k is true, the same operations are repeated. If i is not less than k, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s` again.***
