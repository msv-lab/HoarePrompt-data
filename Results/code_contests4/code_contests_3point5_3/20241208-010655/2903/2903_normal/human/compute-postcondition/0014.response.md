According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `n`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `s`, `mn`, and `a` are integers and a list of integers respectively. If `i` is less than `k`, then `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, `mn` is updated with the minimum value between its previous value and `s`, `s` is updated with the sum of `a[i]` and the negative value of `a[i - k]`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n`, `k`, `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `s`, `i` is incremented by 1 and checked against `k`.**
