Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `mn` are integers and `a` is a list of integers. If `i` is less than `k`, then `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, `mn` is updated with the minimum value between its previous value and `s`, `s` is updated with the sum of `a[i]` and the negative value of `a[i - k]`.***
