Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the minimum value between `mn` and `s`. Since the values of `mn` and `s` are not modified in the provided code snippet, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `mn` are integers and `a` is a list of integers. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `s` will contain the sum of elements in the list `a`, `mn` will contain the minimum value of the sum of elements in `a` with a window size of `k`.**
