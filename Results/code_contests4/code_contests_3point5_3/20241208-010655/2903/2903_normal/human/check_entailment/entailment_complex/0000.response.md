Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values as specified in the problem description. It then iterates over the elements of the list `a`, calculating the sum of elements in `a` and keeping track of the minimum value of the sum of elements in `a` with a window size of `k`. After all iterations, it prints the minimum value between `mn` and `s`, which is the correct output as required by the problem description.

The program correctly implements the logic of using the stones to help the frogs cross the river. It calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river based on the available stones and the constraints provided. The output produced by the program aligns with the expected output for the given problem.
