Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description. The program is supposed to determine the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river using the stones. However, the code does not seem to calculate this correctly. The output hints describe the functionality of the code, which involves updating `s` and `mn` based on certain conditions. The code seems to miss the logic required to accurately determine the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river by using the stones. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the problem description for all potential cases.
