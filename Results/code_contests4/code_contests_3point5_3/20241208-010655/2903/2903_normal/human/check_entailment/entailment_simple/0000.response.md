Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river by utilizing the stones. It iterates through the list of stones and calculates the sum of stones within the frog's jumping range. It also keeps track of the minimum sum of stones within a window of size `k`. Finally, it prints the minimum of the total sum of stones and the minimum sum within the window, which represents the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river.

The program follows the problem description accurately by considering the limitations of the frog's jump length and the availability of stones at specific distances from the bank. It calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river by efficiently using the stones.
