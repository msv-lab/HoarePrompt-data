The function `func` reads input values `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` from the user, along with a list of integers `a`. It then iterates over the elements of `a`, updating `s` and `mn` based on certain conditions. After all iterations, it prints the minimum value between `mn` and `s`. The functionality also requires `w` and `l` to be integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5.
