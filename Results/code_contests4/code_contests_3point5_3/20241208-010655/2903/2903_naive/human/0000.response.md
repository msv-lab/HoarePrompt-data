Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river by utilizing the stones. The code iterates through the distances from the bank where the stones are located and calculates the total distance covered by the frogs. It ensures that each stone is used only once and keeps track of the minimum distance required to cross the river. The code then returns the minimum of the total distance covered and the minimum distance required, which is the correct approach to solve the given problem. The logic implemented in the code is accurate and covers all potential cases, making it a correct solution.
