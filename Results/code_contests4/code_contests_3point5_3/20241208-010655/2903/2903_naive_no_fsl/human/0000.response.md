Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the given problem. It fails to consider all possible combinations of stones that frogs can jump on to cross the river. It only considers the stones within a distance of k units from the starting point of the frog, which is not necessarily optimal for maximizing the number of frogs crossing the river.

An example where the program fails is for the following input:

Input
```
10 5
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
```

Expected Output
```
4
```

Explanation
In this case, there are stones at distances 2, 4, 6, and 8 units from the starting point. Each frog can jump on a stone and cross the river. However, the program provided does not account for this scenario and will output an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible cases as described in the problem description.
