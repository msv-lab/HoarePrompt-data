Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `A` is a list containing tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`, `n` is a positive integer, `selected` contains the second elements of the tuples in list `A` until the sum of the first elements in the selected tuples is greater than or equal to `s`. If the sum of the first elements in `selected` is less than `s`, then `selected` will contain all the second elements of the tuples in `A`.**
