Example Answer:
`A` is updated to include the tuple (2^k, i+1), where k is the current value of k and i is incremented by 1. `s` is incremented by 2^(k+1). `n` remains unchanged. If i is not equal to 1 and k equals i-1, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, there is no else part in the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is updated to include the tuple (2^k, i+1), `s` is incremented by 2^(k+1), `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`A` is updated to include the tuple (2^k, i+1), `s` is incremented by 2^(k+1), `n` remains unchanged**
