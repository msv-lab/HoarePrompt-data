Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is incremented by the first element of the last tuple in `A`. Since `A` is updated to include the tuple (2^k, i+1), and `s` is incremented by 2^(k+1), the last tuple in `A` would be (2^k, i+1). Therefore, `s` will be incremented by 2^k. The value of `n` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`A` is updated to include the tuple (2^k, i+1), `s` is incremented by 2^(k+1) and 2^k, `n` remains unchanged**
