Postcondition: ***`A` is a list containing tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`, `n` is a positive integer, `selected` contains the second element of the first tuple in list `A`, for the loop to execute the first time `A` has at least 1 tuple, `tup` is the first tuple in list `A`, `target` is decreased by the smallest first element in list `A`. The `target` is less than or equal to 0***
