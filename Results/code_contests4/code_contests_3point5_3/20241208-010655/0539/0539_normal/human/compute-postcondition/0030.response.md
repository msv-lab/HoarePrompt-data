Example Answer: 
The value of `target` is decreased by the first element of the tuple `tup`. As `tup` is the first tuple in list `A`, and `A` is sorted in ascending order based on the first element, the first element of `tup` is the smallest in the list. Therefore, after execution, the value of `target` is decreased by the smallest first element in list `A`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`A` is a list containing tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`, `n` is a positive integer, `selected` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `A` has at least 1 tuple, `tup` is the first tuple in list `A`, `target` is decreased by the smallest first element in list `A`**
