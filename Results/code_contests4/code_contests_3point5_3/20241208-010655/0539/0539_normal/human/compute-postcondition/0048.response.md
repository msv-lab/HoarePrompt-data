The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 and are less than the given limit. The function should handle the case where the sum exceeds the given limit by returning the limit itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 up to the given limit, ensuring that the sum does not exceed the limit.
