Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(2 ** k, i)` to the list `A`. The value of `k` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values being appended. However, if `k = i - 1`, then `(2 ** (i - 1), i)` will be appended to `A`. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` includes the updated tuple, `s` is incremented by the specified values, `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`A` includes the updated tuple, `s` is incremented by the specified values, `n` remains unchanged**
