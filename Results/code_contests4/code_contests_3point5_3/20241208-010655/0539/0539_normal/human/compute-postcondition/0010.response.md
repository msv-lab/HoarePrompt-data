According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `A` is a list containing tuples where the first element is 2 raised to the power of the value assigned to `k` and the second element is the value of `i`.
- `s` is incremented by the first element of the last tuple in list `A`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
1. Increment `i` by 1.
2. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `k` is equal to `i - 1`, then `k` is assigned the value of `int(math.log(i, 2))`.

State: **`A` is updated to include the tuple (2^k, i+1), `s` is incremented by 2^(k+1), `n` is unchanged. If i is not equal to 1 and k is equal to i, then k is assigned the value of int(math.log(i+1, 2))**
