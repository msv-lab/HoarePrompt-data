According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `A`. If `A` has at least 1 tuple, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `selected` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is a positive integer, and `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `tup` should be the first tuple in list `A`.

State: **`A` is a list containing tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`, `n` is a positive integer, `selected` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `A` has at least 1 tuple, `tup` is the first tuple in list `A`**
