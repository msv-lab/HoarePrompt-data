Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `A` is a list containing tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`, `n` is a positive integer, `selected` contains the second element of the first tuple in list `A` and the first element of `tup`, `tup` is the first tuple in list `A`, `target` is decreased by the smallest first element in list `A` and `target` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, `selected` now contains the second element of the first tuple in list `A` and the first element of `tup`. If target is less than or equal to 0, the loop stops.***
