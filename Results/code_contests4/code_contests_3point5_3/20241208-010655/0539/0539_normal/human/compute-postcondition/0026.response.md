Postcondition: ***`A` is a list containing tuples where the first element is 2 raised to the power of the value assigned to `k` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, the second element is the value of `i`, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`, `n` is a positive integer. If the sum `s` of the first elements of tuples in list `A` is less than `target`, then the state remains unchanged.***
