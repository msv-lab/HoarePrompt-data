Example Answer:
`target` and `n` are assigned values from the split input. The values of `target` and `n` are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: sum and limit are integers such that 1 <= sum, limit <= 10^5; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the split input.
Output State: **sum and limit are integers such that 1 <= sum, limit <= 10^5; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the split input**
