Example Answer:
The value of `k` is calculated as `(i & -i) - 1`, where `&` is a bitwise AND operator and `-i` is the two's complement of `i`. The value of `A` includes the tuple `(2^(k+1), i+2)`, so it will be updated based on the new value of `k`. The value of `s` is incremented by `2^(k+2)` and `2^(k+1)`, so it will also be updated. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` includes the updated tuple, `s` is incremented by the specified values, `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`A` includes the updated tuple, `s` is incremented by the specified values, `n` remains unchanged**
