Example Answer:
The value of `k` is calculated as the integer value of the logarithm base 2 of `i`. The value of `i` is not provided, so the value of `k` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is updated to include the tuple (2^k, i+1), `s` is incremented by 2^(k+1), `n` is unchanged.
Output State: **`A` is updated to include the tuple (2^k, i+1), `s` is incremented by 2^(k+1), `n` is unchanged**
