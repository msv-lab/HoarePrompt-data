Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by the first element of the last tuple in list `A`. The state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` includes the updated tuple, `s` is incremented by the specified value, `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`A` includes the updated tuple, `s` is incremented by the specified value, `n` remains unchanged**
