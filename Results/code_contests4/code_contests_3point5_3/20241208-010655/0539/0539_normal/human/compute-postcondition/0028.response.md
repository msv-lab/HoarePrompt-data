Example Answer:
`selected` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `A`, `s`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list containing tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`, `n` is a positive integer, `selected` is an empty list.
Output State: **`A` is a list containing tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in list `A`, `n` is a positive integer, `selected` is an empty list**
