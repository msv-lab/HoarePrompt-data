Output State: **`A` is a list containing tuples where the first element is 2 raised to the power of the value assigned to `k` and the second element is the value of `i`, `s` is incremented by the first element of the last tuple in list `A`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `k` is equal to `i - 1`, then `k` is assigned the value of `int(math.log(i, 2))`**
