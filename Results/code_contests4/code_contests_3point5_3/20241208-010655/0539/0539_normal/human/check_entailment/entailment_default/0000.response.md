Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads the input sum and limit, creates a list of tuples where the first element is 2 to the power of the position of the first one in the binary representation of the index, and the second element is the index. It then sorts the list based on the first element of the tuples and selects elements from the list until the sum is reached. The output includes the number of selected elements and the selected elements. The code correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description and provides a valid output for all potential cases. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness.
