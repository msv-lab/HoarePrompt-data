Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It constructs a set `S` based on the conditions given in the problem statement and outputs the elements of the set in the required format. The logic used in the program ensures that the set `S` satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem description.

The program calculates the values of `k` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and constructs tuples of the form `(2**k, i)`. It then sorts these tuples based on the first element and selects elements from the sorted list until the sum of the first elements is greater than or equal to the target sum `s`.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides a valid solution for constructing the set `S`.
