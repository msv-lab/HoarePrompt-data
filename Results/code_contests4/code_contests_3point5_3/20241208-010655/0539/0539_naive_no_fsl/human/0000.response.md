Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding a set S that satisfies all the given conditions. It checks for all possible elements in the set and ensures that the sum of the elements equals the target sum. The logic for generating the set S based on lowbit calculation is implemented correctly. The program also handles the case where it is impossible to find a suitable set by outputting -1. Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
