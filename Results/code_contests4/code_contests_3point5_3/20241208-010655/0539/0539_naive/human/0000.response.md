Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly generates a set S that satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem description. It calculates the lowbit of each number from 1 to n, checks if the sum of lowbit values is greater than or equal to the target, sorts the values, and selects the elements to form the set S. The program covers all possible scenarios and provides a valid set S if it exists, otherwise it returns -1. The logic of the program follows the problem description accurately.
