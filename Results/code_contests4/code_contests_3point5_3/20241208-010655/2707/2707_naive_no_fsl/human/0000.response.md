Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for n, n1, n2, and the list of wealth values.
2. It sorts the wealth values in non-decreasing order.
3. It calculates the sum of wealth values for the first city (s1) by considering the wealthiest n1 individuals.
4. It calculates the sum of wealth values for the second city (s2) by considering the wealthiest n2 individuals from the remaining candidates.
5. Finally, it calculates the arithmetic mean of wealth values for each city and prints the sum of these means.
6. The program handles all potential cases by considering the optimal way to pick residents for the two cities based on the given constraints, ensuring the maximum possible sum of arithmetic means of wealth for the cities.
