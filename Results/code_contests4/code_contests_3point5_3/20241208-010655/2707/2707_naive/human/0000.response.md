Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for the number of candidates, the planned number of residents for the first city, the planned number of residents for the second city, and the wealth of each candidate.
2. The program sorts the wealth of candidates in ascending order.
3. It calculates the sum of wealth for the first city by considering the wealthiest n1 candidates, and the sum of wealth for the second city by considering the next wealthiest n2 candidates.
4. Finally, it calculates the maximum possible sum of arithmetic means of wealth of cities' residents and prints the result with the required precision.
5. The program handles all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description, ensuring that the division is done in real numbers without any rounding.
