Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers as input, sorts the second integer to be smaller than the third if initially greater, calculates the sum of the last `n1` elements in the sorted list `a`, then calculates the sum of the last `n2` elements in `a`, and finally prints the average of these two sums divided by their respective counts `n1` and `n2`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
