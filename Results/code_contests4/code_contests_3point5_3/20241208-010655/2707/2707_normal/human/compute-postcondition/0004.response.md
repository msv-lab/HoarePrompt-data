Example Answer:
`n1` and `n2` are swapped using tuple unpacking. After the swap, `n1` now holds the value that was in `n2`, and `n2` holds the value that was in `n1`. Since the values were in ascending order, `n1` is still greater than `n2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order. `n1` is greater than `n2`.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order. `n1` is greater than `n2`**
