Example Answer:
The list `a` is created by converting each element from the input split by spaces into integers. Since `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers, after execution, the list `a` will contain those input integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers, `a` is a list containing those input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers, `a` is a list containing those input integers**
