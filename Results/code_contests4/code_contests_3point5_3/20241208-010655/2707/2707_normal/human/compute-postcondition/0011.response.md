According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the updated value after adding the value at index `n - 1`, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n1` should be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the updated value after adding the value at index `n - 1`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n1` must be greater than 2**
