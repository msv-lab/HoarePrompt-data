According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n2`. If `i` is less than `n2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements in list `a`, `s2` is the sum of elements calculated by the loop, `i` is the number of iterations completed in the loop, and `n2` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `s2` should be updated based on the loop body calculations for the next iteration.
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the completion of one more iteration.
- The condition to check if the loop can execute again should be evaluated based on the updated `i` and `n2`.

State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements in list `a`, `s2` is updated with the new sum, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be less than `n2`**
