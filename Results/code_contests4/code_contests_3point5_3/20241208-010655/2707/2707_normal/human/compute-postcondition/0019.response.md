According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n2`. If `i` is less than `n2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements in list `a`, `s2` is updated with the new sum, `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than `n2` after being incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements in list `a`, `s2` is updated with the new sum, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be less than `n2 + 1**
