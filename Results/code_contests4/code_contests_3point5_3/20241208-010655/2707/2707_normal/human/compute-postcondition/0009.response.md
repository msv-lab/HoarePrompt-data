According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the updated value, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the updated value, `i` is 1**
