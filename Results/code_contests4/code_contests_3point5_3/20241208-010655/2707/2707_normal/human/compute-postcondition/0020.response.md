Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements in list `a`, `s2` is updated with the new sum which includes the sum of the element at index `n - n1 - i - 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be less than `n2 + 1**.
