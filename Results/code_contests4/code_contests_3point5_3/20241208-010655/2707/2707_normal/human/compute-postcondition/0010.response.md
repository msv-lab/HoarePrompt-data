Example Answer:
`s1` is updated by adding the value at index `n - i - 1` in list `a`. Since `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, and `i` is 1, `s1` will be updated by adding the value at index `n - 1` in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the updated value after adding the value at index `n - 1`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the updated value after adding the value at index `n - 1`, `i` is 1**
