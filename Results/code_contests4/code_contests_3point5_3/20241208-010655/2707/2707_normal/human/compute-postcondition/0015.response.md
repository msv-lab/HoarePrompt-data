According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n2`. If n2 is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values that need to be adjusted are:
- `s2` needs to be adjusted to 0
- `i` needs to be adjusted to 0
- `n`, `n1`, and `n2` need to be adjusted to input values
State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements in list `a`, `s2` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n2` is greater than 0**
