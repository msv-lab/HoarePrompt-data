Example Answer:
The value of `s2` is updated by adding the element at index `n - n1 - i - 1` in list `a`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again if it is less than `n2`. The states of `n`, `n1`, `n2`, `a`, `s1` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements in list `a`, `s2` is updated with the new sum, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be less than `n2`**
