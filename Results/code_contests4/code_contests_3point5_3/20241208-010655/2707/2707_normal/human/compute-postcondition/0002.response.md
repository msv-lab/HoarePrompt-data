Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are already stored in the list `a`, so after sorting, the list `a` will contain the integers in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are input integers stored in list `a` in ascending order**
