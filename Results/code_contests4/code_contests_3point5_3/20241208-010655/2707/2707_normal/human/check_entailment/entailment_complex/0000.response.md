Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input integers, sorts them, and then calculates the sum of the last `n1` elements and `n2` elements in the sorted list. Finally, it prints the average of these two sums divided by their respective counts `n1` and `n2`, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the correct output.
