Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes the input values, sorts the wealth values in ascending order, and then calculates the sum of the last `n1` elements for the first city and the sum of the last `n2` elements for the second city. It then calculates the arithmetic mean of wealth for each city and prints the sum of those arithmetic means.

The program ensures that the subset of candidates chosen for each city is the one that maximizes the sum of arithmetic means of wealth in the cities. Therefore, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
