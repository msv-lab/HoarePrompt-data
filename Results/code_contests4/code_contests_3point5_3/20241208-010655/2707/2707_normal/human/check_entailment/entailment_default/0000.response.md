Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints suggest that the code calculates the sum of the last `n1` elements in the sorted list `a` and then the sum of the last `n2` elements in `a`. However, the code does not handle the case when `n1` and `n2` are equal. In this scenario, the code should distribute the candidates evenly between the two cities, but the code does not account for this case. This means that the code does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
