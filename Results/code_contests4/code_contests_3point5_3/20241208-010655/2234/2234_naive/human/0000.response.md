Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. It only checks if a string is a substring of another string within the given list, but it does not ensure that all strings before a particular string are its substrings. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where a string should not be placed before another string. 

For example, consider the input:
5
a
abacaba
ba
aba
abab

The program will incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if a string is a substring of another string, not if all strings before it are substrings. In this case, "abab" is not a substring of "abacaba", so the program should output "NO".
