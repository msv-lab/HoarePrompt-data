Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases. The program is supposed to check if it is possible to reorder the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings. However, the code does not account for the fact that some strings might be substrings of other strings, which is a crucial aspect of the problem.

In the case where a string is a substring of another string, the code only counts the occurrences of the substring within the other string, rather than considering the fact that the substring should be placed before the other string in the reordered list.

Therefore, the code is not correct as it fails to handle cases where strings are substrings of other strings in the list, leading to incorrect reordering of the strings.
