You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given n strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.

String a is a substring of string b if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in b in such a way that they form a. For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of strings.

The next n lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from 1 to 100, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.

Some strings might be equal.

Output

If it is impossible to reorder n given strings in required order, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and n given strings in required order.

Examples

Input

5
a
aba
abacaba
ba
aba


Output

YES
a
ba
aba
aba
abacaba


Input

5
a
abacaba
ba
aba
abab


Output

NO


Input

3
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty


Output

YES
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty

Note

In the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string "abab" is not a substring of the string "abacaba".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- Each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters.
- The number of letters in each string is from 1 to 100, inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    ls = []
    while t > 0:
        a = raw_input()
        
        ls.append(a)
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the values of all `a` inputs from `raw_input()`, `t` is 0
    dict1 = {}
    for x in ls:
        count = 0
        
        for z in ls:
            if x in z:
                count = count + 1
        
        dict1[x] = count
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `ls` contains the same values as before, `dict1` is a dictionary with key `x` and value `count` where count is the number of times `x` appears in the list `ls`.
    sorted_x = sorted(dict1.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))
    sorted_x.reverse()
    c2 = 0
    for item in sorted_x:
        if item[1] == 1:
            c2 = c2 + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: c2 is the count of tuples in sorted_x where the second element is equal to 1
    if (c2 > 1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        for x in sorted_x:
            c1 = ls.count(x[0])
            
            for z in range(c1):
                print(x[0])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in each tuple of sorted_x have been printed c1 times, c2 is 0, x is the last element in sorted_x, c1 is the count of the last element of list ls and c1 is greater than 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *c2 is the count of tuples in sorted_x where the second element is equal to 1. If c2 > 1, the code prints 'NO'. Otherwise, all elements in each tuple of sorted_x have been printed c1 times, c2 is 0, x is the last element in sorted_x, c1 is the count of the last element of list ls, and c1 is greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input and then reads `t` strings. It then processes these strings to count the occurrences of each string within the list of strings. After processing, it determines whether there is only one unique occurrence of a string and prints 'YES' if so, 'NO' otherwise. If there are multiple unique occurrences, it prints each string the number of times it appears in the list. The function does not accept any parameters and is meant to handle a list of strings with lowercase English letters, with the number of strings between 1 and 100 inclusive, and each string having a length between 1 and 100 inclusive.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
