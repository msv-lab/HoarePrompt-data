Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully implement the requirements of the problem description. The program is checking if each string is a substring of any other string in the list, but it is not reordering the strings to meet the specified conditions. It is only checking for unique occurrences of strings and printing them accordingly.

The program should rearrange the strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings. The current implementation does not achieve this. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
