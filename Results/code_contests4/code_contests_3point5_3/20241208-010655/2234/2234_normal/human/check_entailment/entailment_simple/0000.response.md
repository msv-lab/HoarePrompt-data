Correctness: **True**

The program reads n strings, counts the number of times each string is a substring of other strings, sorts them based on the count, and then prints the strings in the required order. If there is more than one string that is not a substring of any other string, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the reordered strings.

The program correctly rearranges the strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings. It checks all possible combinations of substrings and correctly determines if the strings can be reordered according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
