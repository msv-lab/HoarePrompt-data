According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sorted list `sorted_x`. If there are more elements in the sorted list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times, `c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls` and `c1` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements in the sorted list `sorted_x`.
State: **All elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times, `c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls` and `c1` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in the sorted list `sorted_x`**
