According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ls` is an empty list. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` needs to be adjusted such that it is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time t is greater than 0**
