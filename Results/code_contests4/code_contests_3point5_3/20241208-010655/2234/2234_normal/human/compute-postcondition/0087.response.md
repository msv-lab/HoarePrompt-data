Example Answer:
The count of the first element in the list `ls` is assigned to `c1`. The value of `c1` changes based on the count of the first element in the list `ls`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls`, all elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times.
Output State: **`c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls`, all elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times**
