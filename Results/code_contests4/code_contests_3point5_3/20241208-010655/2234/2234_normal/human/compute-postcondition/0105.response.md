Postcondition: ***c2 is the count of tuples in sorted_x where the second element is equal to 1. If c2 > 1, the code prints 'NO'. Otherwise, all elements in each tuple of sorted_x have been printed c1 times, c2 is 0, x is the last element in sorted_x, c1 is the count of the last element of list ls, and c1 is greater than 0.***
