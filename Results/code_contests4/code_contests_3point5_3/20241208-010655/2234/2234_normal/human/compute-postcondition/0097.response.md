According to the code, the loop will execute `c1` times, so the value of `c1` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the sorted list `sorted_x`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **All elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times, `c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls` and `c1` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in the sorted list `sorted_x`.**
