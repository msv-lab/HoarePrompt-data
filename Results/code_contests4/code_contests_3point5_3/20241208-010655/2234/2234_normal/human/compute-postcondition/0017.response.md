Example Answer:
`count` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `ls` contains at least one value, `x` is the first value in the list, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `ls` contains at least one value, `x` is the first value in the list, `count` is 0**
