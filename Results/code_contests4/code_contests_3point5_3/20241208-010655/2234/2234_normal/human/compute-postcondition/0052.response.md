Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `dict1` is a dictionary with key `x` and value `count`, `ls` contains at least one more value, `z` is the next value in the list, `count` is incremented by 2, `x` is the next value in the list after `z`. The element `x` is in the first element of the list `z` if `x` is in `z`.***
