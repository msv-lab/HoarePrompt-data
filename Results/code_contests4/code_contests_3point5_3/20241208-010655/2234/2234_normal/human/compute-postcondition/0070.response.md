Example Answer:
c2 is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 2. Therefore, after execution, c2 becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, t is 0, ls contains the same values as before, dict1 is a dictionary with key x and value count, sorted_x is not empty, the value of the second element of the next tuple in sorted_x is 1 if item[1] == 1, c2 is 3**
