Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts user input as a string. The value of `n`, `ls`, and `t` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`, `t` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`, `t` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1**
