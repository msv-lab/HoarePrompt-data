According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`, `t` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1**
