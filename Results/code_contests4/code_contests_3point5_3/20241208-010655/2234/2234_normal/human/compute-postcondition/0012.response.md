Example Answer:
`a` is appended to the list `ls`. The previous values of `ls` are not provided, so the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ls` contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`, `t` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ls` contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`, `t` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1**
