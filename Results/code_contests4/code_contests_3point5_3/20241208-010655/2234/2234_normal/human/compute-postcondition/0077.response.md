According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sorted_x`. If `sorted_x` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the condition `c2` is less than or equal to 1, and 'YES' is printed. So, for the loop to execute, the `sorted_x` must have at least 1 element, and `c2` is now 0 and x is the first element in the list.
State: **`c2` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `sorted_x` has at least 1 element, x is the first element in the list**
