Example Answer:
`t` is decreased by 1. The value of `t` before the operation is unknown, but it is known that `t` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ls` contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`, `t` is greater than 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ls` contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`, `t` is greater than 1**
