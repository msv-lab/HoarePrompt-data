Example Answer:
`t` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `t` is unknown, but since it is being decremented, we can assume it was initialized to some positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `t` will be decreased by 1. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`, `t` is decreased by 1**
