According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `c1` and `z`. If `z` is less than `c1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c2` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, `c1` is the count of the first element of list `ls`, for the loop to execute `c1` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `z` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`c2` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, `c1` is the count of the first element of list `ls`, for the loop to execute one more time `c1` is greater than 0, `z` is 1**
