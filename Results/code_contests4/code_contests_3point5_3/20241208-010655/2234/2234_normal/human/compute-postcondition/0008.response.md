Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value from `raw_input()` and then appended to the list `ls`. The value of `t` is not affected, and `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the values of `a` input from `raw_input()`**
