Example Answer:
A new empty list `ls` is created. Since `ls` was initially empty, the creation of the list does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls is an empty list.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls is an empty list**
