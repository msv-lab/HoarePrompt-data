Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `t` is greater than 0, so after execution, `t` will have a new value one less than the previous value. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the value of `a`, `t` is greater than 0 and one less than its previous value.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the value of `a`, `t` is greater than 0 and one less than its previous value**
