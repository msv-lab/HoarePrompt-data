Example Answer:
`c1` is assigned the value of the count of the first element of list `x` in list `ls`. The value of `c1` is greater than 0, so the loop will execute one more time. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times, `c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls` and `c1` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in the sorted list `sorted_x`.
Output State: **All elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times, `c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls` and `c1` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in the sorted list `sorted_x`**
