Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which is then appended to the list `ls`. Since `ls` was initially empty, after execution, `ls` will contain the value of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the value of `a`, t is greater than 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the value of `a`, t is greater than 0**
