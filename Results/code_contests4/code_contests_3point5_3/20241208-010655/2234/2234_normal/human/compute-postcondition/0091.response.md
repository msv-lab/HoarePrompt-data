Example Answer: 
The code prints the first element of list `x`. Since `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, and the first element of `x` has been printed, the output will be the first element of the sorted list `sorted_x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls` and `c1` is greater than 0, all elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times, the first element of list `x` is printed, `z` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls` and `c1` is greater than 0, all elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times, the first element of list `x` is printed, `z` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
