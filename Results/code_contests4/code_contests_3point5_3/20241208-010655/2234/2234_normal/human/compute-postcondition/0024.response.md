Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the second time `ls` contains at least two values, `z` is the second value in the list, `count` is 3. If x is in z, then count is updated to 3. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
