According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and one less than its previous value. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, ls contains the value of `a`, `t` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again t is greater than 1**
