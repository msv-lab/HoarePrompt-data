Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `dict1` is a dictionary with key `x` and value `count`, `ls` contains at least one more value to iterate over, `z` is the second last value in the list, `count` is incremented by 3, for the loop to execute one more time there is at least one more value in `ls`, and `x` is in `z`.***
