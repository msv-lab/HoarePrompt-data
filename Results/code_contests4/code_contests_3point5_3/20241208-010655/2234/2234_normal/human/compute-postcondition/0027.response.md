Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the third time `ls` contains at least two values, `z` is the third value in the list, `count` is 4 if `x` is in `z`. Otherwise, the state remains the same as before the execution of the if else block.***
