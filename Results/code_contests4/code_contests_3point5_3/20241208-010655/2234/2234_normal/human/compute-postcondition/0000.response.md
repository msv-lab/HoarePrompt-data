Example Answer:
t is assigned the value of int(raw_input()), where raw_input() accepts an input and int() converts it to an integer. The value of n is constrained to be between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100**
