Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `ls` contains the same values as before, `dict1` is a dictionary with key `x` and value `count`, `sorted_x` is a list of tuples sorted based on the values of the dictionary `dict1` in reverse order, `c2` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time sorted_x is not empty, item is the first tuple in sorted_x. The value of the second element of `item` is 1.***
