According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sorted list `sorted_x`. If there are more elements in the sorted list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c2` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, `c1` is the count of the first element of list `ls`, and all elements in the first element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements in the sorted list `sorted_x`, and the state should reflect the next element in the sorted list.
State: **`c2` is 0, `x` is the next element in the sorted list `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the next element of list `ls`, all elements in the next element of list `x` have been printed `c1` times**
