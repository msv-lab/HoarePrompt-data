Example Answer:
`c1` is assigned the count of the first element of list `ls` stored in variable `x`. The value of `x` comes from the initial state that `x` is the first element in the list. The initial state also mentions that `sorted_x` has at least 1 element, so `x` is valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `c2` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, `c1` is the count of the first element of list `ls`.
Output State: **`c2` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, `c1` is the count of the first element of list `ls`**
