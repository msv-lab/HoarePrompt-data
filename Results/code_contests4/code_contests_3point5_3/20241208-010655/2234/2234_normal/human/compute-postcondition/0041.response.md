Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 0, `dict1` is a dictionary with key `x` and value `count`, `ls` contains at least one more value to iterate over after `z`, `z` is the second last value in the list, `count` is incremented by 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be in the next value after `z` in `ls`.***
