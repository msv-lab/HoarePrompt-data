Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input and then reads `t` strings. It then processes these strings to count the occurrences of each string within the list of strings. After processing, it determines whether there is only one unique occurrence of a string and prints 'YES' if so, 'NO' otherwise. If there are multiple unique occurrences, it prints each string the number of times it appears in the list. The function does not accept any parameters and is meant to handle a list of strings with lowercase English letters, with the number of strings between 1 and 100 inclusive, and each string having a length between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
