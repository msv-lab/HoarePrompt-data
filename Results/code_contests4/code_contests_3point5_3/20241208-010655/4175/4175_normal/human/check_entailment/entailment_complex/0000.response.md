Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values N, M, R, r, a, b, and c, then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path. Finally, it computes the minimum cost based on permutations of the given inputs and prints the result as an integer. The program follows the requirements outlined in the problem description and outputs the distance traveled by road when Joisino visits the towns in the order that minimizes it.
