Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the distance traveled by road if Joisino visits the towns in the order that minimizes it. It first reads the input values, then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between towns. Finally, it calculates the minimum distance by iterating through all permutations of the towns visited and summing the distances between them.

This program follows the problem description and will always output the correct distance traveled by road for any given input.
