Example Answer:
The lambda function `f` is called and the values returned by the lambda function are assigned to variable `r`. The initial state does not provide information about the values returned by the lambda function, so the output state is: `N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function**
