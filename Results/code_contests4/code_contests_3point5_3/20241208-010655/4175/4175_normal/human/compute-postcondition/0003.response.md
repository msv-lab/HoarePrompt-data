Example Answer:
The `map` function applies the lambda function `f` to the list `[0] * M`, where `M` is the value returned by the lambda function. The result is then passed to the `zip` function, which groups the elements by index. Since the values returned by the lambda function are stored in `N`, `M`, and `R`, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the result of zipping the mapped values**
