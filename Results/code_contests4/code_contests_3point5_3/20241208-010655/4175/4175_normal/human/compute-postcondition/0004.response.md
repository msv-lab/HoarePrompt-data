Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the result of `csgraph.dijkstra(csr_matrix((c, (a, b)), [N + 1] * 2), 0, r)`, where `N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the result of zipping the mapped values. The values of `N`, `M`, and `R` are used in the function parameters. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the result of zipping the mapped values, and `a` is the result of the dijkstra function.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the result of zipping the mapped values, and `a` is the result of the dijkstra function**
