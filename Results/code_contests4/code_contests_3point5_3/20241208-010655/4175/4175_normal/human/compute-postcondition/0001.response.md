Example Answer:
`N`, `M`, and `R` are assigned values returned by the lambda function `f()`. The lambda function converts input to a list of integers. Therefore, after execution, `N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function**
