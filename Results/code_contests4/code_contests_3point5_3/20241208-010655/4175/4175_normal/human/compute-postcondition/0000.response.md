Example Answer:
The lambda function `f` is defined to take input, split it, convert each element to an integer, and return a list of integers. This lambda function does not execute immediately, it just defines the functionality. Therefore, the output state is: `f` is a lambda function that converts input to a list of integers.
Output State: **`f` is a lambda function that converts input to a list of integers**
