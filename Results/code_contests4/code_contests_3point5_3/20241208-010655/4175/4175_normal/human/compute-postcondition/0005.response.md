Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `R` hold the values returned by the lambda function, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the result of zipping the mapped values, and `a` is the result of the dijkstra function. The code calculates the minimum sum of distances for all permutations of `R` elements and prints the integer value of this minimum sum. No variables are directly affected by this code snippet.**
