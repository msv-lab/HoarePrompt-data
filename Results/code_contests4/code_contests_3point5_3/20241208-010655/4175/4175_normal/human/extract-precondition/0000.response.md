**Precondition:**

N, M, R are integers such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 200, 1 ≤ M ≤ N×(N-1)/2, 2 ≤ R ≤ min(8, N).
r_i is a non-repeating integer representing the towns Joisino visits.
A_i, B_i, C_i are integers representing the towns connected by roads and the length of the road between them.
1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N, A_i ≠ B_i.
1 ≤ C_i ≤ 100000.
Every town can be reached from every town by road.
