Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that reads the input data, processes it to find the participant who caught the maximum number of fish along with the corresponding value, and prints them. The function correctly handles the input format as described in the problem statement. It iterates through the input pairs of participant numbers and the number of fish caught, keeping track of the participant with the highest number of fish caught. It also considers the case where there are multiple winners and outputs the one with the lowest participant number, as required.
The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct in finding the winner based on the number of fish caught and the participant number. The code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
