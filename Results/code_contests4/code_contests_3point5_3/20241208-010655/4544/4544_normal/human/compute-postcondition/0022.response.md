Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an input parameter `readline`, which represents the input data. The input data consists of a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by `n` pairs of integers `ai` and `vi`, where `ai` is the participant number and `vi` is the non-negative integer representing the number of fish caught by participant `ai`. The function processes this input data, finds the participant who caught the maximum number of fish along with the corresponding value, and prints them. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
