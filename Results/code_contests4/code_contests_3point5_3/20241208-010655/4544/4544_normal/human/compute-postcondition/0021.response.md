The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `readline`, which represents the input data. The input data consists of a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 20, followed by `n` pairs of integers `ai` and `vi`, where `ai` is the participant number and `vi` is the non-negative integer representing the number of fish caught by participant `ai`. The function processes this input data and does not return any value explicitly.
