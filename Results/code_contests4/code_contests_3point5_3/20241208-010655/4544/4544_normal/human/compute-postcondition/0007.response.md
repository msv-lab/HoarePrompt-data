Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `ai` is an integer representing the participant number, `vi` is a non-negative integer representing the number of fish caught by participant `ai`, `value` holds the number of fish caught by participant `ai`, `number` is assigned the maximum possible integer value, for the loop to execute the first time the input value obtained from `readline()` should be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is assigned the integer value obtained from the first element of the input, `v` is assigned the integer value obtained from the second element of the input. If `v` is greater than `value`, or if `v` is equal to `value` and `a` is less than `number`, then the state of the program is updated accordingly.***
