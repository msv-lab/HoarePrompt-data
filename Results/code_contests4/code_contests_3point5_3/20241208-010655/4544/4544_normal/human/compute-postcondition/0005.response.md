Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `ai` is an integer representing the participant number, `vi` is a non-negative integer representing the number of fish caught by participant `ai`, `value` is -1, `number` is assigned the value obtained from the first element of the input, for the loop to execute the first time the input value obtained from `readline()` should be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is assigned the integer value obtained from the first element of the input, `v` is assigned the integer value obtained from the second element of the input. Additionally, after entering the if condition (v > value or (v == value and a < number)), the program's state is such that v is greater than value or v is equal to value and a is less than number.**
