Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `ai` is an integer representing the participant number, `vi` is a non-negative integer representing the number of fish caught by participant `ai`, `value` holds the number of fish caught by participant `ai`, `number` is assigned the integer value obtained from the first element of the input, for the loop to execute the third time the input value obtained from `readline()` should be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is assigned the integer value obtained from the first element of the input, `v` is assigned the integer value obtained from the second element of the input, `a` and `v` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input. `value` is assigned the value of `v`. If `v` is greater than `value`, or if `v` is equal to `value` and `a` is less than `number`, then the program updates the `value` to `v`.***
