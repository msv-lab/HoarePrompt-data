Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program reads the input as described in the problem statement. It then iterates through the participants, keeping track of the participant number with the highest number of fish caught. If there are multiple participants with the same number of fish caught, it selects the one with the lowest participant number. Finally, it prints the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught, which aligns with the problem description.

There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected, so the correctness is True.
