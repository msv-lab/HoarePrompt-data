The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function does not have any input parameters. The function calculates and returns the maximum possible number of different colors that can be obtained by mixing red, green, and blue colors. The function calculates this based on the constraints that the values of r, g, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to calculate and return the maximum possible number of different colors that can be obtained by mixing red, green, and blue colors within the given constraints.
