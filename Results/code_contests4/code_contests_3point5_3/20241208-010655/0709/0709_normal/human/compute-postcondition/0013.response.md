Example Answer:
The value of `at_start` is set to False. This does not affect the values of `r`, `g`, `b`, or `sep`. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9, `at_start` is False, the value of `sep` is written to the file.
Output State: **`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9, `at_start` is False, the value of `sep` is written to the file**
