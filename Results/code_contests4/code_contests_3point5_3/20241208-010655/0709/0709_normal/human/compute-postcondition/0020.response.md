Example Answer:
The `pop` method removes and returns the value of the key 'end' from the `kwargs` dictionary if it exists, otherwise it returns the default value '\n' and writes it to the file. Since `end` is not specified in the initial state, the default value '\n' is written to the file. The initial state variables `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9. `at_start` is False. All elements in the list `args` have been written to the file as strings separated by the value of `sep`.**
