Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file using the `write` method. The values of `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, and `sep` remain unchanged. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `args`. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9. `at_start` is False, the value of `sep` is written to the file, and `x` is written to the file as a string.
