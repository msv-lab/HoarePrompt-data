Example Answer:
The code snippet `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` is trying to pop the values of 'sep' and 'file' from the dictionary `kwargs` with default values of ' ' and `sys.stdout` respectively. Since the initial state does not provide information about the content of `kwargs`, we cannot determine the exact values of `sep` and `file` after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: r, g, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9.
Output State: **r, g, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9**
