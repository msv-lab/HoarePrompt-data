According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `args`. If `args` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `args` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element processed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `args` must still be non-empty and `x` should be the next element in the list.
State: **`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute the next time `args` is a non-empty list and x is the next element in the list**
