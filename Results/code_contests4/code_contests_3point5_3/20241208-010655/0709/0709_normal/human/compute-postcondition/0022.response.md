Example Answer:
The `flush()` method is called on the file object, which flushes the internal buffer, causing the data to be written to the file. The 'flush' keyword argument has been popped from `kwargs` with a value of True, indicating that the buffer should be flushed. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9. `at_start` is False. All elements in the list `args` have been written to the file as strings separated by the value of `sep`. The 'flush' operation has been performed.
