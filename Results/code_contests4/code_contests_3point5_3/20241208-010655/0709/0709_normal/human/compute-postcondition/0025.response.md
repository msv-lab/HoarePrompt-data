Functionality: **The function func_2 does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in the list `args`, converts them to strings, and writes them to the output file separated by the value of `sep`. It then writes the value specified by the keyword argument 'end' to the file. If the keyword argument 'flush' is True, it flushes the stream. The function does not calculate or return the maximum possible number of different colors that can be obtained by mixing red, green, and blue colors.**
