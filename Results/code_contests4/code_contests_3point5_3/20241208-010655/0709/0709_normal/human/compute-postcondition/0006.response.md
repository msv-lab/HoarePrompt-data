Postcondition: ***`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9. `at_start` is True. For the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty list and x is the first element in the list. If not at_start, no changes occur in the variables `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, `args`, x. The function `file.write(sep)` is called, but the effect on the program depends on the value of `sep`.***
