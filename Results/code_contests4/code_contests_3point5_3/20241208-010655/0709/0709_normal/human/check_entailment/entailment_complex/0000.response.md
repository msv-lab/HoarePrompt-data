Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes three integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons as input.
2. It then calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with the given balloons based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
3. The calculations involve sorting the input values, determining the number of tables based on the least number of balloons, and adjusting the counts accordingly.
4. The code seems to cover all possible cases and edge cases mentioned in the annotations such as handling different combinations of colors to maximize the number of tables.
5. The output of the program matches the expected output for the provided examples.
6. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
