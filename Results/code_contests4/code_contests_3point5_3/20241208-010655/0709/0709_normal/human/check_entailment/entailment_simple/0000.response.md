Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated according to the problem description. It takes the input values for the number of red, green, and blue balloons, sorts them, and then calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated. The logic in the program ensures that three balloons of the same color are not attached to a single table.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
