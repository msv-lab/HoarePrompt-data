Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads three integers `r`, `g`, and `b` from input, sorts them, and calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner. 
- It ensures that each table has exactly 3 balloons with different colors.
- The calculations are based on distributing the balloons in an optimal way to maximize the number of tables that can be decorated.
- The code covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.
- The output hints do not provide any conflicting information with the code.
