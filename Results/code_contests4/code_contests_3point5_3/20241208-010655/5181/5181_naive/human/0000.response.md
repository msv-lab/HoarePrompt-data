Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the good string that can be obtained. It simply adds the values of `a` and `b` and then adds `2 * c`, which is not the correct approach.

For example, if the input is `2 1 2`, the correct output should be `7` because the optimal string is "abababa". However, the given program would output `5` because it calculates `2 + 1 + 2*2 = 5`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
