Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible length of the good string that can be obtained by choosing a subset of strings "a", "b", and "ab" and concatenating them in any arbitrary order. The program calculates this length by adding the counts of strings "a" and "b" and then adding twice the count of string "ab". This logic is consistent with the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
