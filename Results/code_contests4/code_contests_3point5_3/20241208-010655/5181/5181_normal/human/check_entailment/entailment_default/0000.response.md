Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. For example, if all three types of strings are concatenated together, the code will output the sum of a and b added to 2 times c, which is not necessarily the maximum possible length of the good string that can be obtained. The code does not consider the fact that 'ab' strings can be placed in between 'a' and 'b' strings to create longer good strings. Therefore, the code does not work as expected for all cases described in the problem.
