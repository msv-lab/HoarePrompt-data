Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It simply calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and adds twice the value of `c`, which does not correspond to the task of finding the maximum length of the good string that can be obtained by concatenating the given strings. Additionally, there is a syntax error in the print statement where the addition operation is not properly enclosed in parentheses, which will lead to an error.

Therefore, the program does not produce the correct output as required by the problem description.
