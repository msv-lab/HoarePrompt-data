Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers a, b, and c from the user input and prints the sum of a and b added to 2 times c. However, the code has an issue where the addition operation for a and b is not properly enclosed in parentheses, leading to incorrect output. Additionally, the function does not explicitly return any value. **
