Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, then adds twice the value of `c` to it. Since the initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, the sum of `a` and `b` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, the output state is the sum of `a` and `b` added to twice the value of `c`.
Output State: **sum of `a` and `b` added to 2 times `c`**
