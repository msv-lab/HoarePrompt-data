Example Answer:
The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the input values obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since the values are positive integers and satisfy the given constraints, the output state is:
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9**
