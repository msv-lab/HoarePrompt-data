Example Answer:
`nf` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is increased by 1, `nf` is a string input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is increased by 1, `nf` is a string input**
