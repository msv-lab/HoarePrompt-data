Example Answer:
`maxi` is updated by adding the product of `cs[-i - 1]` and `counts[-i - 1]`. The values of `cs` and `counts` are not given, so the updated value of `maxi` cannot be calculated accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `buy` is a dictionary, `counts` is a sorted list, `maxi` is updated, `mini` is updated with the calculated value, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `buy` is a dictionary, `counts` is a sorted list, `maxi` is updated, `mini` is updated with the calculated value, `i` is 1**
