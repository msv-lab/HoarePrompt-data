According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100. Since the loop iterates over `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is increased by 1**
