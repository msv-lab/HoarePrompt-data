According to the code, the loop will execute as long as m is at least 1. Before the loop starts, n and m are positive integers, so they already meet the condition for the loop to execute. The dictionary buy is empty which implies that there are no key-value pairs in it. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, and `buy` is an empty dictionary.
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, `buy` is an empty dictionary**
