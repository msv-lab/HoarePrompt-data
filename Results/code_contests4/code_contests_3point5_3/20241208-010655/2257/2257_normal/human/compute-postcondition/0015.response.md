Example Answer:
`mini` is assigned the value 0. The variables `n`, `m`, `buy`, `counts`, and `maxi` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, `buy` is a dictionary containing all unique `nf` values inputted with their respective counts, `counts` is a sorted list of values from the `buy` dictionary, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, `buy` is a dictionary containing all unique `nf` values inputted with their respective counts, `counts` is a sorted list of values from the `buy` dictionary, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is 0**
