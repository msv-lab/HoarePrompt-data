Example Answer:
`buy` dictionary is updated with the value of `nf` incremented by 1 or added with value 1 if `nf` is not already present. The value of `nf` is provided as input, so the value of `nf` is updated in the `buy` dictionary. The value of `i` is increased by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, `i` is increased by 2, `nf` is the string input, `buy` dictionary is updated with key `nf` incremented by 1 or added with value 1 if `nf` is not already present.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, `i` is increased by 2, `nf` is the string input, `buy` dictionary is updated with key `nf` incremented by 1 or added with value 1 if `nf` is not already present**
