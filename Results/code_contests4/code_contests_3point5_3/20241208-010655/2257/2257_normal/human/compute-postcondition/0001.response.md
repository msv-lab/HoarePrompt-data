Example Answer:
The code sorts a list created by converting the input to integers. The input is split by spaces, so the list will have the values in increasing order. As the initial states of `n` and `m` are not directly used in the code, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100**
