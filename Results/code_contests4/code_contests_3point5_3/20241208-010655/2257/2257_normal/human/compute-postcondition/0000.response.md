Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values by mapping integers obtained from user input. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100**
