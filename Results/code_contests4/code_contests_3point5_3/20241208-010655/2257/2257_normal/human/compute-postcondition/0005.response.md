Example Answer:
`buy[nf]` is assigned the value of `buy.get(nf, 0) + 1`. If `nf` is not in the `buy` dictionary, it is added with a value of 1. If `nf` is already in the `buy` dictionary, its value is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `buy` are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, `buy` is a dictionary containing `nf` with a count of occurrences.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100, `buy` is a dictionary containing `nf` with a count of occurrences**
