Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the values of `mini` and `maxi` using string formatting. The values of `mini` and `maxi` are calculated based on the sums of the product of elements in `cs` and `counts` from the beginning and end respectively. Since the initial state does not provide information about the values of `cs` and `counts`, the specific values of `mini` and `maxi` cannot be determined.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `buy` is a dictionary, `counts` is a sorted list, `maxi` and `mini` are not defined**
