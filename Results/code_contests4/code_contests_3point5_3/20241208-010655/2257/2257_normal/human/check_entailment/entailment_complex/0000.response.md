Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the number of fruits and their prices, stores the count of each fruit in a dictionary, calculates the minimum and maximum total price for the fruits bought based on their counts and prices, and then prints these values. It follows the problem description accurately by providing the minimum and maximum total cost for the inputted fruit counts and prices. The program correctly calculates the total cost by considering the most "lucky" and "unlucky" distributions of price tags for the fruits.
