Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, `alen` is not greater than `blen` or `alen` is greater than or equal to `blen`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]`, the program returns the string symbol '>'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
