Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits, `alen` is not greater than `blen` or `alen` is greater than or equal to `blen`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is less than `allen` and `j` is less than `bllen`. The character at position `i` in string `a` is greater than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`. Additionally, the character at position `i` in string `a` is not greater than the character at position `j` in string `b`***.
