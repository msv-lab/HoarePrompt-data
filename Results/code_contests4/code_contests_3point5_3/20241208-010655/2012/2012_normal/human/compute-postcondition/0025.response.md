Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. `alen` is not greater than `blen` or `alen` is greater than or equal to `blen`. `i` and `j` are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, either `i` needs to be less than `alen - 1` and `j` needs to be less than `blen`, or `i` has to be less than `alen` and `j` has to be less than `blen - 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]`, the program returns the character '>'.***
