Output State: **'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits. 'alen' is not greater than 'blen' or 'alen' is greater than or equal to 'blen'. If 'a' is less than 'b' based on lexicographical order, the program returns '<'. If 'a' is greater than 'b' based on lexicographical order, the program returns '>'. If 'a' is equal to 'b' based on lexicographical order, the loop will terminate when the end of the shorter string is reached.**
