Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits. `alen` is not greater than `blen` or `alen` is greater than or equal to `blen`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is less than `allen` and `j` is less than `bllen`. The `i`-th character of string `a` is less than the `j`-th character of string `b`***
