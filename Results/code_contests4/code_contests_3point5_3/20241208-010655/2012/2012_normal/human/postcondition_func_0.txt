The function `func_1` compares two non-negative integers represented as strings `a` and `b` with no more than 10^6 digits. It returns '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b` based on lexicographical order. The function also handles the case where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different by returning the corresponding symbol.
