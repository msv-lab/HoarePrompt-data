Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is called twice without being defined beforehand, which results in a NameError. Additionally, the code reads input using `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. Furthermore, the code does not handle cases where the two numbers have leading zeros properly. This can lead to incorrect comparison results.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and needs to be revised to properly compare the two numbers while taking into account the leading zeros.
