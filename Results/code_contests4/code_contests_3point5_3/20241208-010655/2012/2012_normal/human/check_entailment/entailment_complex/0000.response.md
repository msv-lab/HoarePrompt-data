Correctness: **True**

The annotated program compares two non-negative integers represented as strings `a` and `b` with no more than 10^6 digits. It correctly determines whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b` based on lexicographical order. It also handles the case where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different by returning the corresponding symbol ('>', '<', or '='). The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
