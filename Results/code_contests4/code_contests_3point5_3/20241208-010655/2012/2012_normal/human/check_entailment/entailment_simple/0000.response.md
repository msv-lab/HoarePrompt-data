Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly compares two very long integers represented as strings by iterating over each digit and comparing them. It returns the appropriate symbol '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison result as stated in the problem description. The program handles cases where the numbers have leading zeroes and ensures that the comparison is done based on lexicographical order. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
