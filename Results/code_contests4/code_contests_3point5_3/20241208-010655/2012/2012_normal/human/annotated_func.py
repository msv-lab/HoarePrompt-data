'alen' is not greater than 'blen' or 'alen' is greater than or equal to 'blen'. If 'a' is less than 'b' based on lexicographical order, the program returns '<'. If 'a' is greater than 'b' based on lexicographical order, the program returns '>'. If 'a' is equal to 'b' based on lexicographical order, the loop will terminate when the end of the shorter string is reached.

    #The program returns '='
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` compares two non-negative integers represented as strings `a` and `b` with no more than 10^6 digits. It returns '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b` based on lexicographical order. The function also handles the case where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different by returning the corresponding symbol.
