Correctness: True

Explanation: The program reads two very long integers a and b as strings and then removes any leading zeroes. It then compares the lengths of the two strings to determine which number is greater, and if they are of equal length, it compares the individual digits to determine the result. The program correctly handles the cases where a < b, a > b, and a = b based on the problem description. Additionally, the program efficiently reads the input as whole lines rather than character by character, which is suitable for large input sizes.
