Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program reads two very long integers a and b and compares them. It first removes any leading zeroes from both numbers and then compares their lengths. If the lengths are not equal, it directly compares the lengths and returns the appropriate symbol. If the lengths are equal, it compares the digits of the numbers one by one from left to right and returns the appropriate symbol. The program also handles cases where the numbers are equal.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and covers all potential cases mentioned in the description. It compares the numbers correctly in all scenarios and provides the expected output.
