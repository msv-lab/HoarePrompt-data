The function accepts two positive integer parameters `be` and `en`, and uses a binary search algorithm to find the maximum integer `be` such that `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`. It then prints the products `be * x` and `be * y`. If no suitable `be` can be found, it may print `0` for the products if the initial values of `be` and `en` do not allow for any valid integer to be found.
