Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer less than `e`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, and `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`. If `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, then `be` is equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `mid` is updated to `(be + (mid - 1) + 1) // 2` and `en` is equal to `mid - 1`.***
