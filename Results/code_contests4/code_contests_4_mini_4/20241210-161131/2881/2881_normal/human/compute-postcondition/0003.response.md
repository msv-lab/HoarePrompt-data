The variable `be` is assigned the value of `mid`. The previous value of `mid` is calculated as `(b * e + e * n + 1) // 2`. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state reflects the updated value of `be` and the unchanged conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer less than `e`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `mid` is equal to `(b * e + e * n + 1) // 2`, `be` is equal to `(b * e + e * n + 1) // 2`, and the current values of `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`.**
