Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer less than `e`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, and `mid` equals `(be + en + 1) // 2`. If `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`, then `be` is updated to `mid` while `be` remains less than `en`. Otherwise, `en` is decreased by 1, while `be` is less than `en`.***
