According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `be` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `be` is less than `en`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, no adjustments are necessary to the variables since the condition `be < en` is already satisfied.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer less than `e`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`, `be` is less than `en`**
