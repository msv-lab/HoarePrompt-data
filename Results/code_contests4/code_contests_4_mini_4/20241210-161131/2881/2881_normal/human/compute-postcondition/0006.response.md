Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer less than `e`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, and `mid` is equal to `(b * e + e * n + 1) // 2`. If `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`, then the conditions hold. Otherwise, if it is not the case that `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, then `mid` is equal to `(b * e + e * n + 1) // 2`, and `en` is equal to `((b * e + e * n + 1) // 2) - 1`.***
