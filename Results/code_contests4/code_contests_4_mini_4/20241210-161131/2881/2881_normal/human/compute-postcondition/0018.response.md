The code snippet prints the values of `be * x` and `be * y`. The initial state mentions that `be` is equal to a maximum integer such that `x * be <= a` and `y * be <= b`. This indicates that `be` is a valid and determined value based on the given conditions. The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

After executing the print statement, the output will be two calculated products: `be * x` and `be * y`.

Output State: **`be` is equal to the maximum integer such that `x * be <= a` and `y * be <= b`; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer; `x` is a positive integer; `y` is a positive integer; printed values are `be * x` and `be * y`.**
