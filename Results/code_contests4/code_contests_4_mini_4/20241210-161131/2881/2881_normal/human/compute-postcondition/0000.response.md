According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. For the loop to execute, `be` must be less than `en`. Right before the loop, `be` is equal to `b` (which is a positive integer) and `en` is equal to `e` (which is also a positive integer). To ensure that the loop can execute, we need `b` to be less than `e`. 

Since `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are all positive integers and do not provide any specific values for `be` or `en`, we need to ensure that `b` is less than `e` for the loop to run at least once.

State: **a, b, x, and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9 and b must be less than e**
