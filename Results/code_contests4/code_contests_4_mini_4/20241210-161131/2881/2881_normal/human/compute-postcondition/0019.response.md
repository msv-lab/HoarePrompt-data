The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `be` and `en`. Both `be` and `en` are positive integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ `be`, `en` ≤ 2·10^9. The function does not specify a return value in the provided output. Therefore, we cannot describe the return value based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `be` and `en`, which are positive integers.**
