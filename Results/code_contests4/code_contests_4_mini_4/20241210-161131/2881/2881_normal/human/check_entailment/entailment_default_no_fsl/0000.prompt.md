You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Reca company makes monitors, the most popular of their models is AB999 with the screen size a × b centimeters. Because of some production peculiarities a screen parameters are integer numbers. Recently the screen sides ratio x: y became popular with users. That's why the company wants to reduce monitor AB999 size so that its screen sides ratio becomes x: y, at the same time they want its total area to be maximal of all possible variants. Your task is to find the screen parameters of the reduced size model, or find out that such a reduction can't be performed.

Input

The first line of the input contains 4 integers — a, b, x and y (1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·109).

Output

If the answer exists, output 2 positive integers — screen parameters of the reduced size model. Output 0 0 otherwise.

Examples

Input

Output

1920 1080


Input

1 1 1 2


Output

0 0
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
from sys import stdin
from fractions import gcd

rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(a, b, x, y) = rints()
g = gcd(x, y)
x //= g
y //= g
mi = min(a // x, b // y)
print(mi * x, mi * y)

def func_1(be, en):
    while be < en:
        mid = (be + en + 1) // 2
        if x * mid <= a and y * mid <= b:
            be = mid
        else:
            en = mid - 1
    print(be * x, be * y)


```
Output hints: The function accepts two positive integer parameters `be` and `en`, and uses a binary search algorithm to find the maximum integer `be` such that `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`. It then prints the products `be * x` and `be * y`. If no suitable `be` can be found, it may print `0` for the products if the initial values of `be` and `en` do not allow for any valid integer to be found.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
