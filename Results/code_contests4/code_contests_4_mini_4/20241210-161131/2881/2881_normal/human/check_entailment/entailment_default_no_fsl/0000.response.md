Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the required aspect ratio cannot be achieved, which is evident in the example input `1 1 1 2`. In this case, the expected output is `0 0`. However, based on the code, it only checks the maximum possible integer that can fit within the dimensions, and there is no check for whether a valid configuration exists before printing the results.

Specifically, when the input is `1 1 1 2`, the program will attempt to compute the maximum scale factor `mi`, which will be `0` since `1 // 1 = 1` and `1 // 2 = 0`. Consequently, it will print `0 0`, which is correct. However, this is not guaranteed due to the lack of a condition to handle cases where the aspect ratio would mean the dimensions cannot be achieved at all.

In summary, the program lacks a comprehensive validation for all potential cases, particularly the scenario where the aspect ratio is impossible given the input dimensions. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
