To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the program implementation.

### Problem Requirements
1. The program is required to reduce the dimensions of a monitor (a Ã— b) to a new size that maintains the aspect ratio of x: y.
2. The new dimensions must be maximized while remaining within the original dimensions.
3. The output should provide the new dimensions or indicate that the reduction is not possible (outputting 0 0).

### Program Analysis
- The program begins by reading four integers (a, b, x, y) from the input.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y to simplify the ratio. 
- It then computes the maximum integer factor (mi) such that the new dimensions (mi * x) and (mi * y) fit within the original dimensions (a and b).
- Finally, it prints the calculated dimensions based on the factor mi.

### Verification of Logic
1. The simplification of x and y by their gcd ensures that the aspect ratio is maintained in its simplest form.
2. The calculation of `mi` as `min(a // x, b // y)` correctly determines the maximum integer factor that can be applied to both dimensions without exceeding the original dimensions.
3. If `mi` is zero, the program does not output valid dimensions and instead returns (0, 0), which matches the requirement of indicating that a reduction cannot be performed.

### Missing Function
- The program also contains a function `func_1`, but it appears to be unnecessary for the main logic since the required functionality is already implemented without it. The function does not seem to be called anywhere in the program.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It calculates the new dimensions based on the maximum possible integer factor while maintaining the aspect ratio and ensuring that the dimensions do not exceed the original size. It also handles the case where no valid dimensions can be produced by outputting (0, 0).

### Final Assessment
Correctness: **True** 

The program meets all the requirements of the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid input cases.
