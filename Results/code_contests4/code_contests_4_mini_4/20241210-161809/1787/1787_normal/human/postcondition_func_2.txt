The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, and two lists `fact` and `ifact` which contain precomputed factorials and their modular inverses, respectively. It calculates and returns the value of `t`, which is derived from the formula `(fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod) % mod`. The function assumes that `0 <= r <= n` and that the lists `fact` and `ifact` are appropriately populated for the given inputs.
