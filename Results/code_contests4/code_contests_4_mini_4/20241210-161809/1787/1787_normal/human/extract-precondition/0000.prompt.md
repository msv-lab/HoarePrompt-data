You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!

A password is an array a of n positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index i such that 1 ≤ i < n and a_{i} ≠ a_{i+1}, delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array and put a_{i}+a_{i+1} in their place. 

For example, for array [7, 4, 3, 7] you can choose i = 2 and the array will become [7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.

Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 1. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 0) of operations?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the password.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the initial contents of your password.

The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

Example

Input


2
4
2 1 3 1
2
420 420


Output


1
2

Note

In the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of 1:

Pick i=2 to get [2, 4, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [6, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [7]

In the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid i that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.
Program:
```
def func_7(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
```
