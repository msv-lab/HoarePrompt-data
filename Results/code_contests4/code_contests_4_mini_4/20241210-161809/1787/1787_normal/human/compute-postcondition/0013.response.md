The code `ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod` assigns a new value to `ifact[100002]`. The previous value of `i` is `100003`, so `i - 1` is `100002`. The new value of `ifact[100002]` is calculated as `100003 * ifact[100003] % mod`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mod` is a positive integer, `fact` is a list containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo `mod`, `i` is 100003, `ifact` is a list of length 100005 with `ifact[100004]` equal to `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`, `ifact[100003]` is equal to `100004 * ifact[100004] % mod, and `ifact[100002]` is equal to `100003 * ifact[100003] % mod`.**
