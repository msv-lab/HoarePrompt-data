According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop will execute as long as `y` is a truthy value, which for integers means that `y` must be greater than 0. Right before the loop, both `x` and `y` are positive integers, so `y` is already greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **x and y are positive integers**
