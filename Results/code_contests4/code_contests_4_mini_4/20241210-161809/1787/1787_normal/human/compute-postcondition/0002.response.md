According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is now equal to `x % y`. Since both `x` and `y` are positive integers, `x % y` will yield a non-negative integer. 

However, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be greater than 0. Given that `y` is now equal to `x % y`, we must ensure that the value of `y` is not zero. Therefore, `x` must be adjusted so that `x % y` is non-zero. This means that `x` should not be a multiple of the current value of `y`.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can run one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`x` is now equal to `y`, `y` is now equal to `x % y`, and `x` must not be a multiple of the current value of `y`**
