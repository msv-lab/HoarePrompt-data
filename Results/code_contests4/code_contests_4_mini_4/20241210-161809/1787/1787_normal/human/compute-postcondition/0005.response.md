The code executes a tuple assignment where `x` is assigned the previous value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the value of `x % y`. Since `y` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `x` is equal to the previous value of `y`, we can denote the previous values as follows:

Let the previous value of `y` be `y_prev`, then before the execution:
- `x = y_prev`
- `y >= 1`

After executing `x, y = y, x % y`, we get:
- `x` will now hold the previous value of `y`, which is `y_prev`.
- `y` will be assigned the value of `x % y_prev`.

Since `x` was previously equal to `y_prev`, we can represent the new value of `y` as `y = y_prev % y_prev` which equals `0` if `y_prev` is equal to `y_prev`, but since `y` must be greater than or equal to `1`, we know `y` cannot be `0`.

Thus, `y` will take the value of `y_prev % y`, which will be `0` if `y` and `y_prev` are equal.

The final output state will be:
- `x` is equal to the previous value of `y`.
- `y` is now `0`, but since `y` must be greater than or equal to `1`, this implies the logical condition fails.

Therefore, the only valid state is:
Output State: **`x` is equal to the previous value of `y`, `y` is now `0` but must be greater than or equal to `1`.**
