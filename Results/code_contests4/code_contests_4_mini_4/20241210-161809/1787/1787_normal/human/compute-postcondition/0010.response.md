According to the code, the loop will execute if the starting index `i` is within the specified range of the loop. The loop is defined to iterate from `100004` down to `1`, inclusive. 

Since `i` is already set to `100004`, it is within the range of the loop, and the loop can execute. The list `ifact` must also be appropriately initialized, but it is already indicated that its length is `100005` and that `ifact[100004]` has been initialized correctly.

However, to ensure clarity in the state before the loop starts, we need to note that `i` will be decremented in the first iteration. Thus, before the first iteration of the loop, `i` is `100004`, which is valid for the loop. 

State: **`mod` is a positive integer, `fact` is a list containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo `mod`, `i` is 100004, `ifact` is a list of length 100005 with all elements initialized to 0, `ifact[100004]` is equal to `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`**
