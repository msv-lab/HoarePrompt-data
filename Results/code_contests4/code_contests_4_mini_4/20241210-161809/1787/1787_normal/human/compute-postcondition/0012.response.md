According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 100004. The loop decrements `i` by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased to 100003.

State: **`mod` is a positive integer, `fact` is a list containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo `mod`, `i` is 100003, `ifact` is a list of length 100005 with `ifact[100004]` equal to `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`, `ifact[100003]` is equal to `100004 * ifact[100004] % mod**.
