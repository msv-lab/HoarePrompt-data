To analyze the provided code snippet, let's break down the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `mod` is a positive integer.
- `fact` is a list containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo `mod`.
- `i` is 100002.
- `ifact` is a list of length 100005 with:
  - `ifact[100004]` equal to `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`.
  - `ifact[100003]` equal to `100004 * ifact[100004] % mod`.
  - `ifact[100002]` equal to `100003 * ifact[100003] % mod`.

The code snippet:
```
ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
```
This line assigns the value of `i * ifact[i] % mod` to `ifact[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 100002, this means we will calculate `ifact[100001]`.

Now, let's evaluate the specific calculation:
- `i` is 100002,
- `ifact[i]` is `ifact[100002]`, which was previously defined as `100003 * ifact[100003] % mod`.

Therefore, the value assigned to `ifact[100001]` becomes:
```
ifact[100001] = 100002 * ifact[100002] % mod
```
The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State:
**`mod` is a positive integer; `fact` is a list containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo `mod`; `i` is 100002; `ifact[100004]` is equal to `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`; `ifact[100003]` is equal to `100004 * ifact[100004] % mod`; `ifact[100002]` is equal to `100003 * ifact[100003] % mod`; `ifact[100001]` is equal to `100002 * ifact[100002] % mod`.**
