Output State: **`y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, since the loop runs until `y` becomes 0. If the original value of `y` was greater than 0, then the loop executed at least once. If the original value of `y` was 0, the loop does not execute, and `x` remains unchanged.**
