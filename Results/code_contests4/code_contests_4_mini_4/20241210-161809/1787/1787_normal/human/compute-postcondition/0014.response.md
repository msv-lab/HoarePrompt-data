According to the code, the loop is set to iterate from 100004 down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 100003, which is still greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to 100002. 

Since `i` is currently 100003, the next value of `i` will be 100002. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1. 

The other variables (`mod`, `fact`, and `ifact`) do not change with respect to the loop's execution, as they are not affected by the loop's iteration. They remain the same in the context provided.

State: **`mod` is a positive integer, `fact` is a list containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo `mod`, `i` is 100002, `ifact` is a list of length 100005 with `ifact[100004]` equal to `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`, `ifact[100003]` is equal to `100004 * ifact[100004] % mod, and `ifact[100002]` is equal to `100003 * ifact[100003] % mod`.**
