The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It initializes two lists, `fact` and `ifact`, where `fact` contains the first 100005 factorial values modulo a given positive integer `mod`, and `ifact` contains the modular inverses of these factorial values. After executing the function body, it returns the list `fact` and the list `ifact`, both constructed based on the defined relationships and calculations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to compute and return the lists `fact` and `ifact` based on the factorial values and their modular inverses.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the list 'fact' containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo 'mod', and the list 'ifact' where each entry is computed as described.**
