Output State: **`mod` is a positive integer, `fact` is a list containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo `mod`, `i` is 0, `ifact` is a list of length 100005 where `ifact[0]` is equal to `1`, `ifact[1]` is equal to `1`, `ifact[2]` is equal to `2 * ifact[1] % mod`, ..., `ifact[100004]` is equal to `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`, and each `ifact[k]` for `k` from 0 to 100004 is computed as `k * ifact[k + 1] % mod`.**
