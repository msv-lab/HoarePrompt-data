The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are positive integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, which remains unchanged since `y` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept two positive integers `x` and `y`, and return their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers x and y, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).**
