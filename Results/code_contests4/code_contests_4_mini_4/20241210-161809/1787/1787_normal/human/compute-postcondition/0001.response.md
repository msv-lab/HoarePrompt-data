The values of `x` and `y` are swapped, with `x` being assigned the value of `y` and `y` being assigned the value of `x % y`. Since both `x` and `y` are positive integers, the value of `y` will be the remainder of `x` divided by `y`, which is guaranteed to be less than `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` becomes `y`, and `y` becomes `x % y`, where `x` and `y` are positive integers.

Output State: **`x` is now equal to `y`, `y` is now equal to `x % y`, where both `x` and `y` are positive integers.**
