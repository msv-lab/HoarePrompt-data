The code updates the `ifact` list at index `i - 1`, which is `100003`, by assigning it the value of `i * ifact[i] % mod`. Given that `i` is `100004`, the value of `ifact[100004]` has already been calculated as `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`. 

Therefore, `ifact[i - 1]`, which is `ifact[100003]`, will now be calculated as follows:

- `i` is `100004`
- `ifact[i]` is `ifact[100004]`, which is `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`

So, `ifact[100003]` will be assigned the value of:
```
100004 * ifact[100004] % mod
```
This means `ifact[100003]` will hold the result of this calculation.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`mod` is a positive integer, `fact` is a list containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo `mod`, `i` is 100004, `ifact` is a list of length 100005 with `ifact[100004]` equal to `pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)`, `ifact[100003]` is equal to `100004 * ifact[100004] % mod`.**
