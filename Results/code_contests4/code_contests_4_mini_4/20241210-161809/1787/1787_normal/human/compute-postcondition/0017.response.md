Output State: **The program returns the list 'fact' containing the first 100005 factorial values modulo 'mod', and the list 'ifact' where 'ifact[0]' is equal to 1, 'ifact[1]' is equal to 1, 'ifact[2]' is equal to 2 * ifact[1] % mod, ..., and 'ifact[100004]' is equal to pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod), with each 'ifact[k]' for k from 0 to 100004 computed as k * ifact[k + 1] % mod.**
