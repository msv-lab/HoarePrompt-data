Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). If `y` is initially 0, the function directly returns `x`, which remains unchanged, effectively returning `x` as the GCD. The function handles cases where `y` is positive, as the loop continues until `y` becomes 0, ensuring the correct GCD is calculated regardless of the initial values.**
