The code `x, y = y, x % y` performs a simultaneous assignment where `x` is assigned the current value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the value of `x % y`. 

Given the initial state:
- `x` is now equal to `y`
- `y` is now equal to `x % y`
- `x` must not be a multiple of the current value of `y`

From the initial state, we know the following:
1. After the assignment, `x` takes the value of `y`.
2. `y` takes the value of `x % y`, which is determined by the current values of `x` and `y`.

Since `x` is not a multiple of `y`, it indicates that the modulo operation will yield a non-zero remainder, and thus `y` will be a value less than the original `y`.

Therefore, we update the output state:
- `x` is now equal to the previous value of `y`
- `y` is now equal to the result of `x % y` which is less than the previous value of `y`

Output State: **`x` is equal to the previous value of `y`, `y` is equal to `x % y` which is less than the previous value of `y`, and `x` is not a multiple of the current value of `y`.**
