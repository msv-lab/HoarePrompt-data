You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!

A password is an array a of n positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index i such that 1 ≤ i < n and a_{i} ≠ a_{i+1}, delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array and put a_{i}+a_{i+1} in their place. 

For example, for array [7, 4, 3, 7] you can choose i = 2 and the array will become [7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.

Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 1. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 0) of operations?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the password.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the initial contents of your password.

The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

Example

Input


2
4
2 1 3 1
2
420 420


Output


1
2

Note

In the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of 1:

Pick i=2 to get [2, 4, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [6, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [7]

In the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid i that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
