To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we must analyze the logic used in the program and how it addresses the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: Two integers `a` and `b`, representing the frequency of trains going to Dasha and Masha, respectively.
2. **Output**: The program should output "Dasha" if trains to Dasha come more frequently, "Masha" if trains to Masha come more frequently, and "Equal" if they come with the same frequency.

### Analysis of the Program
```python
(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
g = a * b / func_1(a, b)
if g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1:
    print('Equal')
elif a < b:
    print('Dasha')
else:
    print('Masha')

def func_1(a, b):
    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)
```

1. The program uses `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. This is a correct implementation of the Euclidean algorithm.
2. The variable `g` is calculated as `a * b / func_1(a, b)`, which gives the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
3. The condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` is intended to check if the frequencies lead to equal wait times for both girlfriends.

### Issues Identified
1. The condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` is problematic:
   - This condition relies on specific numeric relationships between `a` and `b`. However, it does not accurately reflect the requirement that Vasya goes to each girlfriend based on the frequency of train arrivals. The relationship defined by this condition does not hold for all cases and can produce incorrect results.
   - For instance, if `a = 4` and `b = 6`, the LCM is `12`, and the calculated waits would show that he does not go equally often to Dasha and Masha, contradicting the logic used in the program.

2. The program implicitly assumes that if `a < b`, Vasya goes to Dasha, and if `a > b`, he goes to Masha. This does not account for the frequency ties or the exact times he would leave for each girlfriend based on the train schedule.

### Example Case Where It Fails
Consider the input:
- `a = 4`, `b = 6`
This gives:
- LCM = 12
- Minutes going to Dasha: [0, 4, 8] (3 minutes)
- Minutes going to Masha: [0, 6, 12] (3 minutes)
Thus, the output should be "Equal", but the program may not handle this correctly due to the flawed conditions.

### Conclusion
Given these issues with the logic, particularly the incorrect handling of the case comparisons based on the train schedules, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
