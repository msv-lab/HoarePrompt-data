To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it correctly implements the requirements specified.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Vasya's Choices**: Vasya goes to Dasha or Masha based on the frequency of the trains.
2. **Train Frequencies**: Trains to Dasha come every `a` minutes, and trains to Masha come every `b` minutes.
3. **Train Arrivals**: We need to determine how often Vasya will go to each girlfriend based on the timing of train arrivals.

### Expected Outcomes:

- If the frequency is lower for Dasha, he will go there more often and vice versa.
- If the frequencies result in equal opportunities to catch a train to either girlfriend, the output should be "Equal".

### Program Analysis:

1. The program begins by reading two integers `a` and `b`.
2. It calculates `g = a * b / func_1(a, b)`, where `func_1(a, b)` is defined as finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. This part is incorrect because it does not directly assess the frequencies of train arrivals but rather calculates a value based on their GCD.
3. The condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` is used to determine if Vasya goes to both girlfriends equally. This condition does not logically follow from the train scheduling problem as described; it does not accurately assess how often he goes to each girlfriend based on the arrival times of the trains.
4. The checks for `a < b` and `a > b` directly lead to outputs based on the train frequencies, but the previous logic does not correctly determine how many times Vasya visits each girlfriend.

### Conclusion:

The program does not implement the logic required to determine how often Vasya visits each girlfriend. The incorrect usage of GCD and the conditions used to compare frequencies do not adhere to the problem requirements.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and fails to correctly determine the frequency of visits based on train arrivals.
