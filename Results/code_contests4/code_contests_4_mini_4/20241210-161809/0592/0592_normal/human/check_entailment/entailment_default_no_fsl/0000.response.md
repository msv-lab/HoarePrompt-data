Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly determine which girlfriend Vasya will go to more frequently based on the input values of `a` and `b`. 

The output logic relies on the condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1`, where `g` is calculated as `a * b / func_1(a, b)`. This condition does not accurately reflect the frequency of train arrivals or the decision-making process that Vasya follows. 

For example, let's consider the input values `a = 3` and `b = 7`:
- According to the problem statement, since `3 < 7`, Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently. 
- However, if we follow the logic in the code, the calculation of `g` (which depends on the GCD of `a` and `b`) and the subsequent checks may not yield the expected output.

Moreover, the program does not account for the condition where Vasya might have to choose between two trains arriving at the same time. The decision-making rule outlined in the problem states that if two trains arrive simultaneously, Vasya goes to the direction with the lower frequency, which is not accounted for in the provided logic.

Therefore, because of these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to an overall determination of correctness as **False**.
