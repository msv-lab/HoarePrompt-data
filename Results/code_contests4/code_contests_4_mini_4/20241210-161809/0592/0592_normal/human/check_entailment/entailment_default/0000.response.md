The provided program aims to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently based on the arrival times of the trains. The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to calculate the moments of the trains' arrival and then attempts to derive whether Vasya will go to Dasha or Masha more often.

However, upon analyzing the code and the output hints, there are several issues:

1. The calculation of `g` using `a * b / func_1(a, b)` is meant to determine the period of the train arrivals. However, it does not directly follow the logic required to compare the time intervals correctly. The relationship derived from `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` is not a robust or correct way to determine the frequency of visits.

2. The check for equality (`g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1`) does not accurately capture the condition of Vasya visiting his girlfriends equally. The logic does not consider how many times he would actually wait for each train during their respective intervals, leading to potential inaccuracies in the output.

3. The output hints explain that the function computes the GCD, which is not directly necessary to determine the frequency of visits. Instead, the solution should have focused on the intervals directly (i.e., how many times Vasya would go to each girlfriend based on the respective intervals).

To illustrate a case where the program does not work correctly, consider the input values:
- Input: `6 8`
- Expected Output: `Masha`
- Actual Output: The program may not handle this correctly because the checks do not properly quantify the frequency of visits based on the interval logic.

Given these observations, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
