To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the program logic.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Vasya has two girlfriends, Dasha and Masha, who live at different ends of the subway branch.
2. Trains to Dasha arrive every `a` minutes, and trains to Masha arrive every `b` minutes.
3. If both trains arrive at the same time, Vasya chooses the direction with the lower frequency (i.e., the girlfriend whose train arrives less frequently).
4. The output must indicate whether Vasya goes to Dasha more often, Masha more often, or equally often.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program takes two integers `a` and `b` from input, representing the frequencies of the trains.
2. It uses a function `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
3. The variable `g` is calculated as `a * b / func_1(a, b)`, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
4. The program checks if `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1`, which aims to determine if the frequencies lead to an equal distribution of trips to both girlfriends over the LCM period.
5. Depending on the result of the check, it prints "Equal", "Dasha", or "Masha".

### Issues with the Program:
1. The condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` does not accurately determine if Vasya goes to both girlfriends equally often. The correct approach would be to compare the counts of how many times he goes to each girlfriend during the LCM period.
2. If we analyze the moments Vasya would choose each girlfriend, the program does not account for the case when he must choose between the two trains arriving simultaneously. The logic needs to explicitly count the number of arrivals for each girlfriend within the LCM period.

### Conclusion:
The condition used in the program does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements, specifically regarding how to determine whether he visits Dasha, Masha, or both equally often based on their train frequencies. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
