Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that lead to incorrect results. Here are the reasons why the program does not satisfy the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of g**: The line `g = a * b / func_1(a, b)` is meant to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, but it incorrectly uses integer division (`/`) instead of floating-point division. This could lead to incorrect results due to truncation of any decimal values.

2. **Logic for "Equal" Output**: The condition `if g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1:` is incorrect. The logic should determine whether Vasya goes to Dasha or Masha more frequently based on the intervals of time he would arrive at each girlfriend's station. The current condition does not properly evaluate the scenario where he could go to each girlfriend the same number of times within the calculated period.

3. **Function Implementation**: The `func_1` is intended to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, but it is not used correctly in the context of calculating the frequency of visits to each girlfriend. Instead, the GCD should be used to derive the LCM properly for the calculations.

4. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not account for edge cases correctly, such as when `a` and `b` are very close to each other, which could lead to Vasya favoring one girlfriend over another based on incorrect calculations.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the inputs `a = 2` and `b = 3`. The expected output should be "Equal" as both girlfriends get equal time. However, due to the flawed logic and division operations, the program might not correctly determine this scenario.

Given these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
