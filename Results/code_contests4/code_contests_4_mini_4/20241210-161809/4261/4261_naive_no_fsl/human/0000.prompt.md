You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Suppose you are performing the following algorithm. There is an array v_1, v_2, ..., v_n filled with zeroes at start. The following operation is applied to the array several times — at i-th step (0-indexed) you can: 

  * either choose position pos (1 ≤ pos ≤ n) and increase v_{pos} by k^i; 
  * or not choose any position and skip this step. 



You can choose how the algorithm would behave on each step and when to stop it. The question is: can you make array v equal to the given array a (v_j = a_j for each j) after some step?

Input

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 2T lines contain test cases — two lines per test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the size of arrays v and a and value k used in the algorithm.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{16}) — the array you'd like to achieve.

Output

For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if you can achieve the array a after some step or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.

Example

Input


5
4 100
0 0 0 0
1 2
1
3 4
1 4 1
3 2
0 1 3
3 9
0 59049 810


Output


YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, you can stop the algorithm before the 0-th step, or don't choose any position several times and stop the algorithm.

In the second test case, you can add k^0 to v_1 and stop the algorithm.

In the third test case, you can't make two 1 in the array v.

In the fifth test case, you can skip 9^0 and 9^1, then add 9^2 and 9^3 to v_3, skip 9^4 and finally, add 9^5 to v_2.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
