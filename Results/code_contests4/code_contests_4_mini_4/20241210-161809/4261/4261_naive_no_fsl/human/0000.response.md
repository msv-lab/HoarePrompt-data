The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to reach a target array `a` from an initial array of zeroes by incrementing specific positions with powers of `k`. 

To verify the correctness of the program, let's analyze the core logic in the `func_1` function:

1. The program reads the size of the array and the value of `k`.
2. It then iterates over each element in the target array `li`.
3. For each element, it tries to determine how many times it can be divided by increasing powers of `k` (i.e., checks how many times `k^j` can be subtracted from `i`).
4. It keeps track of the required powers of `k` using a set named `req`, which ensures that no two positions are assigned the same power of `k`.

### Potential Issues:

- The logic for determining the powers and ensuring uniqueness seems flawed. For instance, if `k` is 2 and the target array `a` contains `3`, the program will attempt to derive this using powers of `2`, which cannot yield a result of `3` (since `3` cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of `2`).
- The program does not seem to account for the possibility of needing the same power multiple times across different elements of the array. For example, if the target array is `[1, 1]`, the program will incorrectly conclude that it cannot achieve this, as both `1`s require the same power of `k^0`.

### Example Case:

Consider the target array `a = [1, 1]` with `k = 2`:
- The correct output should be "YES" since we can achieve both `1`s by using `2^0` twice, but the program will track `0` in the set and conclude that it cannot assign the same power to two different positions.

This indicates that the program does not handle cases where multiple elements in the array require the same power of `k`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issue identified, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **False**
