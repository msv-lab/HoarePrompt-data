The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. Since `j` is not an element of `req` prior to this operation, it will now be included in `req`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `r` remain unchanged, and all other conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + r`; `j` is the previous value of `j + r`; `j` is now an element of `req`.**
