To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` must be either 1 or -1.
2. Calculate `k ** (j + 1)`: Since `j` is 2, `j + 1` equals 3. Therefore, we have two cases for `k`:
   - If `k` is 1: `k ** (j + 1)` = 1 ** 3 = 1
   - If `k` is -1: `k ** (j + 1)` = (-1) ** 3 = -1

3. For the loop condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` to hold true:
   - If `k` is 1: The condition becomes `1 % 1 == 0`, which is true, so the loop can execute one more time. No adjustments are needed.
   - If `k` is -1: The condition becomes `1 % -1 == 0`, which is technically true in Python since the modulus operator returns the remainder, which is 0 when the divisor is -1. So the loop can also execute one more time in this case as well.

Since in both cases the loop can execute one more time with the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1**
