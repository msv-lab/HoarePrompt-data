The operation `j += r` updates the value of `j` by adding the value of `r` to it. Since `r` is initialized to 0 in the initial state, the value of `j` remains unchanged after this operation. The other variables `i` and `r` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is a multiple of `k^j` divided by `k^j`, `r` is 0, and `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is a multiple of `k^j` divided by `k^j`, `r` is 0, and `j` remains unchanged.**
