The variable `r` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, the value of `r` will now be equal to `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is a positive multiple of `k`, `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to `j` including `j`, `r` is equal to `j`, `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
