To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is currently 0, which means `j + 1` is 1.
   - The expression `k ** (j + 1)` simplifies to `k ** 1`, which is just `k`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `i % k == 0`. This means `i` must be divisible by `k`.

2. **State of Variables:**
   - Since `i` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute, `i` must be divisible by `k`. Currently, we do not have information about `k`, thus we need to ensure that `i` is indeed divisible by `k`.

3. **Adjustment Requirement:**
   - If `i` is not currently divisible by `k`, then we need to adjust `i` to be a multiple of `k`. One straightforward way to ensure this is to set `i` to the next highest multiple of `k`, which would require `i` to be adjusted to `i + (k - (i % k))` if it is not already divisible.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `j`, `req`, `r`, and `li` do not seem to require modification based on the loop condition, but `j` is equal to 0, which is valid as per the loop condition, and `req` should remain unchanged as it contains all unique values up to `j`.

In conclusion, the adjustment needed is primarily focused on ensuring that `i` is a multiple of `k`. Without specific information about `k`, we must include that `i` must be adjusted accordingly to ensure divisibility.

State: **`i` must be adjusted to be a multiple of `k`, `j` is 0, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to the new `j` including the new `j`, `r` is equal to the new `j`, `li` contains at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
