The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after the operation, `j` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of `req` now contains the new value of `j`. 

Output State: **`i` is at least `2*k`, `j` is 1, `j` is not an element of `req` now, `req` now contains 1, and `r` is equal to 0**.
