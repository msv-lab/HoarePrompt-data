The value of `i` is updated by performing an integer floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `i` is 1, `k` can be either 1 or -1, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, we can analyze the outcomes:

1. If `k` is 1, the expression `k ** j` equals 1, hence `i //= 1`, which means `i` remains 1.
2. If `k` is -1, the expression `k ** j` would alternate between -1 and 1 depending on whether `j` is even or odd:
   - If `j` is odd, `k ** j` is -1, thus `i //= -1`, which results in `i` becoming -1.
   - If `j` is even, `k ** j` is 1, thus `i //= 1`, which means `i` remains 1.

Since `j` is defined as greater than or equal to 1, both scenarios for `k` and `j` need to be considered.

Thus, the output state reflects all possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`i` is either 1 or -1; `j` is greater than or equal to 1; `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations; `r` is 0; `k` must be 1 or -1.**
