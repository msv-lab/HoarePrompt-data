The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 1, so after the increment, `j` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1.**
