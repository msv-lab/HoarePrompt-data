The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after the execution, `j` will now be 1. The other variables `i` and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, `j` is now 1, `r` is equal to `req`.

Output State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, `j` is now 1, `r` is equal to `req`**
