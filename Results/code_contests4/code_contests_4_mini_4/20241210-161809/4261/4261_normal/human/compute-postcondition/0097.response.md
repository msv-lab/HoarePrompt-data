The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + r`, and `r` is equal to `j`, the value of `j + r` remains unchanged. The new value of `i` will still be a positive integer, and it will still be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + r`, but now it is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + r`, `j` is the previous value of `j + r`, `r` is equal to `j`, and `i` is decreased by 1.**
