The variable `r` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables `i`, `j`, `req`, and `li` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `r` is now `0`, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is the next value in `li`, `j` is the last computed value based on the current iteration, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `li` must contain at least one more element than before.**
