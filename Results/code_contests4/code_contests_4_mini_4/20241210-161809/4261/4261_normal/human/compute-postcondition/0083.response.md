The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 0, so after the increment, `j` becomes 1. The variable `i` remains unchanged, but it must still adhere to the condition of being greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`. 

Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`; `j` is 1**
