To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `i > 0`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. 

Currently, the state indicates that `i` is the next value in `li`. For the loop to execute at least once, `li` must contain values such that `i` will be greater than 0. Since `li` must contain at least one more element than before, we need to ensure that `li` has a positive value that can be assigned to `i`.

Thus, we should adjust the state to ensure that `li` contains a value greater than 0 to satisfy the condition `i > 0`. 

State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `j` is the last computed value based on the current iteration, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
