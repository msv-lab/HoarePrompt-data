The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially 1, it will now be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected, but since `req` contains all unique values of `j`, it will now contain the value 2 as well, assuming it previously contained only the value 1. 

The output state reflects the updated value of `j` and the potential update to `req`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` must be a positive multiple of `k^2`, `j` is 2, `req` contains all unique values including 1 and 2, `r` is 0, `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.

Output State: **`i` must be a positive multiple of `k^2`, `j` is 2, `req` contains all unique values including 1 and 2, `r` is 0, `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
