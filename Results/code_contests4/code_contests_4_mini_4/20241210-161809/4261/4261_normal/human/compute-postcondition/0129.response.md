The variable `j` is incremented by the value of `r`. The previous value of `r` is 0, meaning `j` remains unchanged after this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a positive multiple of `k`, `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to `j`, `r` is 0, `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0, and `i` is still reduced to `i // k`.
