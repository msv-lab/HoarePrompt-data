According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The loop condition states that `i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` must be greater than 0 and is currently a multiple of `k` (since it is specified as a multiple of `k` for `j`). After the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still satisfy the condition of being a multiple of `k` raised to the new power, which is `j + 1` (the incremented value of `j`). This means that `i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, which it currently is not guaranteed to be, as `j` has just increased.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0, a multiple of `k`; `j` is increased by 1, and `i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`**
