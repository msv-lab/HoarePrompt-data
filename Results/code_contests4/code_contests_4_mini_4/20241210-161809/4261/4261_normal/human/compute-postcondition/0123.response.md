According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be a positive multiple of `k`, and `j` is 1. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of 2 (since `j + 1` equals 2).

Currently, we know:

- `i` is a positive multiple of `k`, but we do not know if it is a multiple of `k^2`.
- `j` is 1, meaning we need `i` to be divisible by `k^2` for the loop to proceed.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be a positive multiple of `k^2`. No other states need to be adjusted, as the other conditions regarding `req`, `r`, and `li` do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`i` must be a positive multiple of `k^2`, `j` is 1, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0**
