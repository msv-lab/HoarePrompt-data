The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is a positive multiple of `k`, after decrementing, `i` will still be a positive integer, but it may not remain a multiple of `k`. The value of `j`, which is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, could potentially change depending on the new value of `i`. 

Since `j` depends on `i`, if `i` is no longer a multiple of `k^j` after decrementing, `j` will decrease accordingly. The variable `req`, which contains unique values from 1 to `j`, will also be affected if `j` changes. However, `r` will be updated to reflect the new value of `j`.

The variable `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0, so it remains unchanged in terms of its conditions being satisfied. 

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `j` is the highest integer such that the new `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to the new `j` including the new `j`, `r` is equal to the new `j`, `li` contains at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
