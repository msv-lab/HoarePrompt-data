The variable `j` is added to the set `req`. As `j` is not an element of `req`, after executing the code, `req` will now contain all unique values from 1 to `j` plus the value of `j` itself. The values of `i`, `r`, and the list `li` remain unchanged based on the provided initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been added to `req`.

Output State: **`i` is a positive multiple of `k`, `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to `j` including `j`, `r` is 0, `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
