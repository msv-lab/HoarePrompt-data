The function `func_2('NO')` is called, but since we don't have the implementation details of `func_2`, we cannot determine its effect on the variables `j`, `i`, `r`, or any other variables. However, we know that `j` remains unchanged, and since the initial state specifies the current value of `j` is in `req`, we can conclude that `j` still holds its value in `req` after the function call. 

The other variables `i` and `r` are not affected by the function call based on the information given. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` remains in the state specified by `req`.

Output State: **`j` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is a multiple of `k^j` divided by `k^j`, `r` is 0, `j` remains unchanged, and the current value of `j` is in `req`.**
