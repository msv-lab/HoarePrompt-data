According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The loop can execute again if `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` must be greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`, and `j` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i % k ** (j + 1)` is still 0. Since `j` is currently 1, `j + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `i` must be a multiple of `k ** 2`. 

Since `i` is already a multiple of `k`, we need to adjust the condition to ensure that `i` is a multiple of `k ** 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be a multiple of `k ** 2`, `j` is 1**
