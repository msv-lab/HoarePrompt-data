According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop will execute again if `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, and `j` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must remain a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

Since `j` has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still a multiple of `k` raised to the new value of `j + 1` (which is now one more than before). Therefore, the condition must be adjusted to ensure that `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to this new value.

State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, and `i` must also be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`**
