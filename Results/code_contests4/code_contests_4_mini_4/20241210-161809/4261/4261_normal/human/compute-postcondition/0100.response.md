According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

Right before the loop, `i` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. Given that `j` is currently 0, this means we need to check if `i % k == 0`. 

Since `i` must be greater than 0, we can conclude that for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must also be a multiple of `k`. Therefore, we need to specify that `i` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be a multiple of `k`.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be a multiple of `k`, `j` is 0**
