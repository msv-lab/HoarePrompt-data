The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 2, so the new value of `j` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is now 3, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, `k` must be 1 or -1**.
