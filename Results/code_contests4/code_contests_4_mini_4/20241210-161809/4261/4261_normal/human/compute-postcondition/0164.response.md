The value of `i` is assigned the result of `i //= k ** j`. Since `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, this operation will result in `i` being divided by `k^j`, effectively reducing its value. The values of `j` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is a multiple of `k^j` divided by `k^j`, and `r` is 0.

Output State: **`j` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is a multiple of `k^j` divided by `k^j`, `r` is 0**.
