According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop condition states that `i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is now 1, which means we need to check if `i` is a multiple of `k ** 2` (since `j + 1` equals 2). 

Currently, `i` must be adjusted to ensure that it is a multiple of `k ** 2`. Therefore, the state of `i` must reflect that `i` is a multiple of `k ** 2`.

Additionally, there are no changes needed for the other variables (`j`, `req`, `r`, `li`) since they are already in a suitable state according to the requirements provided.

State: **`i` must be adjusted to be a multiple of `k ** 2`, `j` is now 1, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to the new `j` including the new `j`, `r` is equal to the new `j`, `li` contains at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
