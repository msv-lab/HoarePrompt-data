The function `func_2('NO')` is called, which likely changes the state based on its internal logic or effects. However, the specific outcome of this function call is not provided in the context. 

The initial state indicates that:
- `i` is adjusted to `i // k`
- `j` is increased by `r`
- The current value of `j` is an element in `req`

Since no specific changes to `i`, `j`, or `req` are given in the function call, we cannot determine the new values of these variables or their relationships after executing `func_2('NO')`.

Therefore, the output state remains with the values of `i`, `j`, and the relationship to `req` as they were before the function call.

Output State: **`i` is adjusted to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, and the current value of `j` is an element in `req`.**
