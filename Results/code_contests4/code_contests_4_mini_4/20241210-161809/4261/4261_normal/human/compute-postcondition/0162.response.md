The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 2 to 3. The values of `i`, `r`, and the conditions related to `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` must be a multiple of `k^2`, `j` is now 3, `r` is now 0, and `i` must be a multiple of `k^3`.

Output State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k^2`, `j` is now 3, `r` is now 0, and `i` must be a multiple of `k^3**.
