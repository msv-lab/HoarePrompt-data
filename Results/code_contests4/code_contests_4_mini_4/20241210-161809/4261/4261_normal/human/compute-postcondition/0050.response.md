The statement `i //= k ** j` updates the value of `i` by performing an integer division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. As `j` is now an element of `req`, it implies that its value can vary based on the contents of `req`. The value of `k` is not defined in the initial state, but it remains the same. The variable `r` is not affected by this operation. 

Thus, after executing the code, `i` will take the new value of `i // (k ** j)`, where `j` is the maximum number of times `i` is divisible by `k` and is now an element of `req`. 

Output State: **`i` is adjusted to `i // (k ** j)`, `j` is now an element of `req`, `r` is equal to 0.**
