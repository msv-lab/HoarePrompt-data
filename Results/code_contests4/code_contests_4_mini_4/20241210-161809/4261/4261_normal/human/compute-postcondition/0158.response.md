The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `j` was 0, so after the operation, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`i` and `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` must be a multiple of `k`, `j` is now 1, `r` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k`, `j` is now 1, `r` is now 0**
