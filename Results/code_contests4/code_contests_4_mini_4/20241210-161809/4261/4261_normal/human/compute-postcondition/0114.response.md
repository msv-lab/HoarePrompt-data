Given the initial state and the provided code, let's analyze the changes:

- `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k`, and `j` is currently in `req`.
- The variable `r` now takes on the same value as `j`, but no other variables are affected by this assignment.

Since `i`, `k`, and `req` remain unchanged, the final state will reflect the updated value of `r`.

Output State: **`j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k`; `i` is updated to `i // k`; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is now in `req`; `r` is equal to `j`.**
