The variable `i` is assigned the value of `i //= k ** j`, which indicates that `i` is now reduced by dividing it by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `i` is a positive multiple of `k^j`, this operation will yield a positive integer value for `i` that is also a multiple of `k` but reduced by the factor of `k^j`. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not modified by this code. The other variables `req`, `r`, and `li` are unaffected by this operation. 

Since `i` was originally a positive multiple of `k^j`, after performing the operation `i //= k ** j`, `i` will now be a positive integer that is less than its previous value. 

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is a positive multiple of `k`, `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to `j`, `r` is 0, `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0, and `i` is now reduced to `i // (k ** j)`.**
