To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition within the `while` loop: `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `i` is at least `k + 1`: This means `i` is sufficiently large compared to `k`, but we need to ensure that `i` is divisible by `k ** (j + 1)`.
   - `j` is now 0: This means we are checking divisibility by `k ** 1`, which is simply `k`.
   - `r` is now 0: This variable does not directly affect the loop condition, so we can ignore it for this analysis.

2. **Analyzing the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i % k == 0` must be true. This means that `i` must be divisible by `k`.
   - Since `i` is at least `k + 1`, it doesn't guarantee that `i` is divisible by `k`. For instance, if `k` is 2, then `i` could be 3, which is not divisible by 2.

3. **Required Adjustment**:
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted such that it is a multiple of `k`. This can be accomplished by setting `i` to the next highest multiple of `k` that is at least `k + 1`. 

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The state needs to ensure that `i` is adjusted to be a multiple of `k`. 

State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k`, `j` is now 0, `r` is now 0**
