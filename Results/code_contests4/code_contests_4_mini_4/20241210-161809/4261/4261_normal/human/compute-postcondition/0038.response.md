The code `req.add(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the set `req`. Since `j` was defined as equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`, and `j` is not already an element of `req`, this operation will include `j` in `req`.

The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but `req` will now contain the value of `j`. 

Output State: **`i` is equal to `i // (k)`; `j` is equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`, `j` is not an element of `req`, and `req` now contains `j`.**
