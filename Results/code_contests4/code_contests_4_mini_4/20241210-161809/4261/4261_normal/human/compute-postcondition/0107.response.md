The variable `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `j` is defined as the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k`, the result of `i //= k ** j` will be `i` divided by `k` to the power of `j`, effectively removing all factors of `k` from `i`. The value of `j` remains unchanged. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k`; `i` is updated to `i // (k ** j)`**.
