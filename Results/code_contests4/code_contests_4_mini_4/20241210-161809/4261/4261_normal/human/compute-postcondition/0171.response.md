The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` remains unchanged, and `r` now takes on that value. The variable `r` updates to the current value of `j`, while the other variables retain their previous states. Additionally, `j` is now included in the set `req`.

Output State: **`j` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is a multiple of `k^j` divided by `k^j`, `r` is equal to `j`, `j` remains unchanged, `j` is not an element of `req`, and `req` now includes `j`.**
