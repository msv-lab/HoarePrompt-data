According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which is already greater than 0, so the loop can execute immediately. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is the first element of `li`, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0**
