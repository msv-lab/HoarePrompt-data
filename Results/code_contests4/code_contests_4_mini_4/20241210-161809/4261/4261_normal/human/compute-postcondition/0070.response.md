The loop continues to execute as long as `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. Given that `i` starts at 1, for the loop to execute, the expression `k ** (j + 1)` must be a divisor of 1. 

Since `i` is 1, it can only be divisible by 1 or -1. In both cases, the loop will execute as long as `j` increases, starting from `j = 0`.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1. 

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1.

The loop will terminate when `k ** (j + 1)` is no longer a divisor of 1. Since `k` must be either 1 or -1, the loop will continue executing indefinitely until an external constraint stops it or if `k` changes. However, under the assumption that `k` stays constant throughout the iterations, the loop will keep incrementing `j`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have executed, since `j` continues to increase indefinitely, we can summarize:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1.**
