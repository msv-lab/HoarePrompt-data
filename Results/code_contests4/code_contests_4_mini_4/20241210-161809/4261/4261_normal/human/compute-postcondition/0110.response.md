The function `func_2` is called with the argument `'NO'`. However, without knowing the implications of this function on the state of the variables or any changes it might cause, I can only note that the existing states of other variables remain valid. The values of `i`, `k`, `r`, and `req` are unchanged, and the initial state of `j` is preserved.

Output State: **`j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k`, `i` has been updated to `i // k`, `j` has been increased by `r`, and `j` is an element of `req`; function `func_2` has been called with the argument 'NO'.**
