According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop condition checks if `i` is divisible by \( k^{(j + 1)} \). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, `j` is now 1, and `r` is equal to `req`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` is a multiple of \( k^{(j + 1)} \), which means it should be a multiple of \( k^2 \) since \( j \) is currently 1. 

Given that `i` is a multiple of `k`, it will be a multiple of \( k^2 \) if \( i \) is at least \( k^2 \). Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is a multiple of \( k^2 \).

State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, and `i` must be adjusted to be a multiple of `k^2`**
