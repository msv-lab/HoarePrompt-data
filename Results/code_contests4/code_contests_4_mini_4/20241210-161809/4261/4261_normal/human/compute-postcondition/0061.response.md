The variable `r` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `r` was equal to the first value of `j`, which was not specified but is now replaced by `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is the first element of `li`, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, and `r` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is the first element of `li`, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0**.
