According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `(i // (k)) - 1`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` to ensure it remains positive. The current expression for `i`, `(i // (k)) - 1`, must be greater than 0.

This implies that:
1. `(i // (k))` must be greater than or equal to 2, which means `i` must be at least `2*k` in the previous state to ensure that `(i // (k)) - 1` results in a positive value.

No other states need to be adjusted based on the provided information.

State: **`i` must be at least `2*k`, `j` is equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`, `j` is not an element of `req`, `req` now contains `j`, and `r` is equal to `j`**
