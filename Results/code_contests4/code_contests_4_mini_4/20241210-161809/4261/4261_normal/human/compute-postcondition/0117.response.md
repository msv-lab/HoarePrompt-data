According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `li`. The loop iterates over the elements in `li`, and the variable `i` takes the values of those elements. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1. Since the loop must execute at least as many times as the original value of `i`, it implies that the original list `li` must contain at least one element that is greater than or equal to -1 for the loop to execute again. 

In the next iteration, `i` will take the next value from `li`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `li` must contain at least one more element, and `i` must be updated to this new value. 

State: **`i` is the next value in `li`, `j` is the last computed value based on the current iteration, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is equal to the last computed value of `j`, and `li` must contain at least one more element than before**.
