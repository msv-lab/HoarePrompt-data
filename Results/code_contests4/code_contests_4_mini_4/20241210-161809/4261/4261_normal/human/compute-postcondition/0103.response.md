The variable `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is not directly affected by this operation, and the constraints on `i` (being greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`) remain valid. The state of the other variables is not impacted. 

Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be a multiple of `k`; `j` is increased by 1.**
