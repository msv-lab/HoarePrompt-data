The value of `j` is assigned to 0, which indicates that `j` is now 0. The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects the unchanged conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to the new `j` including the new `j`, `r` is equal to the new `j`, `li` contains at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
