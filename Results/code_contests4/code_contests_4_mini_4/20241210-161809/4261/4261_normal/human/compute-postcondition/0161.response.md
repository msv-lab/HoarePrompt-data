To determine the conditions under which the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`.

1. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is a multiple of `k ** (j + 1)`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` must be a multiple of `k^2` (since `j` is now 2, `j + 1` is 3, so we are checking `k^3`).
3. Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must also be a multiple of `k^3` at this state.

Given this, we need to ensure that `i` is not only a multiple of `k^2` but also satisfies the condition for `k^3`. We know `j` is now 2, so we do not need to make any adjustments for `j`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` must also be a multiple of `k^3`.

State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k^2`, `j` is now 2, `r` is now 0, and `i` must be a multiple of `k^3`**
