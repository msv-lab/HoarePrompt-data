The variable `j` is incremented by the value of `r`. The value of `i` remains unchanged in this operation, and there are no other variables affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `i // (k)`; `j` is now equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `i // (k)`; `j` is now equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`.**
