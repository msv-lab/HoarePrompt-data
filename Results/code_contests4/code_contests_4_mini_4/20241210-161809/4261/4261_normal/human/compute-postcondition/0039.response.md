The variable `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` is equal to its previous value plus `r`, and `j` is not an element of `req`, and `req` now contains `j`. Since `r` is assigned the value of `j`, the output state reflects that `r` takes on the value of `j`. However, we do not have the specific previous value of `j` to mention. 

Therefore, the output state remains valid for the unchanged variables while updating `r` to be equal to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `i // (k)`; `j` is equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`, `j` is not an element of `req`, `req` now contains `j`, and `r` is equal to `j`.**
