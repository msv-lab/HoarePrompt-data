The variable `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by `r` and is now in `req`, but the specific values of `i`, `k`, `j`, and `req` are not provided. Since `r` takes on the value of `j`, the updated value of `r` will be equal to whatever value `j` had after it was increased. The other variables remain unchanged in their conditions.

Output State: **`i` is reduced to `i // k`, `j` is now in `req`, `r` is equal to `j`.**
