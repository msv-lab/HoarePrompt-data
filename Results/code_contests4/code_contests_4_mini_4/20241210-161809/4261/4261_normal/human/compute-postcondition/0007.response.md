The value of `x` is written to the file as a string. The variable `at_start` is False, which indicates that the file previously had a value written with a separator. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing at least 1 value, `x` is the first value in `args`, `at_start` is False, and the value of `x` has been written to the file as a string.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing at least 1 value, `x` is the first value in `args`, `at_start` is False, and the value of `x` has been written to the file as a string.**
