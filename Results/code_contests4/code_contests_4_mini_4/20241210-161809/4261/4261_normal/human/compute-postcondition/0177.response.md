Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `li` of `n` non-negative integers. It processes each element in `li` to compute a set of unique values derived from their divisibility by powers of `k`. If any computed value already exists in the set, it calls `func_2` with 'NO' and exits; otherwise, after processing all elements, it calls `func_2` with 'YES'. The function does not return any value. **
