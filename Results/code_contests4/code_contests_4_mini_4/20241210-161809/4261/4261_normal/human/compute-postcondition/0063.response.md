The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `j` was the first element of `li`, but after this assignment, `j` is now specifically `0`. The values of `i`, `req`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0**.
