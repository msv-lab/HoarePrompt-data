The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` must be a multiple of `k^2`, `j` is now 2, `r` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k^2`, `j` is now 2, `r` is now 0**
