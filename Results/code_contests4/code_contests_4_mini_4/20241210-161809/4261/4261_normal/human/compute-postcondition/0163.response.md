To determine the output state after the loop executes, we analyze the conditions and results derived from the loop code. 

Initially, we have:
- `i` is at least `k + 1`
- `j` is now 0
- `r` is now 0

Now, let's summarize the output states after each iteration provided in the task:

1. **Output State after loop executes 1 time**: 
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be a multiple of `k`. 
   - After execution, `j` is now 1, and `r` remains 0. 

2. **Output State after loop executes 2 times**: 
   - For the loop to execute twice, `i` must be a multiple of `k^2`. 
   - After execution, `j` is now 2, and `r` remains 0.

3. **Output State after loop executes 3 times**: 
   - For the loop to execute three times, `i` must be a multiple of `k^3`. 
   - After execution, `j` is now 3, and `r` remains 0.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that after all iterations of the loop have executed (where `j` has increased to its final value based on how many times the loop executed), the final output state will depend on how many times the loop was able to execute based on the original value of `i`:

- If the loop executed `n` times, then `j` will be `n`, and `i` must have been a multiple of `k^(n)`.
- After the loop finishes executing, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is the count of how many times the loop executed, and `r` remains 0.

Thus, the overall output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`j` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, `r` is 0**
