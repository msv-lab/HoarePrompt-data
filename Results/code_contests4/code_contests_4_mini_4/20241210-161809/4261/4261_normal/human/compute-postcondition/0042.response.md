The value of `j` is directly assigned to `0`. The previous state indicates that `j` was equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`. Now, since `j` is set to `0`, it indicates that the previous value of `j` plus `r` must have been `0`. Therefore, `r` must also be `0` to satisfy this condition if `j` was previously greater than `0`. 

No other variables are affected, but we know from the initial state that `j` is now `0`, and it will still not be an element of `req`, as `req` was previously defined. 

Output State: **`i` must be at least `2*k`, `j` is 0, `j` is not an element of `req`, `req` now contains `j`, and `r` is equal to 0.**
