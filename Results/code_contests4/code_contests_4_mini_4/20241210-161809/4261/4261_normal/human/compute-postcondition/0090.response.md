The value of `j` is incremented by `r`. The value of `i` is reduced to `i // (k ** j)`, which means `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of the new value of `j`. The initial condition states that `i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, so after this operation, `i` will still be a positive integer, and it will now be a multiple of `k` raised to the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + r`; `j` is the previous value of `j + r`.**
