According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a positive integer, which means it is already greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `i` to allow the loop to execute one more time. 

Since the loop condition is satisfied and there are no other dependencies that need changing, all other states can remain unchanged. 

State: **`i` is a positive integer, `j` is the highest integer such that the new `i` is a multiple of `k^j`, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to the new `j` including the new `j`, `r` is equal to the new `j`, `li` contains at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
