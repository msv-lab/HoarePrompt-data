According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `li`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which indicates that this is the first iteration of the loop. Since the loop is structured to iterate over each element in `li`, and `i` represents the current element being processed, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to advance to the next element in `li`. 

If the original value of `i` was 0, the loop has not yet processed any elements. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be the first element in `li`. 

Assuming `li` contains at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1, and `j` should be set to the value of the element at index 1 of `li`. 

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now 1 and `j` is the next element in `li`.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is the first element of `li`, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is equal to the first value of `j`**
