The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is increased by `r` in the initial state, we know that the new value of `j` is now the previous value of `j` plus `r`. However, `r` is now equal to `j`, which means that `j` becomes double its original value after the assignment. The initial conditions regarding `i` remain unchanged, as `i` was adjusted before this code execution. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is adjusted to `i // k`, `j` is now double its previous value, and `j` is an element of `req`.

Output State: **`i` is adjusted to `i // k`, `j` is now double its previous value, `j` is an element of `req`.**
