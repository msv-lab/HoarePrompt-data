According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `(j + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be a multiple of `k`, `j` is now 1, and `r` is now 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is still divisible by `k` raised to the power of 2 (since `j + 1` is now 2). Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to ensure it is a multiple of `k^2`. 

State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k^2`, `j` is now 1, `r` is now 0**
