According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be adjusted to be a multiple of `k`. Since `j` is increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the new value of `j + 1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`.

State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`; `j` is increased by 1**
