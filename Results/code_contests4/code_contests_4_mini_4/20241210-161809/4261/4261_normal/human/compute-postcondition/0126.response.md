The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially 2, after the execution of the code, `j` will now be 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`i` must be a positive multiple of `k^2` and not a multiple of `k^3`; `j` is 3; `req` contains all unique values including 1 and 2; `r` is 0; `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
