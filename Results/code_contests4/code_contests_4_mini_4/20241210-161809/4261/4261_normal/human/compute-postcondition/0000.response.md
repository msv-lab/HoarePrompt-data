Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing values of any type, and `kwargs` is a dictionary of optional keyword arguments that may include 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. The state of the program indicates that values would be printed to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default, but no changes to the variable states occur.**
