According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop will execute again if `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`, and `j` was increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it must hold that `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. Currently, `j` is 1 greater than it was in the last iteration, meaning it should be adjusted to ensure that `i` remains a multiple of `k` raised to the new exponent.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` must also be a multiple of `k ** (j + 1)`. 

State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `i` must be a multiple of `k`, and `i` must be a multiple of `k ** (j + 1)`**
