The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `i` has been adjusted to `i // k`, but the exact value of `i` is not provided. The variable `j` is now twice its previous value, and it remains an element of `req`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is adjusted to `i // k - 1`, `j` is double its previous value, `j` is an element of `req`.**
