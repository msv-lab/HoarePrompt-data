The value of `j` is assigned to 0. The previous value of `j` was in `req`, and `r` was equal to the previous value of `j`. Now, after the assignment, `r` will also be equal to the new value of `j`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is at least `k + 1`, `j` is now 0, `r` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` is at least `k + 1`, `j` is now 0, `r` is now 0**
