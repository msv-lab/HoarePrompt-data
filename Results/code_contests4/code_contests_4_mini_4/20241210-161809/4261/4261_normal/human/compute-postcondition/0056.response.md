The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. The initial conditions state that `j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is not an element of `req`. After executing the code, `j` will now be an element of `req`. The value of `i` remains unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`i` is adjusted to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is now an element of `req`.**
