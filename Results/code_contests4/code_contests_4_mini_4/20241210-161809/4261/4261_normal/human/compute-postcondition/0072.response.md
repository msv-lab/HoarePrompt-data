The value of `j` is incremented by `r`. Since `r` is defined as 0, the value of `j` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 1 or -1; `j` is greater than or equal to 1; `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations; `r` is 0; `k` must be 1 or -1.

Output State: **`i` is either 1 or -1; `j` is greater than or equal to 1; `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations; `r` is 0; `k` must be 1 or -1.**
