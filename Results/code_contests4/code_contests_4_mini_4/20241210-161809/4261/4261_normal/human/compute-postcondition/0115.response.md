The value of `i` is decremented by 1, which directly affects the variable `i`. The values of `j`, `k`, `r`, and `req` remain unchanged. The new value of `i` will be `i - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k`; `i` is now updated to `i - 1`; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is now in `req`; `r` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k`; `i` is updated to `i - 1`; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is now in `req`; `r` is equal to `j`.**
