The value of `i` is decremented by 1, but its previous value is defined as `i // (k)` which is not directly specified. The values of `j`, `req`, and `r` remain unchanged from their previous state, where `j` is equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`, `j` is not an element of `req`, `req` now contains `j`, and `r` is equal to `j`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `i` and retains the current definitions of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `(i // (k)) - 1`, `j` is equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`, `j` is not an element of `req`, `req` now contains `j`, and `r` is equal to `j`.**
