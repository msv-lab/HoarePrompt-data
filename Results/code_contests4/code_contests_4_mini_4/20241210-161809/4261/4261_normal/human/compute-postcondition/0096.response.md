The variable `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` is the previous value of `j + r`, which means that `j` retains its value as an element of `req`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + r`; `j` is the previous value of `j + r` and now `r` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + r`; `j` is the previous value of `j + r`, `r` is equal to `j`.**
