Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is an element of `req` equal to the last computed value of `j` before the loop terminated, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, and `r` is equal to the last value of `j`. If the original value of `i` was greater than 0, then the loop executed at least once. If the original value of `i` was 0 or less, the loop did not execute and `j`, `r`, and `req` remain unchanged.**
