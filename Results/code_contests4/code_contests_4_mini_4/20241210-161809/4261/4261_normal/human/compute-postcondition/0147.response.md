The value of `j` is incremented by `r`. The initial state mentions that `i` has been reduced to `i // k`, but this does not affect the operation on `j`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `j` while maintaining the information about `i`.

Output State: **`i` is reduced to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`**
