According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a positive integer and has been decreased by 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have been at least 1 before the decrement. Therefore, after decrementing, `i` must now be greater than 0.

Since `i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + r`, and given that `r` is equal to `j`, we know that `j + r` is equal to `2j`. Thus, we need to ensure `i` is at least 1 after being decremented.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0**
