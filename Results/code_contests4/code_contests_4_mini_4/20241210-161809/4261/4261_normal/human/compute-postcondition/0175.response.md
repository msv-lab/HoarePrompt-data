Output State: **`req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is equal to the last computed value of `j`, `i` is less than the original value of `i` for all elements of `li`, and all values in `req` are non-negative integers derived from the computations based on the elements of `li`. The function `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES'.**
