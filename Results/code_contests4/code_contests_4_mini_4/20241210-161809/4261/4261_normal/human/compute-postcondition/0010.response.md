The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to a file, but it does not affect the values of the variables `args`, `x`, or `at_start`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for those variables.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing at least 2 values, `x` is the second value in `args`, `at_start` is False**
