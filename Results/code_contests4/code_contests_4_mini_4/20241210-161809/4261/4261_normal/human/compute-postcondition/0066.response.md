To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to examine the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations
- `r` is 0
- `k` must be 1 or -1

Now, let's analyze the condition:

1. Calculate `k ** (j + 1)`: Since `j` is 1, we have `j + 1` equal to 2. Thus, we need to evaluate `k ** 2`.

2. The condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` translates to `1 % k ** 2 == 0`. 

3. This condition will hold true if `k ** 2` is a divisor of `1`. The only integer divisors of `1` are `1` and `-1`. 

4. Considering the possible values for `k`:
   - If `k = 1`, then `k ** 2 = 1`, and `1 % 1 == 0`, so the loop can execute again.
   - If `k = -1`, then `k ** 2 = 1`, and `1 % 1 == 0`, so it can also execute again.

Given that `k` can be either `1` or `-1`, the loop condition holds true as is, and there is no need to adjust `i`, `j`, or `k` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1**
