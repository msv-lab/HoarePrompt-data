According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will continue executing as long as the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` holds true.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` must be greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`. The value of `j` is currently 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition needs to be satisfied:

1. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` equals 2. Therefore, we need to check if `i % k ** 2 == 0`.
2. Given that `i` is currently a multiple of `k`, we need to ensure that `i` is also a multiple of `k ** 2` for the condition to hold true.
3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to make sure that `i` is a multiple of `k ** 2`.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0, a multiple of `k`, and must be a multiple of `k ** 2`; `j` is 1**
