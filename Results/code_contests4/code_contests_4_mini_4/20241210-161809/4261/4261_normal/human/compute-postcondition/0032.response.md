The variable `i` is assigned the value of `i // (k ** j)`, which means `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Given that `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, the result of this operation will be an integer, specifically `i` divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. The variable `j` remains unchanged, as it is determined by the initial conditions. The variable `r` equal to `req` is also unaffected. 

Output State: **`i` is now equal to `i // (k ** j)`, `j` is the maximum integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, `r` is equal to `req`.**
