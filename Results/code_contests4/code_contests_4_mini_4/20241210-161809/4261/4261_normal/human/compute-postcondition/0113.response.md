The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. The variable `j` is not affected by this operation, but it is confirmed that `j` was not already in `req` prior to this addition. The other variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged. Since `j` was added to `req`, the state of `req` now includes `j`.

Output State: **`j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k`; `i` is updated to `i // k; j` is increased by `r`; `j` is now in `req`.**
