The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values based on the `kwargs` dictionary. The value of `sep` will be the value associated with the key `'sep'` in `kwargs`, and if that key does not exist, it defaults to a space `' '`. Similarly, the value of `file` will be the value associated with the key `'file'` in `kwargs`, and if that key is not present, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The contents of `kwargs` may be altered because of the `pop` method, which removes the specified keys if they exist.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing values of any type; `kwargs` is a dictionary with keys 'sep' and 'file' removed if they existed, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` or ' '; `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`.**
