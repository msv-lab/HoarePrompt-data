The code `func_2('NO')` is a function call, which may or may not alter the state of the variables `i` and `j`. However, since the exact behavior of `func_2` is not specified, we cannot determine if any of the variables are modified or what the return value might be. Thus, the only information we can retain is the state of `i` and `j` based on the initial conditions. 

Since `i` is already reduced to `i // k` and `j` is increased by `r`, those values remain unchanged unless the function modifies them in a way we don't know. The fact that the current value of `j` is in the set `req` remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is reduced to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, and the current value of `j` is in the set `req`.**
