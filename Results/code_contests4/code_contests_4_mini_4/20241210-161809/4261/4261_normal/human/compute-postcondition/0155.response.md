According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is reduced to `(i // k) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0 after this reduction.

To ensure that `i` remains greater than 0, we need to adjust the expression `(i // k) - 1`. This means that before the adjustment, `i // k` must be at least 1, which implies:

1. `i // k` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means `i` must be at least `k` (since integer division will yield 1 when `i` is at least `k`).
2. Therefore, `i` currently must be at least `k + 1` to ensure that after the operation `(i // k) - 1`, it will be still greater than 0.

State: **`i` is at least `k + 1`, `j` is now in `req`, `r` is equal to `j`**
