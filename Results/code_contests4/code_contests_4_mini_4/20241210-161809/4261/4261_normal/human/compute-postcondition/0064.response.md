According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `k` is an unknown value.

For the loop to execute, the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` must hold true. This means that `1 % k ** (0 + 1) == 0` or `1 % k == 0`. This condition implies that `k` must be either 1 or -1 for the loop to execute, as those are the only values that can divide 1 without leaving a remainder. However, `k` is not provided in the state, so we need to ensure that it is defined properly.

Therefore, we can adjust the state to specify that `k` must be 1 or -1 for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `req` contains all unique values of the previous `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `k` must be 1 or -1**
