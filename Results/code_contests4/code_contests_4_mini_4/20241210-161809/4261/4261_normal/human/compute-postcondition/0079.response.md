The value of `i` is decremented by 1, which changes its value. Since `i` was either 1 or -1, the new value of `i` will either be 0 (if it was 1) or -2 (if it was -1). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or -2; `j` is greater than or equal to 1; `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations plus the current value of `j` after this operation; `r` is equal to `j`; `k` must be 1 or -1; `j` is not in `req` (until this operation).
