To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` condition: `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`.

1. **Understanding the condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute, `i` must be equal to `0` when taken modulo `k ** (j + 1)`.

2. **Current state**: We know that `i` must be greater than `0`, which means `i` cannot equal `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `i` is a multiple of `k ** (j + 1)`.

3. **Analyzing `j`**: Since `j` is currently `0`, we get `k ** (j + 1)` as `k ** 1`, which simplifies to `k`. Thus, `i` must be divisible by `k`. 

4. **Adjustments needed**: To ensure that the loop can execute, we can adjust `i` so that it is a positive multiple of `k`. Specifically, we can set `i` to be equal to `k` (if `k` is greater than `0`). 

5. **Other states**: The states `req`, `r`, and `li` do not directly affect the execution of the loop condition, so they do not need adjustments.

Thus, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

State: **`i` must be a positive multiple of `k`, `j` is 0, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0**.
