The value of `j` is assigned to 0. The initial state indicates that `j` is the last computed value based on the current iteration, and since it is now explicitly set to 0, it may no longer reflect the previous computed value during the loop. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations, `r` is 0, and `li` must contain at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.
