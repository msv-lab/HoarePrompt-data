The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, but since there is no operation affecting `i` in the provided code, its value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are also not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`; `j` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`; `j` is incremented by 1**.
