The value of `r` is assigned the current value of `j`. The variable `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and since `j` is not in `req`, it will now be added to `req` in the next iteration of the loop (if applicable). The variables `i`, `k`, and `req` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is either 1 or -1; `j` is greater than or equal to 1; `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations plus the current value of `j` after this operation; `r` is equal to `j`; `k` must be 1 or -1; `j` is not in `req` (until this operation).**
