The variable `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is a multiple of `k^j` divided by `k^j`, and since `j` is unchanged and not an element of `req`, `req` now includes `j`. The states of `j`, `r`, and `req` remain the same, while `i` is updated to be `i - 1`. 

Output State: **`j` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is a multiple of `k^j` divided by `k^j` minus 1, `r` is equal to `j`, `j` remains unchanged, `j` is not an element of `req`, and `req` now includes `j`.**
