The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `j` must be at least 1, so after the increment, `j` will be at least 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`i` is at least `2*k`, `j` is at least 2, and `i` must be adjusted to ensure it is divisible by `k`.**
