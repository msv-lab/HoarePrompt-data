The function `func_2('NO')` is invoked, but without the function's implementation provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables based on its logic. However, we can infer that:

- The values of `i` and `j` are unchanged as there are no operations affecting them within the provided code snippet.
- The initial condition states that `j` is equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`, and the current value of `j` is in `req`, which remains valid.

Therefore, since the state of `i`, `j`, and any relevant context remains unchanged, the output state reflects that no specific alterations have occurred.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `i // (k)`; `j` is equal to the previous value of `j` plus `r`, and the current value of `j` is in `req`.**
