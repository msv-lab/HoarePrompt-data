The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The precondition states that `i` must be adjusted to be a multiple of `k`, but the value of `j` does not affect `i` or `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects only the change in `j`, without affecting the conditions regarding `i` and `k`.

Output State: **`i` must be adjusted to be a multiple of `k`; `j` is increased by 1**
