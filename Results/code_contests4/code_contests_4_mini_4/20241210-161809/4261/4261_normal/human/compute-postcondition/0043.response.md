To determine the adjustments needed to ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while i % k ** (j + 1) == 0:
```

The loop can proceed if the expression `i % k ** (j + 1)` evaluates to `0`. This means that `i` must be divisible by `k ** (j + 1)`.

Given the current states:
- `i` must be at least `2*k`
- `j` is `0`
- `j` is not an element of `req`
- `req` now contains `j`
- `r` is equal to `0`

Now, substituting the value of `j` into the condition:
- Since `j` is `0`, we have `j + 1` equal to `1`. Therefore, the condition becomes:
  
```
i % k ** 1 == 0  => i % k == 0
```

Next, we check the value of `i`:
- For the loop to execute, `i` must be divisible by `k`. Since `i` must be at least `2*k`, `i` is guaranteed to be divisible by `k` (because `2*k` is a multiple of `k`).

Thus, `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is already sufficient (`i >= 2*k`).

Now we check the other states. The conditions surrounding `j`, `req`, and `r` are irrelevant for the loop's execution since they do not affect the divisibility condition.

In conclusion, since all necessary conditions for the loop to execute at least once are satisfied:

State: **`i` is at least `2*k`, `j` is 0, `j` is not an element of `req`, `req` now contains `j`, and `r` is equal to 0**.
