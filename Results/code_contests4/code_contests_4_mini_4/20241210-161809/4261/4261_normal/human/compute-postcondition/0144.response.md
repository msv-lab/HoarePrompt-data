The value of `j` is incremented by 1, which updates its previous value, but the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. The initial condition that `i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1` still holds true, but now `j` is one unit greater.

Output State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`; `j` is now increased by 1**
