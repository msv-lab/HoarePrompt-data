The variable `i` is assigned the value of `i // (k ** j)`, where `i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`. This means that after the operation, `i` will be reduced by the factor of `k ** j`. The value of `j` is defined as the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `(j + 1)`. Therefore, after the operation, `i` will no longer be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer that is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and after execution, `i` is reduced to `i // (k ** j)`. `j` remains the same.**
