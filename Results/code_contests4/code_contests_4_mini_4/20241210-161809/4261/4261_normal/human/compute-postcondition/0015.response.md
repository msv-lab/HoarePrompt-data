The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to a file. The variables `args`, `x`, and `at_start` are not directly modified by this code. The state of `args` remains a variable-length argument list containing at least 3 values, and `x` remains the third value in that list. The variable `at_start` also remains True. However, the operation implies that something is written to the file, but this does not change the state of the existing variables.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing at least 3 values, `x` is the third value in `args`, `at_start` is True, and `sep` has been written to the file.**
