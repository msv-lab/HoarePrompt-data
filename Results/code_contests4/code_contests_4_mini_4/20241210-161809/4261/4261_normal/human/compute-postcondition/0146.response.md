After executing the code `i //= k ** j`, `i` is updated to be the result of integer division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `i` is a multiple of `k ** j`, `i` will be reduced to `i // (k ** j)`, which is an integer. The values of `j`, `req`, `r`, and `li` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is reduced to `i // (k ** j)`, `j` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `req` contains all unique values from 1 to the final value of `j` including the final value of `j`, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `li` contains at least one more element than before and must contain at least one element that is greater than 0.**
