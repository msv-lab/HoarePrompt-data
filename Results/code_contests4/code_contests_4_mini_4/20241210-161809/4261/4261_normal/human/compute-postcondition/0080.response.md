According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or -2, which means it is not greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be greater than 0.

Since `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `req` contains all unique values of `j`, and `r` is equal to `j`, these states do not need adjustment for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, `k` must be 1 or -1, and since it does not affect the execution condition of `i`, it does not need to be adjusted either.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0**
