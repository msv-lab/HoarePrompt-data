The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial state indicates that `j` is at least 2, so after the execution, the new value of `j` will be at least 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and all other conditions regarding the variables stay valid.

Output State: **`i` must be adjusted to ensure it is divisible by `k^3`, `j` is at least 3**.
