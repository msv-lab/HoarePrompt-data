The variable `j` is incremented by 1, which means its previous value is increased by 1. The conditions for `i` remain unchanged: `i` must still be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, as well as a multiple of `k` raised to the power of the new value of `j + 1`. Therefore, the previous conditions for `i` remain valid, and now `j` has been updated.

Output State: **`i` must be a multiple of `k` and at least `k + 1`, and `i` must also be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, where `j` has been incremented by 1.**
