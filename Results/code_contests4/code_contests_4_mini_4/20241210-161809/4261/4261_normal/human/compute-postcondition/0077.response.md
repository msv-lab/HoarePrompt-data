The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. Since `j` is not already in `req`, it will be successfully added. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `req` variable, which now includes `j`.

Output State: **`i` is either 1 or -1; `j` is greater than or equal to 1; `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the loop iterations plus the current value of `j`; `r` is 0; `k` must be 1 or -1; `j` is not in `req` (until this operation).**
