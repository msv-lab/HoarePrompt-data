To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we must analyze the core logic of the `func_1` function and see if it meets the requirements specified.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We start with an array `v` initialized to zero.
2. We can add powers of `k` (i.e., `k^0`, `k^1`, ...) to any position in the array `v`.
3. The goal is to determine if we can achieve a target array `a` using the allowed operations.

### Key Observations:
- Each element in `a` can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of `k`. For example, if `a[i] = 5` and `k = 2`, we can express this as `2^2 + 2^0`, which corresponds to the binary representation of `5`.
- The program must ensure that no power of `k` is counted twice for different positions in `a`. This means the powers of `k` need to be unique across the indices of `a`.

### Analyzing `func_1`:
- The function initializes a set `req` to track the powers of `k` that we are using to form the elements of `a`.
- It iterates through each element `i` in `li` (which corresponds to `a`).
- Inside the loop, it counts how many times `i` can be divided by increasing powers of `k` and keeps track of the current "power index" (`j`).
- If a "power index" (`j`) has already been used (exists in `req`), it returns "NO".
- If all elements of `li` are processed without conflicts, it returns "YES".

### Edge Cases:
- The algorithm must account for the case when `a` contains zeros. If `a` contains only zeros, the output should be "YES" since we can skip all steps.
- The algorithm must correctly handle large values in `a` (up to `10^16`), which is feasible since it checks divisibility and uses integer arithmetic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the array `v` can be transformed into the target array `a`. It checks for the uniqueness of the used powers of `k`, ensuring that no two positions in `v` can use the same power.

Thus, the program adheres to the specified problem requirements.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True**
