Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to properly check if the maximum dimensions that maintain the ratio x:y can be achieved without exceeding the original dimensions a and b.

For example, consider the following input:
```
a = 800, b = 600, x = 2, y = 1
```
In this case, the expected output should be the maximum rectangle that can maintain the ratio 2:1 without exceeding 800 and 600. The maximum width based on the original a (800) would be 800, and the corresponding height that maintains the ratio would be 400 (since 800 / 2 = 400). This fits within the original dimensions.

However, if we were to use the current implementation, it would not correctly return the maximum size that fits within the ratio, as the logic does not properly check all possible cases. The use of `gcd` and the logic in `func_1` is not utilized correctly within the main flow of the program, leading to potential incorrect outputs in various scenarios.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the desired ratio x:y cannot be achieved at all, as it does not check if x and y can produce valid dimensions under the constraints of a and b before proceeding to calculate with them.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements described in the problem statement correctly for all inputs.
