You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Reca company makes monitors, the most popular of their models is AB999 with the screen size a × b centimeters. Because of some production peculiarities a screen parameters are integer numbers. Recently the screen sides ratio x: y became popular with users. That's why the company wants to reduce monitor AB999 size so that its screen sides ratio becomes x: y, at the same time they want its total area to be maximal of all possible variants. Your task is to find the screen parameters of the reduced size model, or find out that such a reduction can't be performed.

Input

The first line of the input contains 4 integers — a, b, x and y (1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·109).

Output

If the answer exists, output 2 positive integers — screen parameters of the reduced size model. Output 0 0 otherwise.

Examples

Input

800 600 4 3


Output

800 600


Input

1920 1200 16 9


Output

1920 1080


Input

1 1 1 2


Output

0 0
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
from sys import stdin
from fractions import gcd

rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(a, b, x, y) = rints()
g = gcd(x, y)
x //= g
y //= g
mi = min(a // x, b // y)
print(mi * x, mi * y)

def func_1(be, en):
    while be < en:
        mid = (be + en + 1) // 2
        if x * mid <= a and y * mid <= b:
            be = mid
        else:
            en = mid - 1
    print(be * x, be * y)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
