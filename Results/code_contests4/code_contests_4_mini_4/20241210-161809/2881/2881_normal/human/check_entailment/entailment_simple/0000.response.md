To determine the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program should take four integers: `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`.
2. It must find the largest possible dimensions of a screen that maintains the ratio `x:y` while being less than or equal to the dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. If such dimensions exist, it should print them; otherwise, it should print `0 0`.

### Program Analysis:
The given program performs the following:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the integers from standard input.
2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: It simplifies the ratio `x:y` by dividing both x and y by their GCD.
3. **Finding Maximum Size**:
   - It calculates `mi`, which is the maximum integer such that both `x * mi <= a` and `y * mi <= b`. This is done using integer division.
   - It then prints the dimensions `mi * x` and `mi * y`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Use of `gcd`**: The program uses `gcd` but the function is not correctly imported or used. It references `gcd` from the `fractions` module, which is not suitable in this context. In Python 3.x, we should use `math.gcd`.
2. **Redundant Function**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called. The logic for calculating the maximum size is done prior to this function, making it unnecessary.
3. **Output Condition**: The program does not check if `mi` is 0 before printing the dimensions. If `mi` is 0, it should output `0 0`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The primary issue is that it does not account for the case where no valid sizes exist (i.e., when `mi` is calculated as 0). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of the problem description when such a case occurs.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program fails to handle cases where the maximum size cannot be achieved, thereby not following the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**
