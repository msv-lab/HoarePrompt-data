Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure the maximal area of the screen parameters while adhering to the specified ratio of x:y. The output hints indicate that there is a binary search function `func_1` that is intended to find the maximum possible value for `mid` such that the adjusted dimensions fit within the original dimensions. However, this function is never called in the code, meaning the relevant logic for finding the maximum area based on the ratio is not executed.

Moreover, the output directly computed from the initial calculations does not account for cases where the dimensions after applying the ratio exceed the original dimensions. Specifically, there are cases where the ratio leads to a configuration that cannot fit within the original dimensions, which should return `0 0`, but the current implementation does not handle this.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 1 2
```
The expected output is `0 0` since the dimensions cannot maintain the specified ratio. However, the program would incorrectly produce dimensions based on the initial division, which would result in incorrect outputs.

Thus, because there are scenarios where the program does not handle reductions correctly, it fails to meet the problem requirements for every potential case.
