To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the problem and what the program is doing step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to resize a monitor of size `a Ã— b` to a new size that maintains the ratio `x : y` while maximizing the area of the new size. The output should either be the new dimensions or `0 0` if resizing is not possible.

### Annotations in the Program
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads four integers `a, b, x, y`.
2. **GCD Calculation**: It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`, and reduces `x` and `y` by this GCD to obtain the simplified ratio.
3. **Finding Maximum Scale**: The code determines the maximum integer `mi` such that:
   - `mi * x <= a`
   - `mi * y <= b`
   This is done using integer division and taking the minimum of the two ratios, ensuring that the new dimensions will fit within the original monitor dimensions.
4. **Output Dimensions**: It prints the new dimensions as `mi * x` and `mi * y`.

### Evaluation of Correctness
The steps of the program align with the requirements:

- The program first reduces the ratio `x:y` to its simplest form. This ensures that the resulting dimensions maintain the correct aspect ratio after resizing.
- The calculation of `mi` ensures that the new dimensions do not exceed the original dimensions, which is a requirement from the problem description.
- The output is correct as it provides the dimensions of the resized monitor or `0 0` when resizing is not possible.

### Edge Cases
- The program will return `0 0` if the maximum integer `mi` calculated is `0`, which would occur if `x > a` or `y > b` after reduction. This correctly handles cases where the desired aspect ratio cannot be achieved given the original dimensions.

Thus, the annotated program effectively implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
Since the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
