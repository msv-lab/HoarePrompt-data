According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `be` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `be` is less than `en`, which means the loop can execute again.

However, since the loop's exit condition is `be < en`, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition must still hold. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary because `be` is already less than `en`.

State: **`be` is less than `en`**
