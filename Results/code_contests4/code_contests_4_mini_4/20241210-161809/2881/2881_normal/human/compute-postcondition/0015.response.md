The value of `en` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`, we can express `mid` in terms of `be` and `en`. After substituting and calculating, we find that `en` will be less than `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is less than `en`; `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and `en` is now equal to `((be + en + 1) // 2) - 1`.

Output State: **`be` is less than `en`; `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`; `en` is equal to `((be + en + 1) // 2) - 1**
