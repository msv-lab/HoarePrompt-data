The code prints the results of the expressions `be * x` and `be * y`. The variable `be` is equal to `en`, which is determined by the maximum integer satisfying the conditions `x * be <= a` and `y * be <= b`. Since the `print` function does not affect variable values, the output state will include the unchanged variables and the results of the multiplications.

Output State: **`be` is equal to `en`, which is the maximum integer such that `x * be <= a` and `y * be <= b`; printed values are `be * x` and `be * y`.**
