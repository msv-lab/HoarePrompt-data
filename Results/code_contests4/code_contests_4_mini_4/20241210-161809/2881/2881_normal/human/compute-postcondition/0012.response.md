According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop can continue executing as long as `be` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is less than `en`, which means there is still a possibility for the loop to execute again. 

Since the loop condition `while be < en` is already satisfied, no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`be` is less than `en`**
