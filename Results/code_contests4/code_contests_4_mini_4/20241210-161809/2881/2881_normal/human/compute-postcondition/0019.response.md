The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `be` and `en`. Both `be` and `en` are tuples containing four integers: `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9. The function likely processes these integer values in some manner, but since the specific output cases are not provided, we cannot detail them. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two tuples of integers that represent specific values and return a value based on the processing of these integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples `be` and `en`, each containing four integers (a, b, x, y) within the range of 1 to 2·10^9.**
