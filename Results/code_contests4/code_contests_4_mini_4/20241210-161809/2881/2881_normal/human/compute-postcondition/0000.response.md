According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `be` is less than `en`. Given that `be` and `en` are both integers within the range of 1 to 2Â·10^9, for the loop to execute for the first time, it is necessary that `be` is less than `en`.

Since we are not given specific values for `be` and `en`, we can infer that `be` must be less than `en` for the condition to hold true. Therefore, if `be` is equal to or greater than `en`, we need to adjust the values accordingly.

To ensure the loop can execute, we can state that `en` must be greater than `be`. 

State: **`be` must be less than `en`**
