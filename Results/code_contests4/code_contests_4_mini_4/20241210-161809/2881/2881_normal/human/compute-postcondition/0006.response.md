Postcondition: ***`be` is less than `en`. If `x * mid` ≤ `a` and `y * mid` ≤ `b`, then `be` is updated to `mid` and `mid` remains equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, either `x * mid > a`, `y * mid > b`, or both, leading to `en` being updated to `mid - 1`, while `mid` continues to be equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`.***
