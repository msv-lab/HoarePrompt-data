To analyze the output state after the while loop executes, we will consider the conditions under which the loop operates and how the variables change over its iterations.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues while `be < en`.
2. **Variable Updates**:
   - If `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, then `be` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `en` is updated to `mid - 1`.

From the initial state, we have four integers: `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, where \(1 \leq a, b, x, y \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).

After the loop executes:

- The loop will terminate when `be` is no longer less than `en`, which means that when the loop exits, it must be true that `be` is equal to `en`.
- The final state of `be` and `en` will be the same, indicating that the maximum value that satisfies the conditions set by the inequalities involving `x` and `y` has been found.

Given this, we can summarize the output state based on the iterations:

- After the last iteration, `be` and `en` converge to the same value, which is the largest integer that can satisfy the conditions `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`.
- The exact values of `be` and `en` would depend on the initial values of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, but the following must hold true:

Output State: **`be` is equal to `en`, which is the maximum integer such that `x * be <= a` and `y * be <= b`.**
