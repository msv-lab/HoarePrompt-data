The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`. Given that `be` must be less than `en`, the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2` computes the midpoint between `be` and `en`, rounding up in case of an odd sum. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`be` must be less than `en`; `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`.**
