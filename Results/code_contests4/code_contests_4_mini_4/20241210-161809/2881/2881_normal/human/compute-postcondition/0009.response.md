`be` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is calculated as `(be + en + 1) // 2`. Since `be` is less than `en`, `mid` will be a value that is still less than `en`. The value of `be` is now equal to `mid`, and `mid` is half of the sum of `be`, `en`, and 1, effectively changing the relationship between `be` and `en`. The state of `en` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`be` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`; `en` is unchanged; `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2` before the assignment.**
