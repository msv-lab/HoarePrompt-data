The value of `mid` is assigned the result of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`. Given that `be` is less than `en`, the sum `be + en + 1` will be a positive integer. The division by 2 using `//` will yield an integer value for `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is less than `en`; `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`be` is less than `en`; `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`.**
