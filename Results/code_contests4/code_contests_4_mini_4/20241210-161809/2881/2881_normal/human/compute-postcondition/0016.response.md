Postcondition: ***`be` is less than `en` and `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`. If `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`, then `be` remains unchanged and `en` is unchanged, with `mid` still equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `be` is less than `en`, `mid` is equal to `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and `en` is updated to `((be + en + 1) // 2) - 1`.***
