The function accepts two integers `be` and `en` and performs a binary search to find the maximum integer `mid` such that `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`. After determining this maximum value, it prints the products `be * x` and `be * y`. The function does not return any values but outputs the results directly.
