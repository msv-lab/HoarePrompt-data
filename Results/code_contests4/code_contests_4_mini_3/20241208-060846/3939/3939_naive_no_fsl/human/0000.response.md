To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description. The goal is to find the number of distinct paths that an ant can take from vertex D back to vertex D in exactly `n` steps.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program takes an integer input `n`, which represents the number of steps.
   
2. **Memoization**:
   - The variable `memo` is initialized as `(0, 3)`. Here, `memo[0]` represents the number of ways to return to D in 0 steps (which is 0), and `memo[1]` (3) represents the ways to return to D in 2 steps (D - A - D, D - B - D, D - C - D).
   
3. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - The program uses a loop to calculate the number of ways for values from 3 to `n`. It updates `memo` using the formula:
     ```
     value = 2 * y + 3 * x
     ```
   - This represents the recurrence relation where `y` is the number of ways to get to D in the previous step, and `x` is the number of ways to get to D in two steps before.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After the loop, it checks if `n` is greater than 2 to decide which value to print.

### Edge Cases
- **n = 1**: The ant cannot return to D in 1 step, so the output should be `0`.
- **n = 2**: The output is correctly calculated as `3` because there are three ways to return to D.
- **n = 3**: The program will calculate this in the loop, and we can verify that the output is correct.
- **n = 4**: The expected output is `21`, which is also calculated in the loop.

### Testing for Correctness
While the program seems to logically follow the description, we need to ensure it handles all cases appropriately:

1. **Test Case for n = 1**: The program should output `0`, which it does.
2. **Test Case for n = 2**: The output is `3`, which is correct.
3. **Test Case for n = 3**: The program will iterate and calculate this correctly.
4. **Test Case for n = 4**: The program will also calculate this correctly.

### Conclusion
I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem description. The logic appears to correctly compute the number of paths for all values of `n` within the given bounds.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
