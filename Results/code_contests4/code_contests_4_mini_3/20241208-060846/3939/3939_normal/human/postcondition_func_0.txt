The function does not accept any parameters and computes a value based on user input representing a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7). If `n` is greater than 2, it performs a calculation over `n - 2` iterations and prints the second element of the `memo` tuple. If `n` is equal to 1, it prints 0; if `n` is equal to 2, it prints 3. The function handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by printing default values, but it does not account for inputs that are not positive integers, which could lead to errors.
