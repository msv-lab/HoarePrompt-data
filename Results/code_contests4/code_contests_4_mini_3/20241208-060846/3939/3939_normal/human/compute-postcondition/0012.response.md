`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the tuple `memo`, where `memo` is (6, 21). Therefore, `x` is assigned the value 6 and `y` is assigned the value 21. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of an integer greater than 3, `i` is 2, `memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 21.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than 3, `i` is 2, `memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 21**
