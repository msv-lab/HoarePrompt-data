`memo` is assigned the value of `y`, which is 3, and then the result of `value % MOD`. Here, `value` is 6 and `MOD` is 1000000007. The calculation `6 % 1000000007` results in 6. Therefore, `memo` is now (3, 6). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 0, `y` is 3, `value` is 6**
