In the code snippet, `memo` is assigned the value of `y` and `value % MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables are `y` is 21 and `value` is 60. 

First, we calculate `value % MOD`:
- `value` is 60
- `MOD` is 1000000007
- Therefore, `value % MOD` is 60 since 60 is much less than 1000000007.

Now, `memo` will be updated to `(y, value % MOD)`, which evaluates to `(21, 60)`.

The states of the other variables `n`, `i`, `MOD`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than 3, `i` is 2, `memo` is (21, 60), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 60**
