In the given code, `value` is assigned the result of the expression `2 * y + 3 * x`. The current values of `y` and `x` are 21 and 6, respectively.

Now, we calculate:
- `2 * y` = `2 * 21` = `42`
- `3 * x` = `3 * 6` = `18`
- Therefore, `value` = `42 + 18` = `60`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `memo`, `MOD`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than 3, `i` is 2, `memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 60**.
