The variable `memo` is assigned the tuple value `(0, 3)`. The previous value of `n`, which is a string from user input, does not affect the assignment of `memo`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string from user input, `memo` is (0, 3).

Output State: **`n` is a string from user input, `memo` is (0, 3)**
