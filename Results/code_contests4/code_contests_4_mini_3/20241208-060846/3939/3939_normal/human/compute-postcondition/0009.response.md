The variable `value` is assigned the result of the expression `2 * y + 3 * x`. The previous values are `y` is 6 and `x` is 3. Therefore, we calculate `value` as follows:

```
value = 2 * 6 + 3 * 3
value = 12 + 9
value = 21
```

Thus, after execution, `value` is now 21. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 21.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 21**
