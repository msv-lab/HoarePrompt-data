The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the tuple `memo`. In this case, `memo` is (0, 3), so `x` will be assigned the value 0 and `y` will be assigned the value 3. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `MOD`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 0, and `y` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 0, `y` is 3**
