`x` is assigned the first value from `memo`, which is 3, and `y` is assigned the second value from `memo`, which is 6. The values of `n`, `i`, `MOD`, and `value` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 6**
