The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. Since the initial state states that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7, after executing the code, `n` will now be a string representation of the input provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7, and now `n` is a string from user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7, and now `n` is a string from user input.**
