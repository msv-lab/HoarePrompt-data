`MOD` is assigned the value of \(10^9 + 7\), which is a constant used in programming for modulo operations. The previous values of `n` and `memo` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string from user input, `memo` is (0, 3), and `MOD` is 1000000007.

Output State: **`n` is a string from user input, `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007**
