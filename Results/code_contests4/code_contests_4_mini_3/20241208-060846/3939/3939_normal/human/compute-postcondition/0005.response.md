The variable `value` is assigned the expression `2 * y + 3 * x`. Given that `y` is 3 and `x` is 0, we can calculate:

- `2 * y` = `2 * 3` = 6
- `3 * x` = `3 * 0` = 0

Now, adding these two results together:

`value` = 6 + 0 = 6

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 0, `y` is 3, `value` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 0, `y` is 3, `value` is 6**
