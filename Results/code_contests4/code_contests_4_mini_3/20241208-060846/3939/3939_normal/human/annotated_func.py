#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    n = input()
    memo = 0, 3
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(n - 2):
        x, y = memo
        
        value = 2 * y + 3 * x
        
        memo = y, value % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `memo` is the final computed values after `n - 2` iterations, `MOD` is 1000000007.
    if (n > 2) :
        print(memo[1])
    else :
        print(0 if n == 1 else 3)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, `memo[1]` is printed. Otherwise, the output is 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and computes a value based on user input representing a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7). If `n` is greater than 2, it performs a calculation over `n - 2` iterations and prints the second element of the `memo` tuple. If `n` is equal to 1, it prints 0; if `n` is equal to 2, it prints 3. The function handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by printing default values, but it does not account for inputs that are not positive integers, which could lead to errors.
