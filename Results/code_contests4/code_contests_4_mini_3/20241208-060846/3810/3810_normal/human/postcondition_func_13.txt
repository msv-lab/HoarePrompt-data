The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of universities and a list `y` of tuples. It returns the integer result of dividing `x` by the length of `y`. If `x` is not evenly divisible by the length of `y`, it adds 1 to the result, effectively rounding up the division. However, the code incorrectly attempts to use `y` directly in the division condition instead of `len(y)`, which could lead to an error if `y` is not treated as the length of the list. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `y` is empty, which would lead to a division by zero error.
