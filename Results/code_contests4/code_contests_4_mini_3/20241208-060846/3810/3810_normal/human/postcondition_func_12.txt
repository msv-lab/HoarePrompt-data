The function accepts a positive integer `n` and an integer `r`, and returns the value of `n` choose `r`, calculated as `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))`. However, it does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would result in incorrect behavior or a mathematical error, as the combination is undefined in such cases. It also does not validate the input values or check for potential overflow in factorial calculations.
