The function accepts three positive integers `x`, `y`, and `p`, and computes `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. The function returns the result of this computation, which can vary based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `p`. If `y` is 0, it will always return 1 since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
