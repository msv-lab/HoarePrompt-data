The function accepts a list of tuples `n`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns a flattened list of integers formed by converting the entire list of tuples into a string and then back to integers, resulting in a single list of digits rather than individual integers from the tuples. This could lead to unexpected results if the tuples contain multi-digit integers.
