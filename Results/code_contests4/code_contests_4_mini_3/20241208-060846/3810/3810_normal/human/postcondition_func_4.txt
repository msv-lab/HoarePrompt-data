The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`, which processes positive integers `ni`, `li`, and `ri` for `t` universities, where `t` is between 1 and 1000, and each of `ni`, `li`, `ri` is between 1 and 10^9 with the condition that `li` is less than or equal to `ri`. The details of the processing performed by `func_3()` are not specified in this code snippet.
