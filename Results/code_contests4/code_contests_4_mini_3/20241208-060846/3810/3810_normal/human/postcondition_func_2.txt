The function accepts input from the user, which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers representing values for ni, li, and ri for each of the t universities. It returns a map object of these integers, which can be converted to a list. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where the input format may be incorrect or outside the specified range, as it assumes the input is valid.
