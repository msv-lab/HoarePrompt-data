To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the situation step by step.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine for each university if it is possible to gather an exact sum of `ni` berubleys using only coins with denominations ranging from `li` to `ri`. Alexey can use any number of coins of each denomination.

### Analysis of Code:
The relevant function is `func_19`, which processes each university's parameters `ni`, `li`, and `ri`. The logic uses binary search to find if there exists a positive integer `mid` such that the product of `l` and `mid` is less than or equal to `n` and the product of `r` and `mid` is greater than or equal to `n`.

1. The conditions to check are:
   - \( l \times mid \leq n \)
   - \( r \times mid \geq n \)

2. The binary search iterates while `low` is less than or equal to `high`, adjusting `low` and `high` based on whether the conditions hold.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `ni` is less than `li`:** In such a case, it would be impossible to form `ni` since the smallest denomination `li` is greater than `ni`. This should directly yield a "No".
  
2. **When `li` equals `ri`:** In this specific case, the only coin denomination available is `li`. Therefore, `ni` must be an exact multiple of `li` to yield a "Yes". If it isn't, it should return "No".

### Output Hints:
The hints suggest that the function should be able to handle the cases provided in the problem description. Specifically:
- For the input `5 2 3`, Alexey can use one coin of denomination `2` and another of denomination `3` to make `5`, which is correct.
- For `6 4 5`, neither `4` nor `5` can combine to make `6`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
Now, checking through the edge cases identified:
- The code does not account for the scenario where `ni < li`, which should return "No" immediately.
- In the case where `li` equals `ri`, the logic must ensure that `ni` is a multiple of `li` for a valid answer.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**

### Reason:
The program fails to consider cases where `ni` is less than `li`, and also does not correctly handle cases where `li` equals `ri` unless `ni` is an exact multiple of `li`. This indicates that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
