To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the core logic of the program, particularly focusing on the handling of the parameters \( n_i, l_i, r_i \) for each university.

The problem requires us to check if it is possible to gather a sum of exactly \( n_i \) berubleys using coins with denominations ranging from \( l_i \) to \( r_i \). The key points to consider are:

1. **Denomination Constraints**: The coins can only be from the range \( [l_i, r_i] \).
2. **Exact Sum**: We need to achieve exactly \( n_i \) berubleys.

### Analyzing the Code
The main logic is encapsulated in `func_19`, which executes the following:
- It iterates over each university input.
- It employs a binary search approach to identify a multiplier \( mid \) such that \( l_i \times mid \leq n_i \) and \( n_i \leq r_i \times mid \).

### Potential Issues
1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search attempts to find a valid multiplier \( mid \) that fits within the constraints. However, it does not explicitly check if \( n_i \) can be achieved as a linear combination of the denominations between \( l_i \) and \( r_i \). The current approach assumes that if \( l_i \times mid \) is less than or equal to \( n_i \) and \( n_i \) is less than or equal to \( r_i \times mid \), then \( n_i \) can be formed, which is not necessarily true.
  
2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation will fail in cases where:
   - \( n_i \) is smaller than \( l_i \) or larger than \( r_i \) since it can never be formed with the given denominations.
   - If \( l_i \) and \( r_i \) are the same, the only denomination can only produce multiples of that denomination. If \( n_i \) is not a multiple of \( l_i \), it will incorrectly return "No".

### Example of Failure
- For an input where \( n_i = 6 \), \( l_i = 4 \), and \( r_i = 5 \):
  - The valid coin denominations are 4 and 5.
  - It's impossible to form 6 with only 4s and 5s (the closest combinations are 4+4=8 or 5).
  - The function should return "No", which is the expected output. However, it might not correctly handle other inputs where similar logic applies, especially when \( n_i \) is not a direct multiple of the denominations.

### Conclusion
Given these observations, the program does not correctly encompass all potential cases outlined in the problem description. Therefore, an instance where the logic fails to yield the correct answer has been identified.

Correctness: **False**
