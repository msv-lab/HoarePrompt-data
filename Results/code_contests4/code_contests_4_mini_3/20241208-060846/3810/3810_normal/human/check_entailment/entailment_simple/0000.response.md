To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the main logic of the program that addresses the key requirements of the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: For each university, we have three integers: `ni` (the exact donation amount), `li` (the minimum denomination of coins), and `ri` (the maximum denomination of coins).
2. **Output**: For each university, we need to determine if it's possible to pay exactly `ni` using coins of denominations ranging from `li` to `ri`, using an unlimited number of coins.

### Key Logic:
The program implements a binary search to check if it is possible to achieve the exact donation `ni` using multiples of the denominations within the allowed range.

- For each university, it calculates the product of `li` and a midpoint `mid`, and the product of `ri` and `mid`. This gives the range of sums that can be formed using `mid` coins of the minimum and maximum denominations.
- The logic checks whether `n` falls within the range `[l * mid, r * mid]`. If so, it sets a flag (`f`) indicating that it's possible to make the donation.
- If `f` is set to 1, it outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

### Correctness Check:
- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic is fundamentally sound because it checks all potential multiples of the denominations and ensures that `ni` can be represented within the bounds of `li` and `ri`. 
- **Edge Cases**: The program also considers the case when `li` and `ri` are very close to `ni`, and when `ni` is less than `li` or more than `ri`. 
- **Performance**: Given the constraints (up to 1,000 universities and values up to \(10^9\)), the binary search approach is efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to assess whether the exact donation amount can be formed with the available denominations, adhering closely to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
