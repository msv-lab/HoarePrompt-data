You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alexey, a merry Berland entrant, got sick of the gray reality and he zealously wants to go to university. There are a lot of universities nowadays, so Alexey is getting lost in the diversity — he has not yet decided what profession he wants to get. At school, he had bad grades in all subjects, and it's only thanks to wealthy parents that he was able to obtain the graduation certificate.

The situation is complicated by the fact that each high education institution has the determined amount of voluntary donations, paid by the new students for admission — ni berubleys. He cannot pay more than ni, because then the difference between the paid amount and ni can be regarded as a bribe!

Each rector is wearing the distinctive uniform of his university. Therefore, the uniform's pockets cannot contain coins of denomination more than ri. The rector also does not carry coins of denomination less than li in his pocket — because if everyone pays him with so small coins, they gather a lot of weight and the pocket tears. Therefore, a donation can be paid only by coins of denomination x berubleys, where li ≤ x ≤ ri (Berland uses coins of any positive integer denomination). Alexey can use the coins of different denominations and he can use the coins of the same denomination any number of times. When Alexey was first confronted with such orders, he was puzzled because it turned out that not all universities can accept him! Alexey is very afraid of going into the army (even though he had long wanted to get the green uniform, but his dad says that the army bullies will beat his son and he cannot pay to ensure the boy's safety). So, Alexey wants to know for sure which universities he can enter so that he could quickly choose his alma mater.

Thanks to the parents, Alexey is not limited in money and we can assume that he has an unlimited number of coins of each type.

In other words, you are given t requests, each of them contains numbers ni, li, ri. For each query you need to answer, whether it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from li to ri berubleys. You can use coins of different denominations. Coins of each denomination can be used any number of times.

Input

The first line contains the number of universities t, (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) Each of the next t lines contain three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 109; li ≤ ri).

Output

For each query print on a single line: either "Yes", if Alexey can enter the university, or "No" otherwise.

Examples

Input

2
5 2 3
6 4 5


Output

Yes
No

Note

You can pay the donation to the first university with two coins: one of denomination 2 and one of denomination 3 berubleys. The donation to the second university cannot be paid.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a positive integer input by the user, which represents a university's value or identifier. It does not handle cases where the input might not be a positive integer or where input might be invalid; thus, it assumes valid input is provided.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and simply returns the input data from the user, which is expected to include the number of universities and their respective values ni, li, and ri. However, it does not perform any processing or validation of these values, nor does it handle cases where input might not conform to the expected format or constraints.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts input from the user, which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers representing values for ni, li, and ri for each of the t universities. It returns a map object of these integers, which can be converted to a list. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where the input format may be incorrect or outside the specified range, as it assumes the input is valid.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and reads a single line of space-separated integers from input, returning a map object of their string representations. It does not process or validate the integers ni, li, and ri directly; it simply returns the input as strings in a map object.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`, which processes positive integers `ni`, `li`, and `ri` for `t` universities, where `t` is between 1 and 1000, and each of `ni`, `li`, `ri` is between 1 and 10^9 with the condition that `li` is less than or equal to `ri`. The details of the processing performed by `func_3()` are not specified in this code snippet.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` initializes a new thread that runs the `main` function. It accepts no parameters and does not return any value. The code suggests that it is designed to handle a scenario involving a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of universities, but the actual implementation of how this integer is used is not present within the function. Therefore, the function's current implementation does not handle or process the integer `t` or the associated parameters `ni`, `li`, and `ri`.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the second tuple in the list, which includes three integers (n1, l1, r1) that satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ n1, l1, r1 ≤ 10^9 and l1 ≤ r1. If the list contains fewer than two tuples, the function will raise an IndexError.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key function `getKey`. There are no checks for the validity of the input list or the tuples, so if `getKey` is not defined or if the list contains non-tuple elements, it may raise an error.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts three positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `num`, and returns a list containing `n` lists, each with `m` elements, all set to the value of `num`. This creates a 2D list (matrix) of dimensions `n x m` filled with the maximum denomination of coins, `num`. There are no checks for the values of `n`, `m`, and `num`, so if they are not positive integers, the function may not behave as expected.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three integers. It evaluates and returns the result of the expression `(x and not (x & (x - 1)))`, which checks if `x` is not empty and if `x` has only one bit set in its binary representation. However, the function does not return the list of tuples `x` itself, as stated in the annotations. The output solely depends on the logical evaluation of `x`. If `x` is empty, it returns `False`. If `x` contains valid tuples, the output is based on the evaluation of the specified expression.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. The function does not handle any edge cases since `n` is guaranteed to be within the specified range.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts a list of tuples `n`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns a flattened list of integers formed by converting the entire list of tuples into a string and then back to integers, resulting in a single list of digits rather than individual integers from the tuples. This could lead to unexpected results if the tuples contain multi-digit integers.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and an integer `r`, and returns the value of `n` choose `r`, calculated as `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))`. However, it does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would result in incorrect behavior or a mathematical error, as the combination is undefined in such cases. It also does not validate the input values or check for potential overflow in factorial calculations.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of universities and a list `y` of tuples. It returns the integer result of dividing `x` by the length of `y`. If `x` is not evenly divisible by the length of `y`, it adds 1 to the result, effectively rounding up the division. However, the code incorrectly attempts to use `y` directly in the division condition instead of `len(y)`, which could lead to an error if `y` is not treated as the length of the list. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `y` is empty, which would lead to a division by zero error.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts three positive integers `x`, `y`, and `p`, and computes `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. The function returns the result of this computation, which can vary based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `p`. If `y` is 0, it will always return 1 since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts a list of integers `x` and an integer `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the last element of the list `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, it simply returns the last element of the list `x`. However, the function does not utilize the rest of the integers in the list `x`, which may be relevant based on the problem context. If `y` is negative or not an integer, the behavior of the function is undefined based on the provided code.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts a list of tuples `n`, where each tuple contains three integers. It checks the length of the list and returns `False` if the length is less than or equal to 1, and `True` if the length is less than or equal to 3. If the length is greater than 3, it checks if the length is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if so. It then performs a check for prime conditions on the length of the list using a while loop, returning `False` if it finds any factors, and `True` otherwise. However, it does not properly handle cases where the length of the list is exactly 0 or 1, as those conditions are not explicitly checked in the code.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function sets up input and output redirection to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. It is designed to process data related to a specified number of universities, but the actual processing logic for the universities (using parameters `ni`, `li`, and `ri`) is not implemented in the provided code. There is no return value or further logic beyond setting up the I/O redirection.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        (n, l, r) = func_3()
        low = 1

            func_20('Yes')
        else:
            func_20('No')
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function processes a number of universities, each defined by parameters n, l, and r. For each university, it determines if there exists a positive integer mid such that the product of l and mid is less than or equal to n and the product of r and mid is greater than or equal to n. If such a mid is found for any university, the function calls func_20 with 'Yes'; otherwise, it calls func_20 with 'No'. It accepts no parameters directly but relies on external function calls to obtain the necessary values.

 Output decription for function20:  The function accepts variable arguments and keyword arguments, printing the string representations of the arguments to a specified file or standard output, separated by a specified separator.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
