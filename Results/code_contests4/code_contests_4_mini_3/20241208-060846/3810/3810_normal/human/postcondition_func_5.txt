The function `func_6` initializes a new thread that runs the `main` function. It accepts no parameters and does not return any value. The code suggests that it is designed to handle a scenario involving a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of universities, but the actual implementation of how this integer is used is not present within the function. Therefore, the function's current implementation does not handle or process the integer `t` or the associated parameters `ni`, `li`, and `ri`.
