The function accepts a list of integers `x` and an integer `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the last element of the list `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, it simply returns the last element of the list `x`. However, the function does not utilize the rest of the integers in the list `x`, which may be relevant based on the problem context. If `y` is negative or not an integer, the behavior of the function is undefined based on the provided code.
