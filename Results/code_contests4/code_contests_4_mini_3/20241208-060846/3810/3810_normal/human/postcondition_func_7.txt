The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key function `getKey`. There are no checks for the validity of the input list or the tuples, so if `getKey` is not defined or if the list contains non-tuple elements, it may raise an error.
