The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 1; `t` is a positive integer; `mid` is 500000000; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3(); y` is `r * 500000000`; `x` is a value such that `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
