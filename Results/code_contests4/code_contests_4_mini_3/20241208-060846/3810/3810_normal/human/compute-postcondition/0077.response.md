The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 1000000000 or 749999999; `mid` is either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` but cannot be determined without `r`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
