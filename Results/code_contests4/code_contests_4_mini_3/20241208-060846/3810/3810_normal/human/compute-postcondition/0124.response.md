The statement `high = mid - 1` assigns the value of `mid - 1` to `high`. The previous value of `mid` can be either 750000000 or 249999999. Therefore, the new value of `high` will be either 749999999 or 249999998. The states of the other variables (`low`, `y`, `f`, and the condition involving `x` and `n`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 749999999 or 249999998; `mid` is either 750000000 or 249999999; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
