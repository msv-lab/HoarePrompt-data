The value of `mid` is assigned the result of the expression `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000, the calculation is as follows:

```
mid = (1 + 1000000000) // 2
mid = 1000000001 // 2
mid = 500000000
```

The values of the other variables (`f`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 0; `t` is a positive integer; `mid` is 500000000; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**.
