The code assigns the value `1` to `f`, which changes its previous value from `0` to `1`. The other variables (`low`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `y`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is `l * 500000000`; `y` is `r * 500000000`; `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is `l * 500000000`; `y` is `r * 500000000`; `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`.**
