`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. The values of `low` and `high` are 750000001 and 1000000000 respectively. Calculating this, we get:

```
mid = (750000001 + 1000000000) // 2
mid = 1750000001 // 2
mid = 875000000
```

Therefore, after execution, the new value of `mid` is 875000000. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `y` is less than `n`, `low` is 750000001, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 875000000**
