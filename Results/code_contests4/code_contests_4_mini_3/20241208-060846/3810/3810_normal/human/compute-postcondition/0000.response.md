Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of universities (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), and for each university, `ni`, `li`, and `ri` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `ni`, `li`, `ri` ≤ 10^9 and `li` ≤ `ri`. The code prints values to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default, but no specific values have been provided to print.**
