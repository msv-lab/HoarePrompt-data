Postcondition: ***`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition. If `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, and `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from `func_3()`, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'Yes'. If `f` is 0, `t` is still a positive integer, and `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from `func_3()`, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'No'.***
