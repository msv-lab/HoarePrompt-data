The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. The value of `mid` is 875000000, but the value of `r` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot calculate a specific value for `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `y` is `r * 875000000`, `low` is 750000001, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 875000000, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid**
