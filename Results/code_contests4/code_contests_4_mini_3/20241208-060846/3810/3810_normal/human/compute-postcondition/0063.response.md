`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. The values of `low` and `high` are 500000001 and 1000000000, respectively. Calculating `mid` gives us:

```
mid = (500000001 + 1000000000) // 2
mid = 1500000001 // 2
mid = 750000000
```

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, and `mid` is 750000000.

Output State: **`low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, and `mid` is 750000000**.
