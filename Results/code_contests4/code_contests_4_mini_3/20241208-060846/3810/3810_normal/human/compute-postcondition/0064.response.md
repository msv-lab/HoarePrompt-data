The variable `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. However, the value of `l` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the value of `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 750000000, and `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`, where `l` is undefined.

Output State: **`low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 750000000, and `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`, where `l` is undefined.**
