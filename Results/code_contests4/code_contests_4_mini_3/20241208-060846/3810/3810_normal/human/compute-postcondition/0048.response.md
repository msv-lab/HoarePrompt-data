The variable `f` is assigned the value `0`, which overrides its previous value of either `1` or `0`. The other variables (`low`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `high`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `f` is 0, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `f` is 0, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000.**
