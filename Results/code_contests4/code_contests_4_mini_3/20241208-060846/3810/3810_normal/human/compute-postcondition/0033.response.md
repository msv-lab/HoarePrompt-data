The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `y` is `r * 875000000`, `low` is 750000001, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 875000000, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`, `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
