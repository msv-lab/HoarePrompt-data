Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `y` is dependent on an undefined variable `r`. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
