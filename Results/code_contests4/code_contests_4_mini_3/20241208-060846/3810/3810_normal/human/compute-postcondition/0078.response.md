Postcondition: ***`low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 1000000000 or 749999999; `mid` is either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` but cannot be determined without `r`. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
