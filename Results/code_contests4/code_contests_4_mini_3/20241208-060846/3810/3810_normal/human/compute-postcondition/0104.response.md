The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is 500000000, this results in `high` being 499999999. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `mid` is 500000000, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3`, and `y` is `r * 500000000` where the value of `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `mid` is 500000000, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3`, and `y` is `r * 500000000` where the value of `y` is greater than or equal to `n.**
