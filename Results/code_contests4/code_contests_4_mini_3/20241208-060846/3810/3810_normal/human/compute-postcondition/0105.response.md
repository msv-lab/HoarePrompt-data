Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1, `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `mid` is 500000000, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3`, and `y` is `r * 500000000`. If `y` is less than `n`, then `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`.***
