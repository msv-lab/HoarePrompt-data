The value of `f` is assigned the value `1`. This does not affect the other variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`, or `y`), which remain as they were. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `y` is dependent on an undefined variable `r`; `f` is 1.
