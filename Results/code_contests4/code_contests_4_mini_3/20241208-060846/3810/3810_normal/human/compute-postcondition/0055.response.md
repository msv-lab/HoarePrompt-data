The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is `l * 500000000`; `y` is `r * 500000000`; `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
