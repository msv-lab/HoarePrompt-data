Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999, and `mid` is 500000000. If `y` is less than `n`, then `low` is updated to 500000001 and `y` is less than `n`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `low` remains 1 and `y` is greater than or equal to `n.***
