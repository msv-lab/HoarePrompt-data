The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is 750000000, the calculation results in `high` being updated to 749999999. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 749999999, `mid` is 750000000, and `r` is undefined.
