The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. The variable `mid` is 750000000, but the variable `r` is undefined. Since `r` has no assigned value, `y` cannot be calculated. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 750000000, and `r` is undefined.

Output State: **`low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 750000000, and `r` is undefined.**
