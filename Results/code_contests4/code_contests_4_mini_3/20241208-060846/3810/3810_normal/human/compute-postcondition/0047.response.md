The variable `high` is assigned a constant value of `1000000000`. The values of `low`, `f`, `t`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `high`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `f` is either 1 or 0, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000.**
