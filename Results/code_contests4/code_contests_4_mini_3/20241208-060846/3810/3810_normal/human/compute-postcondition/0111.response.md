The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `y` is dependent on an undefined variable `r`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
