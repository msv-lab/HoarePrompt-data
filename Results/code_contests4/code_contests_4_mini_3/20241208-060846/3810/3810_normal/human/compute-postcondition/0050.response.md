`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000, we can calculate `mid` as follows: 

`mid = (1 + 1000000000) // 2 = 1000000001 // 2 = 500000000`.

The values of the other variables (`f`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `f` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000, and `mid` is 500000000.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `f` is 0, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000; `mid` is 500000000.**
