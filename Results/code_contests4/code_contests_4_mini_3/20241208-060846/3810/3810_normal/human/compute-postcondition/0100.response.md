Postcondition: ***`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `mid` is 500000000, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3`, and `y` is `r * 500000000`. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
