The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is 500000000, the calculation results in `high` being 500000000 - 1, which equals 499999999. The other variables (`low`, `f`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged, and their previous states are still valid.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 499999999; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is `l * 500000000`; `y` is `r * 500000000`; `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
