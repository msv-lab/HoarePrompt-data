Postcondition: ***`low` is greater than `high`. If `f` is 1, a valid `mid` was found such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, `mid` is the last computed value before the loop terminated, `t` is a positive integer, and `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3`, while `func_20` has been executed with the argument 'Yes'. If `f` is 0, no valid `mid` was found, `mid` is still the last computed value before the loop terminated, `t` is a positive integer, and `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3`, while `func_20` is called with the argument 'No'.***
