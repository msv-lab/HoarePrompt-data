Functionality: ** The function processes a number of universities, each defined by parameters n, l, and r. For each university, it determines if there exists a positive integer mid such that the product of l and mid is less than or equal to n and the product of r and mid is greater than or equal to n. If such a mid is found for any university, the function calls func_20 with 'Yes'; otherwise, it calls func_20 with 'No'. It accepts no parameters directly but relies on external function calls to obtain the necessary values. **
