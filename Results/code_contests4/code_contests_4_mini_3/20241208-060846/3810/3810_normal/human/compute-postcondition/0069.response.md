The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is 750000000, the new value of `low` will be 750000001. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 750000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 750000000, and `r` is undefined.

Output State: **`low` is 750000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 750000000, and `r` is undefined**.
