`y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. The value of `mid` can be either 750000000 or 249999999, and `r` is unknown. Therefore, the value of `y` will depend on the unknown value of `r` multiplied by either of the possible values for `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Thus, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000 or 249999999; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is unknown.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000 or 249999999; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is unknown.**
