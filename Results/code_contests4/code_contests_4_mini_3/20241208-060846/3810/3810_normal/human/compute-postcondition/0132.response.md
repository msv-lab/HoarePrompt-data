Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is either 1 or 0 depending on the conditions evaluated during all iterations, `t` is a positive integer, and `n`, `l`, `r` are the values returned by `func_3()` for the last iteration. The function `func_20` is called with 'Yes' if at least one valid `mid` was found across all iterations, otherwise it is called with 'No'.**
