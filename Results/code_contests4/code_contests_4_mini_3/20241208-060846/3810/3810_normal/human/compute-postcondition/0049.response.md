According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000. Since `low` (1) is indeed less than or equal to `high` (1000000000), the loop can execute one time without needing any adjustments.

State: **`low` is 1, `f` is 0, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000**
