The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` could be either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000, which leads to potential new values for `low` of 875000001, 750000001, or 625000001, respectively. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 1000000000 or 749999999; `mid` is either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000; `low` is either 875000001, 750000001, or 625000001.

Output State: **`low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 1000000000 or 749999999; `mid` is either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000; `low` is either 875000001, 750000001, or 625000001.**
