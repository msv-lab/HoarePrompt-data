According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. In the end of the last iteration, `low` is greater than `high`, and `f` is 1, indicating that there exists an integer `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`. The variable `t` is a positive integer, and `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000, but the specific value of `t` is not given. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count (which is determined by the number of times the loop has executed so far). Since the loop variable is represented by `_`, it is an unused variable, and we do not have the exact iteration count. However, we know that `func_1()` must return at least 1 more than the current count for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the states to be adjusted would be the return value of `func_1()` which must be greater than the current iteration count. 

State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000, `mid` is the last computed value before the loop terminated, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count.**
