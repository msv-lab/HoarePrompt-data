Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is 1 if there exists an integer `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, otherwise `f` remains 0; `t` is a positive integer; `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000; `mid` is the last computed value before the loop terminated. If no valid `mid` was found, then `low` will be greater than `high` and `f` will be 0.**
