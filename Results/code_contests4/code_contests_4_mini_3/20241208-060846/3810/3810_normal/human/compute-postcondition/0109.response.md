The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. However, the value of `r` is not defined or provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `y`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the uncertainty regarding `y` while maintaining the states of the other variables.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `y` is dependent on an undefined variable `r`.**
