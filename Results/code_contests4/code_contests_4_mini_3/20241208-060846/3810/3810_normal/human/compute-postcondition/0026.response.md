The variable `high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is 750000000, the new value of `high` will be 750000000 - 1, which is 749999999. The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state is: `t` is a positive integer, `low` is 500000001, `high` is 749999999, `mid` is 750000000, `l` is undefined, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined, and no new assignments or changes in values occur for `x`, `y`, or `f`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `low` is 500000001, `high` is 749999999, `mid` is 750000000, `l` is undefined, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**
