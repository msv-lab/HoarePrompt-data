The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` can be either 750000000 or 249999999. Therefore, `low` can either be 750000001 (if mid is 750000000) or 250000000 (if mid is 249999999). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`low` is either 750000001 or 250000000; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000 or 249999999; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
