The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. The value of `mid` is 500000000, and `r` is assigned a value from `func_3()`, which is unknown but positive. Therefore, `y` will be a positive value based on the multiplication of `r` and 500000000. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `f` is 0, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is `l * 500000000`; `y` is `r * 500000000`**
