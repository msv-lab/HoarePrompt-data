The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is 500000000, we calculate `low` as follows: `low = 500000000 + 1`, which equals `500000001`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is `l * 500000000`; `y` is `r * 500000000`; `y` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is `l * 500000000`; `y` is `r * 500000000`; `y` is less than `n`.**
