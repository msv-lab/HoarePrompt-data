The variable `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. However, the value of `l` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot compute a specific value for `x`. The values for `low`, `high`, and `mid` are also provided, but they do not affect the computation since `l` is unknown. Therefore, the output state will reflect the uncertainty regarding the value of `x`.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000 or 249999999; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`, where `l` is unknown.**
