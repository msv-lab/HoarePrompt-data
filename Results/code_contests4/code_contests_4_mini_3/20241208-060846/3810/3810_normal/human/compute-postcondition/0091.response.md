The variable `high` is assigned the value 1000000000. The previous value of `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000, but it is now explicitly set to 1000000000. The values of the other variables (`low`, `f`, `t`, `mid`, `n`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 1; `t` is a positive integer; `mid` is the last computed value before the loop terminated; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 1; `t` is a positive integer; `mid` is the last computed value before the loop terminated; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**.
