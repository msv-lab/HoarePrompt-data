The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it is designed to work with a predefined positive integer `t` representing the number of universities. For each university, it works with three positive integers: `ni`, `li`, and `ri`, where the conditions are defined as 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9 and li ≤ ri. 

The function's output is not explicitly stated, so we cannot derive specific return values or cases from the provided information. Therefore, we can conclude that the function processes the information related to a number of universities based on the given constraints but does not return any specific value as the output is not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates with a positive integer t representing the number of universities and positive integers ni, li, ri for each university, ensuring that all integers meet the specified constraints. The specific output of the function is not defined.**
