The function `func_20` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as indicated by its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of universities, and for each university, `ni`, `li`, and `ri` are positive integers with specified ranges and relationships.

The function returns a list of results based on the input data associated with the universities. Specifically, the function processes the values of `ni`, `li`, and `ri` for each university and produces output based on these values. 

Given that the function does not take arguments but relies on the defined constraints and relationships, the output will depend on the internal processing of these values, which might include counts or results relevant to the universities.

Functionality: **The function processes data related to a given number of universities and returns results based on the values associated with each university, specifically `ni`, `li`, and `ri`.**
