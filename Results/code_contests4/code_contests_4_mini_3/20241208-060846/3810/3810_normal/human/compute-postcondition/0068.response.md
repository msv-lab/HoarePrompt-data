Postcondition: ***`low` is 500000001, `f` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 750000000, and `r` is undefined. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
