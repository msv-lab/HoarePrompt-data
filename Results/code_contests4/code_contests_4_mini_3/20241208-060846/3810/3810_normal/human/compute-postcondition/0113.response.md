The value of `low` is assigned `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` can be either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000. Therefore, depending on the value of `mid`, `low` will be updated as follows:

- If `mid` is 750000000, then `low` will be 750000001.
- If `mid` is 500000000, then `low` will be 500000001.
- If `mid` is 250000000, then `low` will be 250000001.

The values of `high`, `y`, and `r` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `low` is either 750000001, 500000001, or 250000001.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `low` is either 750000001, 500000001, or 250000001.**
