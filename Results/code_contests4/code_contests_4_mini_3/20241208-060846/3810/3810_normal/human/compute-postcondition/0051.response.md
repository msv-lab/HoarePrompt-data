`x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. The value of `mid` is 500000000, and `l` has been assigned a value returned by `func_3()`, which is currently unknown. Therefore, `x` will be `l * 500000000`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`low` is 1, `f` is 0, `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3(); high` is 1000000000; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is `l * 500000000`.**
