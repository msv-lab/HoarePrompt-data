According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000, which means `low` is indeed less than `high`. Therefore, the loop can execute right away without any adjustments needed to the values of `low` or `high`.

State: **`low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 0; `t` is a positive integer; `mid` is the last computed value before the loop terminated; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**.
