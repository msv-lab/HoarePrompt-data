The value of `mid` is assigned the result of the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`. The previous values of `low` can be either 750000001 or 500000001, and `high` can be either 1000000000 or 749999999. 

Calculating for both scenarios:
1. If `low` is 750000001 and `high` is 1000000000:
   - `mid = (750000001 + 1000000000) // 2 = 875000000 // 2 = 875000000`

2. If `low` is 750000001 and `high` is 749999999:
   - This scenario is not possible because `low` cannot be greater than `high`.

3. If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is 1000000000:
   - `mid = (500000001 + 1000000000) // 2 = 1500000001 // 2 = 750000000`

4. If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is 749999999:
   - `mid = (500000001 + 749999999) // 2 = 1250000000 // 2 = 625000000`

The value of `mid` can be either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000 depending on the values of `low` and `high`. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 1000000000 or 749999999; `mid` is either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000.

Output State: **`low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 1000000000 or 749999999; `mid` is either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000.**
