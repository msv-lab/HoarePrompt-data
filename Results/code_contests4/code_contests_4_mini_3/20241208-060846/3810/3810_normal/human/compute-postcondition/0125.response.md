Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000 or 249999999; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. If `y` is less than `n`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 749999999 or 249999998; `mid` is either 750000000 or 249999999; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, and if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
