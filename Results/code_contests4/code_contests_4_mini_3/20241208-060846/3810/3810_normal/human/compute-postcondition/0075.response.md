To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we need to analyze the effect of the line `y = r * mid`. However, the variable `r` has not been defined in the initial state or provided context, which means we cannot calculate `y` definitively without knowing the value of `r`. Therefore, the output will reflect that `y` is assigned but cannot be explicitly determined.

Given that `mid` can take on several values depending on `low` and `high`, we can note the possibilities for `y` based on the potential values of `mid` and the undefined variable `r`.

Output State: **`low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 1000000000 or 749999999; `mid` is either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` but cannot be determined without `r`.**
