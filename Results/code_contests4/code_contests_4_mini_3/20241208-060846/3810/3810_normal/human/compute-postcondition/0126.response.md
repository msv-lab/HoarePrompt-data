Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is 1 if a valid `mid` was found such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, or `f` remains 0 if no such `mid` was found; `mid` is the last computed value before the loop terminated, `t` is a positive integer, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3`.**
