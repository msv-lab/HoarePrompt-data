Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000. If `y` is less than `n`, then `low` is either 750000001, 500000001, or 250000001. Otherwise, `high` is updated to either 749999999 or 499999998, while `low` remains either 500000001 or 1; `mid` is unchanged; `y` is dependent on an undefined variable `r`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
