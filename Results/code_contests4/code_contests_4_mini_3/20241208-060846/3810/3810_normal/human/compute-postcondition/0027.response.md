Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer. If `y` is less than `n`, then if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, `f` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `low` is updated to 750000001, while `high` remains 1000000000, and `mid` is 750000000. If `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `low` is set to 500000001, `high` is updated to 749999999, and `mid` remains 750000000, with `l`, `x`, and `y` still undefined.***
