Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `y` is `r * 875000000`, `low` is 750000001 or 875000001, `high` is 1000000000 or 875000000, `mid` is 875000000, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`, and if `y < n`, then if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `y >= n`, then if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
