The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. The value of `mid` is 500000000, but the value of `r` is unknown since it is assigned from the `func_3()` return. Therefore, the output state reflects that `y` is dependent on the unknown value of `r`. 

Since `r` is not specified, we cannot provide a concrete value for `y`. However, the relationship is established.

Output State: **`low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 0; `t` is a positive integer; `mid` is 500000000; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3(); y` is `r * 500000000`.**
