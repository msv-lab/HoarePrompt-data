According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns a value greater than the current iteration count, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is greater than `high`, and the state of `f`, `t`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remains unchanged from when `func_3()` was called. 

Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly tracked, it is assumed to increment by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value that is at least one greater than the current value of `_` (which is the number of completed iterations).

State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition, `t` is a positive integer, and for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count.**
