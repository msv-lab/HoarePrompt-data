Postcondition: ***`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is 1 if there exists an integer `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, otherwise `f` is 0. The variable `t` is a positive integer, `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000, and `mid` is the last computed value before the loop terminated. If `f` is true, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'Yes', otherwise, `func_20` is called with the argument 'No'.***
