Postcondition: ***`low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 1000000000 or 749999999; `mid` is either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000. If `y < n`, then `low` is updated to either 875000001, 750000001, or 625000001. Otherwise, `low` is either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` is either 874999999, 749999999, or 624999999; `mid` remains either 875000000, 750000000, or 625000000; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` but cannot be determined without `r`; `f` remains unchanged.***
