Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `y` is `r * 875000000`, `low` is 750000001, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 875000000, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`, if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
