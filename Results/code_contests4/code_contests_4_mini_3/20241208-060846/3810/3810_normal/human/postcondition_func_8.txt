The function accepts three positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `num`, and returns a list containing `n` lists, each with `m` elements, all set to the value of `num`. This creates a 2D list (matrix) of dimensions `n x m` filled with the maximum denomination of coins, `num`. There are no checks for the values of `n`, `m`, and `num`, so if they are not positive integers, the function may not behave as expected.
