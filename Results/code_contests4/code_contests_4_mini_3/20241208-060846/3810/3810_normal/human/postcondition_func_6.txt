The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the second tuple in the list, which includes three integers (n1, l1, r1) that satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ n1, l1, r1 ≤ 10^9 and l1 ≤ r1. If the list contains fewer than two tuples, the function will raise an IndexError.
