The function sets up input and output redirection to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. It is designed to process data related to a specified number of universities, but the actual processing logic for the universities (using parameters `ni`, `li`, and `ri`) is not implemented in the provided code. There is no return value or further logic beyond setting up the I/O redirection.
