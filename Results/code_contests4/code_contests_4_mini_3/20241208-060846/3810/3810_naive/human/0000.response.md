To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly identifies if Alexey can gather the exact donation amount using the specified coin denominations.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
- For each university, Alexey has to pay an exact amount `ni` using coins with denominations ranging from `li` to `ri`.
- He can use coins of any denomination within that range any number of times.

### Key Conditions:
1. The exact amount `ni` must be reachable using a combination of coins of denominations between `li` and `ri`.
2. If the minimum denomination `li` multiplied by some integer `k` can reach or exceed `ni`, and the maximum denomination `ri` multiplied by `k` can also reach or exceed `ni`, then it should be possible to pay `ni`. 

### Code Analysis:
The code attempts to solve this by using a binary search approach to check if `ni` can be formed with denominations between `li` and `ri`. It calculates a range by checking multiples of `li` and `ri`.

### Potential Issues:
- The algorithm's logic for determining whether a valid combination of coins can yield `ni` is flawed. Specifically, it only checks the multiples of `li` and `ri` rather than testing combinations of denominations that could sum to `ni`.
- For instance, if `ni` is less than `li`, Alexey cannot make the payment, but the code does not explicitly handle this case effectively.
- Furthermore, if `li` and `ri` are equal and do not divide `ni`, the code would incorrectly return "Yes".

### Example Test Case:
Let's consider a case:
- Input: `ni = 5`, `li = 3`, `ri = 3`.
- The only coin denomination available is `3`. However, `5` cannot be formed using just `3`s. The output should be "No", but the provided code may incorrectly output "Yes" if it misinterprets the range checks.

### Conclusion:
Since the logic of the program does not correctly account for all scenarios where the exact amount cannot be made and may yield incorrect results based on the described conditions, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
