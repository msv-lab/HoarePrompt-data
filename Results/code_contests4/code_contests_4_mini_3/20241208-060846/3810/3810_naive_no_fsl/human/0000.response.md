To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented can correctly handle all possible cases described.

### Problem Analysis
Alexey has to pay a donation `n_i` using coins in the range `[l_i, r_i]`. The goal is to check if it is possible to sum up to `n_i` using any combination of coins where each coin's denomination lies within the specified range.

### Key Observations
1. **Basic Feasibility**: If `n_i` is less than the minimum denomination `l_i`, then it's impossible to pay that donation. Similarly, if `n_i` is greater than the maximum possible sum using the maximum denomination `r_i`, it is also impossible.
2. **Combination of Coins**: The problem can be reduced to checking whether `n_i` can be represented as a combination of coins in the range `[l_i, r_i]`.

### Implementation Check
The function `func_19()` processes the input and uses a binary search approach to determine if it can generate the amount `n_i` using multiples of the denominations `l_i` to `r_i`. However, a more straightforward approach can be used based on the following logic:
- The minimum amount that can be formed is `l_i * k` for some integer `k`.
- The maximum amount that can be formed is `r_i * k` for the same integer `k`.
- If there exists any integer `k` such that `n_i` falls between `l_i * k` and `r_i * k`, we can pay the donation.

### Edge Cases
1. If `n_i` is exactly equal to `l_i`, the answer should be "Yes" since one coin of denomination `l_i` can be used.
2. If `n_i` is less than `l_i`, the answer should be "No".
3. If `n_i` is exactly equal to `r_i`, the answer should also be "Yes".

### Potential Failing Case
The provided implementation may fail when:
- `l_i` is greater than `n_i` (it should return "No").
- The implementation might not correctly handle cases where `l_i` and `r_i` are the same and do not divide `n_i`.

### Example Input That Might Fail
Given the values:
- `n_i = 7`, `l_i = 3`, `r_i = 3`
The expected output should be "No" since `7` cannot be formed using only coins of `3`. However, the binary search logic might produce an incorrect answer.

### Conclusion
Based on this analysis, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
