#State of the program right berfore the function call: The first input is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).
def func_1(result):

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The first input is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos; `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000); the first element of `result` is true; all elements of `result[1]` have been printed, and `result[1]` is now fully iterated.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The first input is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). If the first element of `result` is true, all elements of `result[1]` have been printed and `result[1]` is fully iterated. Otherwise, if the first element of `result` is false, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `result`, where the first element is a boolean indicating whether weights are available, and the second element is a list of weights. If the first element is true, it prints 'YES' followed by each weight from the list; if false, it prints 'NO'. The integer `m` is not utilized within the function, and thus does not affect its behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, where the i-th character indicates the availability of i-kilo weights; w is an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000).
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns the boolean value True and the string 'l' which is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of i-kilo weights.
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's with at least one '1'; `w` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `i` is 10; `tmp` is the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`, which is the final result of the last iteration, either returning (True, some_value) or (False, some_value).
        return False,
        #The program returns False, indicating that the condition checked within the function was not met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `l` of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's (indicating the availability of weights), an integer `w` (total number of weights to be placed on the scales within the range of 1 to 1000), and an integer `m`. It checks if the length of `l` matches `m`. If it does, it returns `True` along with the string `l`. If not, it enters a loop that attempts to recursively call itself with an updated version of `l` (which is incorrectly modified as a list instead of remaining a string). If any recursive call returns `True`, it will return `True` with the second value of that call. If none of the recursive calls succeed, it returns `False`. The function's logic may not work correctly due to the type mismatch when updating `l`. Additionally, if `m` is greater than 10, the function will always return `False`, which is not explicitly noted in the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and weights is a positive integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales.
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns a list of weights that are greater than the absolute difference `tmp` between the sum of characters at even indices and the sum of characters at odd indices, and not equal to the last character of the string `seq`.
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the variable 'weights', which is empty since 'seq' indicates there are no available weights (all characters are '0').
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `seq` of exactly ten characters representing the availability of weights (where '0' means unavailable and '1' means available) and a list of positive integers `weights`. It calculates the absolute difference between the sum of characters at even indices and the sum at odd indices of `seq`. If `seq` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one '1'), it returns a list of weights from `weights` that are greater than this calculated difference and not equal to the last character of `seq` (interpreted as an integer). If `seq` consists entirely of '0's, it returns the original list of `weights`, which may be empty. The function does not handle cases where `weights` is not a list or contains values that cannot be compared to the computed difference.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a string of exactly ten characters, each either '0' or '1', representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string of exactly ten characters, `m` is a positive integer (1 <= m <= 1000), `result` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all characters in `w` that are '1'.
    return result
    #The program returns the list containing the 1-based indices of all characters in the string 'w' that are '1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `w` of exactly ten characters, each being either '0' or '1', and returns a list of 1-based indices indicating the positions in `w` where the character is '1'. There are no edge cases handled since `w` is always expected to have exactly ten characters.
