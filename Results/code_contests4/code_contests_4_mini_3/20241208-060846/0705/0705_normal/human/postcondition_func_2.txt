The function accepts a string `seq` of exactly ten characters representing the availability of weights (where '0' means unavailable and '1' means available) and a list of positive integers `weights`. It calculates the absolute difference between the sum of characters at even indices and the sum at odd indices of `seq`. If `seq` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one '1'), it returns a list of weights from `weights` that are greater than this calculated difference and not equal to the last character of `seq` (interpreted as an integer). If `seq` consists entirely of '0's, it returns the original list of `weights`, which may be empty. The function does not handle cases where `weights` is not a list or contains values that cannot be compared to the computed difference.
