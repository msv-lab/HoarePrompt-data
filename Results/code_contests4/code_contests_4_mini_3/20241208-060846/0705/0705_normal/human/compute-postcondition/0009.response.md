`result` is modified to include the current value of `i`, which is 3. The previous values of the variables indicate that `result` was [1, 2] before this operation. After executing `result.append(i)`, the new value of `result` will be [1, 2, 3]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string of exactly ten characters, `m` is a positive integer (1 <= m <= 1000), `result` is [1, 2, 3], `i` is 3.

Output State: **`w` is a string of exactly ten characters, `m` is a positive integer (1 <= m <= 1000), `result` is [1, 2, 3], `i` is 3**
