According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the length of the string `w`. The loop starts with `i` at 2 and will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to the length of `w`, which is 10. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `w` is a string of exactly ten characters, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` becomes 3, and the length of `w` remains 10.

State: **`w` is a string of exactly ten characters, `m` is a positive integer (1 <= m <= 1000), `result` is [1, 2], `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `len(w)` must be 10.**
