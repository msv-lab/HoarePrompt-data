The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `w`, and `m`. 

- `l` is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, indicating the availability of i-kilo weights.
- `w` is an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales, constrained to the range 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000.
- `m` is an additional integer parameter whose constraints are not specified.

The function has multiple return cases:

- **Case 1**: The function returns the boolean value `True` and the string `l`.
  
- **Case 2**: The function returns `True` and the second element of a non-empty iterable `tmp`, derived from a call to `func_2` with parameters `l`, `w`, and `m`, where the first element of `tmp` is truthy.

- **Case 3**: The function returns `True` and the second element of the tuple `tmp`, derived from calling `func_2` with a list formed by concatenating `l` and the integer `[i]`, along with `w`.

- **Case 4**: The function returns a tuple with `True` and the second element of the result from `func_2` using the modified string `l` (which is `l` concatenated with the integer `[i]`) and `w`, where `tmp[1]` is the second element of that result.

- **Case 5**: The function returns `False`, indicating that a specific condition checked within the function was not met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `l`, an integer `w`, and an integer `m`, and return various results based on the conditions met during execution, including a boolean value and elements derived from additional calls to itself. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l` (a string of ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's), `w` (an integer between 1 and 1000), and `m` (an integer), and returns various outputs including a boolean value and elements from derived calls based on specific conditions.**
