The value of `i` is appended to the list `result`. Since `i` is 2, the list `result` will now contain the additional value 2. The previous value of `result` was [1], so after the execution, `result` will be [1, 2]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is a string of exactly ten characters, `m` is a positive integer (1 <= m <= 1000), `result` is [1, 2], `i` is 2**
