The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `w`. `w` is a string of exactly ten characters, each either '0' or '1', representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing the 1-based indices of all characters in the string `w` that are '1'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a string `w` and return a list of indices where the weights are available.
