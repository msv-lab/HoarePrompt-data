You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: l is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, where the i-th character indicates the availability of i-kilo weights; w is an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000).
```
def func_2(l, w, m):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns the boolean value True and the string 'l' which is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of i-kilo weights.

Case_2: The program returns True and the second element of the non-empty iterable 'tmp', which is derived from the function func_2 with parameters 'l' (a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's with at least one '1'), 'w' (an integer between 1 and 1000), and 'm', where the first element of 'tmp' is truthy.

Case_3: The program returns True and the second element of the tuple 'tmp' that is derived from the function 'func_2' using the list formed by concatenating the string 'l' and the integer [i], along with 'w'.

Case_4: The program returns a tuple with True and the second element of the result from func_2 using the modified string 'l' (which is 'l' concatenated with the integer [i]) and the integer 'w', where 'tmp[1]' is the second element of that result.

Case_5: The program returns False, indicating that the condition checked within the function was not met.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
