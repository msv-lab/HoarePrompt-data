Postcondition: ***`l` is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's with at least one '1', `w` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` is 2. If `tmp[0]` is True, the function returns a tuple with True and the second element of the result from `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`, where `tmp[1]` is the second element of that result. There is no else part in the code.***
