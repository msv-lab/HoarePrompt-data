You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales. Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos. Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little. For this, she puts weights on the scalepans, one by one. The first weight goes on the left scalepan, the second weight goes on the right scalepan, the third one goes on the left scalepan, the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on. Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepans.

Simply putting weights on the scales is not interesting, so Xenia has set some rules. First, she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight. That is, the weight that goes i-th should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight for any i (1 ≤ i < m). Second, every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan, she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one. That is, the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan.

You are given all types of weights available for Xenia. You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type. Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on ​​the scales or to say that it can't be done.

Input

The first line contains a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones: the i-th (i ≥ 1) character in the line equals "1" if Xenia has i kilo weights, otherwise the character equals "0". The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Output

In the first line print "YES", if there is a way to put m weights on the scales by all rules. Otherwise, print in the first line "NO". If you can put m weights on the scales, then print in the next line m integers — the weights' weights in the order you put them on the scales.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The first input is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).
def func_1(result):
    if result[0] :
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            print(i),
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The first input is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos; `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000); the first element of `result` is true; all elements of `result[1]` have been printed, and `result[1]` is now fully iterated.
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The first input is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). If the first element of `result` is true, all elements of `result[1]` have been printed and `result[1]` is fully iterated. Otherwise, if the first element of `result` is false, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `result`, where the first element is a boolean indicating whether weights are available, and the second element is a list of weights. If the first element is true, it prints 'YES' followed by each weight from the list; if false, it prints 'NO'. The integer `m` is not utilized within the function, and thus does not affect its behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, where the i-th character indicates the availability of i-kilo weights; w is an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000).
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns the boolean value True and the string 'l' which is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of i-kilo weights.
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's with at least one '1'; `w` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `i` is 10; `tmp` is the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`, which is the final result of the last iteration, either returning (True, some_value) or (False, some_value).
        return False,
        #The program returns False, indicating that the condition checked within the function was not met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `l` of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's (indicating the availability of weights), an integer `w` (total number of weights to be placed on the scales within the range of 1 to 1000), and an integer `m`. It checks if the length of `l` matches `m`. If it does, it returns `True` along with the string `l`. If not, it enters a loop that attempts to recursively call itself with an updated version of `l` (which is incorrectly modified as a list instead of remaining a string). If any recursive call returns `True`, it will return `True` with the second value of that call. If none of the recursive calls succeed, it returns `False`. The function's logic may not work correctly due to the type mismatch when updating `l`. Additionally, if `m` is greater than 10, the function will always return `False`, which is not explicitly noted in the annotations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and weights is a positive integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales.
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns a list of weights that are greater than the absolute difference `tmp` between the sum of characters at even indices and the sum of characters at odd indices, and not equal to the last character of the string `seq`.
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the variable 'weights', which is empty since 'seq' indicates there are no available weights (all characters are '0').
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `seq` of exactly ten characters representing the availability of weights (where '0' means unavailable and '1' means available) and a list of positive integers `weights`. It calculates the absolute difference between the sum of characters at even indices and the sum at odd indices of `seq`. If `seq` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one '1'), it returns a list of weights from `weights` that are greater than this calculated difference and not equal to the last character of `seq` (interpreted as an integer). If `seq` consists entirely of '0's, it returns the original list of `weights`, which may be empty. The function does not handle cases where `weights` is not a list or contains values that cannot be compared to the computed difference.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a string of exactly ten characters, each either '0' or '1', representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string of exactly ten characters, `m` is a positive integer (1 <= m <= 1000), `result` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all characters in `w` that are '1'.
    return result
    #The program returns the list containing the 1-based indices of all characters in the string 'w' that are '1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `w` of exactly ten characters, each being either '0' or '1', and returns a list of 1-based indices indicating the positions in `w` where the character is '1'. There are no edge cases handled since `w` is always expected to have exactly ten characters.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
