Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails to meet the problem description:

1. **Weight Placement Logic**: The program does not ensure that weights are placed alternately on the left and right pans as specified in the problem description. The logic for alternating weights is not present in the given functions, which leads to an incorrect way of placing weights.

2. **Consecutive Weights Check**: The requirement states that no two consecutive weights can have the same weight. However, the program does not enforce this rule when generating the list of weights to be placed on the scales.

3. **Strict Outweigh Requirement**: The program should ensure that the sum of weights on one pan is strictly greater than the sum of weights on the other pan after each weight placement. It lacks the necessary checks to maintain this condition throughout the placing of weights.

4. **Handling of Inputs**: The function `func_2` checks if the length of `l` is equal to `m`, which does not correspond to the logic of the problem. The function should be generating weights based on the availability indicated by the input string and how many weights need to be placed.

5. **Return Values and Outputs**: The output format specified in the problem description requires weights to be printed following "YES" if it is possible to place them, but the program seems to have a convoluted way of returning results, and it does not clearly output the weights in the required manner.

Because of these issues, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements as outlined, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
