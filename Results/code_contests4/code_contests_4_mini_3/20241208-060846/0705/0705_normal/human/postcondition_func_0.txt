The function accepts a tuple `result`, where the first element is a boolean indicating whether weights are available, and the second element is a list of weights. If the first element is true, it prints 'YES' followed by each weight from the list; if false, it prints 'NO'. The integer `m` is not utilized within the function, and thus does not affect its behavior.
