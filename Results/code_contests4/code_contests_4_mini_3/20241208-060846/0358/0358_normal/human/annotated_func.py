#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000. The input consists of a list of log entries in the format "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE", where each date and time is valid according to the specified format, and the log entries are provided in chronological order.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    log = sys.stdin.readlines()
    logtime = []
    last = 0
    for line in log:
        a = line.find(' ')
        
        year, month, day = map(int, line[:a].split('-'))
        
        b = line.rfind(':')
        
        hour, minute, second = map(int, line[a:b].split(':'))
        
        now = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
        
        logtime.append(now)
        
        print(line[:b], last)
        
        for x in logtime[last:]:
            delta = int((now - x).total_seconds())
            print(delta)
            if delta >= n:
                last += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if len(logtime) - last >= m:
            print(line[:b])
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the last processed log line; `now` is a datetime object representing the last log entry time; `logtime` contains all datetime objects parsed from the log lines; `last` is the index of the first element in `logtime` for which the difference in seconds from `now` is less than `n`, or equals the length of `logtime` if all elements satisfy the condition; if the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program outputs the substring of the last log line up to index `b`, otherwise it outputs -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of chronological log entries, each formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE". It reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, where `n` specifies the time threshold in seconds, and `m` specifies the minimum number of log entries that must be present within that time period. The function checks if there are at least `m` log entries that occurred within `n` seconds of the most recent log entry. If so, it prints the timestamp of the last log entry; otherwise, it does not return anything explicitly, which could imply an implicit return of None. The function does not handle cases where there are insufficient log entries to meet the criteria and may not account for empty input scenarios, potentially leading to runtime errors.
