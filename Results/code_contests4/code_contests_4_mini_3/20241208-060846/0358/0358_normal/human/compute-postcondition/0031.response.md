Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the time in `line`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the `now` datetime object; `last` is increased by 1; `delta` is assigned the value of the total seconds difference between `now` and `x`; `delta` is printed. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the above steps are executed. In the case where `delta` is less than `n`, the same steps are executed, but we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
