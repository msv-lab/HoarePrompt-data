The code assigns values to `hour`, `minute`, and `second` by splitting the substring of `line` from index `a` to index `b` using the ':' character as a delimiter and mapping the resulting string components to integers. The substring is expected to contain a time in the format "hour:minute:second". The values of `hour`, `minute`, and `second` will now reflect the parsed integer values from this substring. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned integer values parsed from the substring of `line` between indices `a` and `b`, split by ':'**
