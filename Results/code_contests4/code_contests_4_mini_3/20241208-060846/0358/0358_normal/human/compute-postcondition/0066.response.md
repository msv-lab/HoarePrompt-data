Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the substring of `line`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the `now` datetime object; `logtime` has at least `last` elements; `last` is incremented by the number of elements in `logtime` where the total seconds between `now` and those elements are greater than or equal to `n`; if no such elements exist, `last` remains unchanged; the difference between the length of `logtime` and `last` is greater than or equal to `m`.***
