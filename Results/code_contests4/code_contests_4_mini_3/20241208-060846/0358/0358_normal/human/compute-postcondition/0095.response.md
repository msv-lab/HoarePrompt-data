The value of `last` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `last` is unknown. The variable `delta` remains unchanged as it is not impacted by the execution of the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `delta` is the integer value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`; `last` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`delta` is the integer value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`; `last` is increased by 1**
