The code initializes an empty list `logtime`. The variables `n` and `m` retain their previous values as input integers, and the list `log` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the new assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are input integers, and `logtime` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers; `logtime` is an empty list.**
