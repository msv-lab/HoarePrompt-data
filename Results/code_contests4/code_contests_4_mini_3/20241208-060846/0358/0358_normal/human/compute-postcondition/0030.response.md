The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the time in `line`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the `now` datetime object; `last` is increased by 1; `delta` is assigned the value of the total seconds difference between `now` and `x`; `delta` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
