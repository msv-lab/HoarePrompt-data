Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the substring of `line`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the `now` datetime object; `logtime` has at least `last + 2` elements; `x` is the element at index `last + 1`; `delta` is calculated as the integer value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
