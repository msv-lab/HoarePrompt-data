Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the time in `line`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the `now` datetime object; `last` is the index of the first element in `logtime` for which the difference in seconds from `now` is less than `n` or `last` equals the length of `logtime` if all elements satisfy the condition. If the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, the output is the substring of `line` up to index `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
