Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned integer values; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` has at least `last` elements; `last` is the number of elements in `logtime` that have a time difference of at least `n` seconds from `now`; `delta` is the total seconds between `now` and the last `x` processed in the loop. If the difference between the length of `logtime` and `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `output` is set to the first `b` characters of `line` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
