Postcondition: ***`delta` is the integer value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the variable `last` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `delta` is updated to the integer value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
