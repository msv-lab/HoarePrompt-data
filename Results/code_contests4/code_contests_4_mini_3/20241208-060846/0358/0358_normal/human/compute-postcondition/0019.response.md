Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the time in `line`, `now` is a datetime object, and `logtime` includes the `now` datetime object. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1 and `x` is updated to the element in `logtime` at the new index. If `delta` is less than `n`, `last` remains less than the length of `logtime`, `x` is the element in `logtime` at index `last`, and `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())` which is less than `n`, resulting in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
