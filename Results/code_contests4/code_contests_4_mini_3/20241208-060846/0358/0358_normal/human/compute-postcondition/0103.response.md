Output State: **`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the last processed log line; `now` is a datetime object representing the last log entry time; `logtime` contains all datetime objects parsed from the log lines; `last` is the index of the first element in `logtime` for which the difference in seconds from `now` is less than `n`, or equals the length of `logtime` if all elements satisfy the condition; if the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program outputs the substring of the last log line up to index `b`, otherwise it outputs -1.**
