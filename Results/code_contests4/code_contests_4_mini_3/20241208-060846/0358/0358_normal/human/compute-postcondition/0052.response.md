Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the substring of `line`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the `now` datetime object; `logtime` has at least `last` elements; `x` is the element at index `last`; if `delta`, the total seconds between `now` and `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `delta` is less than `n`, leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
