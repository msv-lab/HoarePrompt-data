Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from the time in `line`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the `now` datetime object; `last` is less than the length of `logtime`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `delta` is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
