Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned integer values; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` has at least `last + 1` elements; `delta` is the total seconds between `now` and `x` and is printed. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `delta` is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
