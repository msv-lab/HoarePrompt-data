Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral using the given points. The main issue lies in how the area is computed and the logic for selecting points.

1. The `func_1` function calculates the area of a triangle given three points, but the program attempts to use this function to calculate the area of a quadrilateral by only iterating through pairs of points and a single other point for area calculations. This approach does not account for the fact that a quadrilateral requires four points, and the logic does not ensure that the selected points can form a valid quadrilateral.

2. The code only considers pairs of points (i, j) and one additional point (z) to calculate the area, which is insufficient to determine the maximum area of a quadrilateral formed by four points. The program fails to iterate through all combinations of four points, which is necessary to find the correct maximal area.

To illustrate this with an example: consider the points (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), and (4,4). The program does not exhaustively check all combinations of four points, which could lead to missing the maximum area case entirely.

Thus, the program is incomplete and does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
