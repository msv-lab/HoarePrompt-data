To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral formed by four points selected from a given set of points in the Cartesian plane. Each set of points is guaranteed to be distinct, and no three points are collinear.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the coordinates of points. This part seems to be correct.
   
2. **Area Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the area of a triangle formed by three points. The formula used is correct, but the area is returned as a half value. The area of a quadrilateral formed by four points can be calculated by dividing it into two triangles (which the program does indirectly).

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The program iterates through all pairs of points `(i, j)` to consider them as two vertices of the quadrilateral.
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, it calculates the area formed with every other point `z` in the list. 
   - It tracks the maximum area encountered in two parts (maxx1 for positive area triangles and maxx2 for negative area triangles).

4. **Max Area Calculation**: The condition to update `maxx` seems to be based on the maximum areas found from the combinations of the triangles formed. 

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect Area Calculation**: The area calculation is done for triangles formed by a pair of points and one other point, but it does not account for the fourth point in the quadrilateral. Thus, it may not explore all combinations of four points adequately.

2. **Inefficiency**: The algorithm does not efficiently calculate the area of quadrilaterals directly by choosing four points. Instead, it relies on combinations of triangles, which may lead to overlooking valid quadrilaterals.

3. **Specific Test Case**: 
   - Consider a scenario with points forming a rectangle or a square, which is the simplest case to analyze.
     - Input: 
       ```
       4
       0 0
       0 4
       4 0
       4 4
       ```
     - The expected maximal area for these points is `16`, as they form a square. However, the logic might fail to capture the area correctly as it only looks at pairs and does not calculate the area for combinations of four points directly.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, particularly that the program does not correctly compute the area of a quadrilateral formed by four selected points, the correctness of the program is questionable.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to calculate the maximal area of a quadrilateral accurately, particularly in cases where points form a simple shape like a rectangle or square.
