Correctness: **False**

The provided program only defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a triangle given three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3). However, the problem description requires calculating the maximal area of a special quadrilateral formed by four points from a given set of special points. 

The key issues are:
1. The function `func_1` is limited to calculating the area of a triangle, not a quadrilateral.
2. The program does not consider all combinations of four points to determine the maximal area quadrilateral.
3. There is no implementation to read the input of multiple points or to calculate the areas of quadrilaterals formed by four points.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the maximal area of a quadrilateral formed by four points. The logic for selecting four points and computing their area is missing.

In summary, the program fails to address the requirements of the problem statement, leading to a conclusion that it is incorrect.
