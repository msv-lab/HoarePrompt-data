Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem requires calculating the maximal area of a quadrilateral formed by four points from a set of special points, while the annotated program only calculates the area of a triangle formed by three specific points.

1. **Quadrilateral vs Triangle**: The problem explicitly asks for the area of a quadrilateral, which consists of four vertices. However, the function `func_1` takes only six parameters, which represent the coordinates of three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), x3, y3). This indicates that the function cannot compute the area of a quadrilateral, as it is limited to triangles.

2. **Maximal Area Calculation**: The problem demands the computation of the maximal area of a special quadrilateral from a set of points. The given function does not attempt to evaluate combinations of four points or compute areas in that context. It only computes the area of a triangle formed by three points, which does not align with the requirement of finding a quadrilateral.

3. **Failure to Handle All Inputs**: The function also does not handle the input conditions of multiple points, as it is designed only for three points. The lack of logic to iterate through combinations of four points from the input set means it cannot achieve the task specified in the problem.

In conclusion, the program lacks the necessary logic and implementation to meet the task's requirements, which is why it is deemed incorrect.
