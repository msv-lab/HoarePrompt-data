The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y3`. Each of these parameters is an integer, with the coordinates constrained within -1000 to 1000 and ensuring that no three points are collinear or two points identical. The function calculates the area of a triangle formed by the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) using a specific formula. It then returns half of the calculated area. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept six integer parameters representing the coordinates of three distinct points and return half of the area of the triangle formed by these points.
