Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `area` is calculated using the formula `area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)` based on the integer values of `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)` where -1000 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 1000, and no three points are collinear and no two points are identical.**
