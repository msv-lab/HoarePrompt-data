Functionality: ** The function accepts six integer parameters representing the coordinates of three distinct points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3). It calculates and returns half of the area of the triangle formed by these points using the formula area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2). The expected input conditions are that no three points are collinear and no two points are identical. **
