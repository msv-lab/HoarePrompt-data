Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The task is to determine the maximum number of coprime common divisors of two positive integers A and B. However, the function `func_1(n)` is designed solely to check if a single integer `n` is prime or not, returning `True` for prime numbers and `False` for non-prime numbers.

Here are the key reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Purpose Mismatch**: The function does not address the problem of finding the maximum number of coprime common divisors of both A and B. It simply checks for the primality of a number.

2. **Lack of Common Divisor Logic**: There is no logic in the provided function to compute the common divisors of A and B, nor to check if they are coprime. The problem requires the identification of common divisors and the selection of those that are coprime, which is not handled at all.

3. **Input Handling**: The program does not accept two integers A and B as input, nor does it return the maximum count of coprime common divisors. It only takes a single integer `n`, which is unrelated to the requirements of the problem.

To summarize, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description; it fails to compute the maximum number of coprime common divisors of A and B, thus rendering it incorrect.
