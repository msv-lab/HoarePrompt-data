To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the hints given.

### Problem Description Summary
The task is to find the maximum number of positive common divisors of two integers A and B such that any two chosen divisors are coprime. 

### Code Analysis
1. The code first collects all divisors of A and B. 
2. It then checks for common divisors between A and B.
3. It uses the `func_1(n)` function to check if a divisor is prime.
4. Finally, it counts how many common divisors are prime.

### Potential Issues
1. The logic for counting coprime divisors is flawed: The code only counts prime common divisors. However, the problem does not specify that the selected divisors must be prime; they must only be coprime.
2. The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime but does not correctly handle the case when n is 1. According to the problem description, 1 is a common divisor but not coprime with any number except itself. Thus, it should still be counted in the context of common divisors.
3. The program does not ensure that the selected divisors are coprime; it only counts those that are prime. For example, if A = 6 (divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6) and B = 9 (divisors: 1, 3, 9), the common divisors are 1 and 3. While 1 can be chosen, 3 cannot be chosen alongside 1 if the goal is to maximize the number of coprime divisors.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints suggest that the function returns True for prime numbers and False otherwise, which matches the `func_1(n)` definition. However, they also indicate that the function does not handle cases where n is less than 1, which is not applicable here since the inputs are guaranteed to be positive integers. This hint indicates that the function does not accurately represent the conditions needed to solve the problem.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The failure to correctly count coprime common divisors, alongside the misleading output hints, demonstrates that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly counts only the prime common divisors instead of all coprime divisors, which does not satisfy the problem's requirements. For example, when A = 12 and B = 18, the common divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Only counting prime common divisors would incorrectly return 3 instead of the intended maximum count of coprime divisors.
