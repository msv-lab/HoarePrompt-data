Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that computes the maximum number of coprime common divisors of two positive integers A and B. 

However, the provided program only checks if a single integer `n` is prime or not. It does not consider the integers A and B, does not find their common divisors, and does not calculate how many of those common divisors can be coprime. 

Here are the specific reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Single Integer Focus**: The function `func_1` only takes a single integer `n` and checks if it is prime. It does not accept or process the two integers A and B as required by the problem.

2. **Missing Logic for Common Divisors**: The program does not implement any logic to find the common divisors of A and B, which is a crucial part of the problem. 

3. **Coprime Requirement**: The problem specifies that the selected divisors must be coprime. The program completely ignores this aspect and focuses only on primality of a single number.

4. **Lack of Output**: The program does not output the maximum number of coprime common divisors, which is the required output according to the problem description.

In summary, the program fails to address the main requirements of the problem, making it incorrect.
