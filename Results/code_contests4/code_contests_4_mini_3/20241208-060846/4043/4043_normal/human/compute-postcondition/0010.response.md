According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate starting from `k = 2` up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, which means the loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. Since `n` is at least 4 and not divisible by 2, we need to determine the value of `int(math.sqrt(n))`. Given that `n` is at least 4, the minimum value for `int(math.sqrt(n))` is 2. Therefore, `k` can increase to the next integer, which is 4, for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute a fourth time, `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. If `k` is now 4, this means `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 4.

State: **`A` and `B` are positive integers, `n` is at least 4 and not divisible by 2, `k` is 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `n` must be at least 16 (so that int(math.sqrt(n)) is at least 4)**
