According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k`. The loop starts with `k` initialized to 2 and continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. 

Given that `n` is at least 4 and is not divisible by 2, `int(math.sqrt(n))` will be at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1 after the current iteration. 

Thus, `k` will become 3 for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. As long as `int(math.sqrt(n))` is greater than or equal to 3 (which it will be since `n` is at least 4), the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`A` is a positive integer, `B` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 4, `k` is 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2, for the loop to execute a third time `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
