#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, and n is not equal to 1.
    for k in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` and `B` are positive integers, `n` is at least 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and if the loop completes all iterations without returning False, then `n` is a prime number; otherwise, `n` is composite.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that n is a prime number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns True if `n` is a prime number, False if `n` is not prime (including when `n` is equal to 1 or any composite number). The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, as the input is expected to be within the range of 1 to 10^12.
