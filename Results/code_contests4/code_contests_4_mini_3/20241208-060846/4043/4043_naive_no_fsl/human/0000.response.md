To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and identify any flaws or missing cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to find the maximum number of positive common divisors of two integers \( A \) and \( B \) such that all chosen divisors are coprime.
2. A common divisor \( d \) of \( A \) and \( B \) must divide both numbers.
3. Divisors must be pairwise coprime, meaning any two divisors must not share any common divisor other than 1.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Finding Common Divisors**:
   - The code finds all divisors of \( A \) and \( B \) by iterating up to the square root of each number and checking divisibility.
   - It collects the divisors of \( A \) in list `a` and the divisors of \( B \) in list `b`.

2. **Identifying Common Divisors**:
   - It checks each divisor in `a` to see if it is also in `b` and if it is prime using the `func_1` function.

3. **Counting Coprime Common Divisors**:
   - The program counts the common divisors that are prime, which is incorrect as it does not consider non-prime coprime numbers (e.g., 6 and 10).

### Flaw in the Code:
The primary flaw is that the program only counts prime common divisors. It ignores the possibility that non-prime numbers can also be coprime. For instance:
- Consider \( A = 6 \) and \( B = 10 \):
  - Common divisors are \( 1 \) and \( 2 \), both of which are coprime.
  - The program would output \( 1 \) because only \( 2 \) is counted as it is prime, but the correct answer should be \( 2 \) because both \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) can be chosen.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to count all valid coprime common divisors, it does not meet the problem's requirement for all inputs.

Correctness: **False**
