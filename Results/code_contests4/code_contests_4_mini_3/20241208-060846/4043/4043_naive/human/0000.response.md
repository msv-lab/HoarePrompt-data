To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description.

**Problem Description Recap:**
We need to find the maximum number of positive common divisors of two integers A and B such that any two of the chosen divisors are coprime. 

**Program Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number `n` is prime. This function is correctly implemented.
2. The program reads two integers A and B.
3. It finds all divisors of A and B.
4. It counts how many of these common divisors are prime (coprime with each other by definition).

### Key Issues in the Program:
- The program only counts the prime common divisors, but the problem asks for the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen such that they are coprime. 
- For example, if A = 12 (divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) and B = 18 (divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18), the common divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. However, 2 and 3 can be chosen together because they are coprime, while 6 cannot be chosen with either 2 or 3 since it has common factors with both. Thus, a correct output could involve choosing 2, 3, and possibly 1, leading to a maximum count of 3.
- The logic fails to account for the fact that non-prime common divisors can also be coprime with others. For instance, choosing 1 (which is coprime with every number) allows for more combinations.

### Counterexample:
Using the provided inputs:
- Input: `12 18`
  - Common divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6
  - The primes are 2 and 3, but we can also choose 1 with either of these, leading to a valid count of 3. 

The output of the program would be 2 (counting only the prime common divisors), while it should be 3.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case due to its restriction on counting only prime common divisors.

Correctness: **False**.
