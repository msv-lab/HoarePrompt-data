The list `p` is modified such that each element `pi` in the original list `p` is decreased by 1. Since `p` is a list of integers from the input, the values of `p` will change accordingly. The variable `n` remains unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of integers with each element decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of integers with each element decreased by 1.**
