The value of `odd` is updated by adding the result of the expression `abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `abs(0 * 2 + 1 - p[0])`, which is `abs(1 - p[0])`. The specific value of `p[0]` is not provided, but it is known that `p` is a list of integers with each element decreased by 1. The value of `odd` will increase by the absolute difference between 1 and `p[0]`.

The previous values of the affected variables are: 
- `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 (not directly affecting this calculation).
- `p` is a list of integers decreased by 1.
- `even` is updated to `even + p[0]` (not affecting `odd` in this calculation).
- `odd` is currently 0.
- `i` is 0.

Thus, after executing the code, `odd` would be updated to `odd + abs(1 - p[0])`, where `odd` starts at 0.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers with each element decreased by 1, `even` is updated to `even + p[0]`, `odd` is updated to `abs(1 - p[0])`, `i` is 0**.
