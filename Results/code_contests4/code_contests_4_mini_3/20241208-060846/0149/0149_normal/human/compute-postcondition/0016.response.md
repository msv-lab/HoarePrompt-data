Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of distinct integers `p` (where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ pi ≤ n). It calculates two sums: `even`, which is the total distance of each adjusted position at even indices from their expected positions, and `odd`, which is the total distance for odd indices. The function then prints the minimum of these two sums. However, it does not handle cases where `p` contains integers outside the specified range or where `n` is not exactly even, even though the precondition states that `n` will always be even. **
