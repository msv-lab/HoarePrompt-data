The variables `even` and `odd` are both initialized to 0. The previous values of `n` and `p` are not directly affected by this initialization, but they are available for potential future calculations. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of `even` and `odd`, while `n` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of integers with each element decreased by 1; `even` is 0; `odd` is 0**
