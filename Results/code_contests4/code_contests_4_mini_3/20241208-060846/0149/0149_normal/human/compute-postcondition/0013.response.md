The loop iterates `n / 2` times, accumulating the values of `even` and `odd`. For each iteration, `even` is updated based on the absolute difference between `i * 2` and `p[i]`, while `odd` is updated based on the absolute difference between `i * 2 + 1` and `p[i]`. 

After all iterations of the loop have executed, `even` will be the sum of all computed values from `abs(i * 2 - p[i])` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n/2 - 1`, and `odd` will be the sum of all computed values from `abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])` for the same range of `i`.

Since `n` is an even integer within the specified range, the loop will execute exactly `n / 2` times.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of integers with each element decreased by 1; `even` is the sum of `abs(i * 2 - p[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n/2 - 1`; `odd` is the sum of `abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n/2 - 1.**
