The variable `p` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the split input line read from standard input. The input line will be a string of space-separated integers. The previous value of `n` does not influence `p`, and the values of `p` depend entirely on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of integers from the input.**
