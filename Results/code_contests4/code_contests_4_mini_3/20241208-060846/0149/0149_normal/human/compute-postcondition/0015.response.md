The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `positions`. The parameter `n` is an even integer constrained between 2 and 100. The parameter `positions` is a list of distinct integers where each integer is constrained to be between 1 and `n`. After executing the function body, the output is based on the values of `n` and `positions`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an even integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `positions`, both adhering to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of distinct integers positions (1 ≤ pi ≤ n).**
