Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop iterates for `n / 2`, which is correct in terms of calculating the target positions for `even` and `odd` sums, however, it uses the original `p` list without considering the correct mapping of pieces to target positions based on their color (black or white).

2. **Misalignment in `p` Handling**: The program assumes that the first half of `p` corresponds to the even indices of the target positions (black cells) and the second half corresponds to the odd indices (white cells). However, the way that `p` is constructed and utilized does not guarantee that this is the case. The pieces could be located randomly across either color, and the target positions must be explicitly calculated based on the pieces' current positions.

3. **Calculation of Moves**: The calculation of `even` and `odd` sums is done without properly assigning pieces to their respective target positions, leading to potentially incorrect move counts. The program should instead count how many moves are needed to align all pieces to either all black or all white cells based on their current positions.

In conclusion, the program does not properly account for the random distribution of pieces across the chessboard and fails to accurately compute the minimal moves required to gather them on cells of the same color.
