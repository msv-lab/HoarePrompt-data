Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an even integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `p` representing the initial positions of the chess pieces. The constraints mentioned in the problem description (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ pi ≤ n) are respected, as the program assumes these preconditions hold true (as stated in the comments).

2. **Position Adjustment**: The program adjusts the positions in `p` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python uses zero-based indexing. This adjustment does not affect the correctness of the solution since the logic for calculating moves will still hold true relative to the adjusted positions.

3. **Calculating Moves**:
   - The program calculates the minimum number of moves required to align all pieces to either the black or white cells.
   - It iterates through half of the board (since `n` is even) and sums the absolute differences between the adjusted positions and their target positions for both even and odd indexed cells. This is done by calculating:
     - `even`, which corresponds to moves to the black cells (even indices).
     - `odd`, which corresponds to moves to the white cells (odd indices).
   - The logic implemented correctly ensures that the total distance for both configurations (all pieces on even indices and all pieces on odd indices) is computed.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the minimum of the two calculated sums (`even` and `odd`), which aligns with the requirement of finding the minimum number of moves to group all pieces on cells of the same color.

5. **No Edge Cases Missed**: The program does not need additional checks for the constraints mentioned, since it is guaranteed by the problem statement that `n` will always be even and the positions will be valid. Therefore, all inputs will be handled correctly under the given assumptions.

Overall, the program adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description, correctly computes the necessary values, and outputs the desired result. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
