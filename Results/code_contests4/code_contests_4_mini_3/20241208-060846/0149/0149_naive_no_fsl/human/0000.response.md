To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic in detail.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the positions of the chess pieces from the input.

2. **Index Adjustment**: The program adjusts the positions of the pieces to be zero-based (i.e., `p = [pi - 1 for pi in p]`).

3. **Move Calculation**:
   - It calculates the total number of moves required to move all pieces to the "even" positions (0, 2, 4, ...).
   - It also calculates the total number of moves required to move all pieces to the "odd" positions (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - The calculations are as follows:
     - For "even" positions: `even += abs(i * 2 - p[i])`
     - For "odd" positions: `odd += abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])`
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two totals.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program iterates `for i in range(n / 2)`, which is incorrect in Python 3, as it should be `range(n // 2)` because `n / 2` produces a float.
   - This will cause a `TypeError` when trying to index `p[i]` since `i` will not be an integer.

5. **Example Case**:
   - If `n = 6` and `p = [1, 2, 6]`, the program would attempt to run `for i in range(3.0)` which is invalid.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the program contains a logical error due to incorrect handling of range iteration. This results in the inability to correctly process input as expected.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to execute correctly due to the use of float in the range function, which will lead to an error in any actual execution.
