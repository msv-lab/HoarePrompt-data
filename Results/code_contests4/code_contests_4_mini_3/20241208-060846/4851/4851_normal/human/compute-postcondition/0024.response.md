Postcondition: ***`stack` contains elements from `a` that are greater than or equal to `i`, along with the new element `i`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If the length of `stack` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last two elements of `stack`.***
