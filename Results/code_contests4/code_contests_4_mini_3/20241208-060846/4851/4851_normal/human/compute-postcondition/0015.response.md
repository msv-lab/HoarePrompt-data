The operation `stack.pop()` removes the last element from `stack`. Since `stack` initially contains the first element of `a`, after popping, `stack` will no longer contain that element. The variable `ans` remains unchanged because the operation does not directly affect it. The length of `stack` will be reduced by one, but since it was initialized with the first element of `a`, we cannot determine its previous state beyond that.

Output State: **`stack` no longer contains the first element of `a`, `ans` remains unchanged**.
