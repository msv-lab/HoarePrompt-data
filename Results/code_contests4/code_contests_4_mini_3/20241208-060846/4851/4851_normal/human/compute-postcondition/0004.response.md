According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `stack` and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` (i.e., `stack[-1]`) is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` has one less element after popping, which means it is not guaranteed that `stack` is non-empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `stack` must still contain at least one element, and that element must be less than `i`.

Since `i` is the first element of `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers, we need to ensure that there is an element in `stack` that is less than `i`. To satisfy this condition, `stack` must contain at least one element that is less than `i`.

State: **`a` is a list of distinct positive integers with at least 2 elements; `stack` has one less element after popping and for the loop to execute again, `stack` must contain at least one element that is less than `i`**
