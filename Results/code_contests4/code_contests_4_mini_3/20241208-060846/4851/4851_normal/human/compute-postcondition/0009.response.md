The value of `i` is appended to `stack`, which changes the state of `stack` from empty to containing the first element of the list `a`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `stack` is now containing the first element of `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`stack` is now containing the first element of `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `a**.
