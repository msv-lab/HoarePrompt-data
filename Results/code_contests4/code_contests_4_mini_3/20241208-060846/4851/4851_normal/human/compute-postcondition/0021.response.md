The value of `i` is appended to the `stack`. Since `stack` already contains elements from `a` that are greater than or equal to `i`, the new value of `i` is added to it. The variable `ans` remains unchanged and is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` now contains elements from `a` that are greater than or equal to `i`, along with the new element `i`; `ans` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`stack` now contains elements from `a` that are greater than or equal to `i`, along with the new element `i`; `ans` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to the second element of `a**.
