The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`. `a` is a list of distinct positive integers with a length `n` such that `1 < n â‰¤ 10^5` and each integer in `a` is between `1` and `10^9`. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum bitwise XOR of any two distinct elements from `a` that are greater than or equal to the last element processed from `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of distinct positive integers and return the maximum bitwise XOR of any two distinct elements from the filtered list based on the last processed element. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of distinct positive integers and returns the maximum bitwise XOR of any two distinct elements from the list that are greater than or equal to the last processed element.**
