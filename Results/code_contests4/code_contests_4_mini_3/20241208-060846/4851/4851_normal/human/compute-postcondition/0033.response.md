`stack` is modified by appending the value of `i` to it. The contents of `stack` will now include `i` as an additional element, while `ans` remains unchanged and the original elements in `stack` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements that are greater than or equal to `i`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is added to `stack`.

Output State: **`stack` contains elements that are greater than or equal to `i`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is added to `stack`.**
