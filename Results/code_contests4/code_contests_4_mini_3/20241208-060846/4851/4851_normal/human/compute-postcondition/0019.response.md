The `stack.pop()` operation removes the last element from `stack`. Since the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the specific value of the last element is not directly relevant for the state after the operation, but it confirms that the stack is being modified. The other elements in `stack` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements before the pop operation, and after executing `stack.pop()`, the last element has been removed.

Output State: **`stack` contains elements before the pop operation; the last element has been removed from `stack`.**
