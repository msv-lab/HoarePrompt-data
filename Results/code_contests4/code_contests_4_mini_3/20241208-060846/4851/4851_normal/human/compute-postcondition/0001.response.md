According to the code, the for loop will iterate over the elements in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least 1 element, which is guaranteed by the condition that its length `n` is greater than 1. 

Before the loop starts, `stack` is an empty list and `ans` is 0. The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration. 

Since `a` is a list of distinct positive integers and its length is guaranteed to be at least 2, the first element of `a` will be available for the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` will be the first element of `a`, and the states do not need to be adjusted further.

State: **`a` is a list of distinct positive integers with at least 2 elements, `stack` is [], `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `a`**
