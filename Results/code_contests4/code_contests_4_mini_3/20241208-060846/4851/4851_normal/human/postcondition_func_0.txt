The function accepts a list of distinct positive integers and returns the maximum bitwise XOR of any two distinct elements from that list, considering only those elements that are greater than or equal to the last processed element in the list. If there are fewer than two such elements, the function will return 0, as there are no pairs to calculate the XOR.
