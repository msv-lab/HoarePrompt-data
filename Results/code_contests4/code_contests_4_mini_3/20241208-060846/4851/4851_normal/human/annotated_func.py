#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of distinct positive integers with a length n such that 1 < n â‰¤ 10^5 and each integer in a is between 1 and 10^9.
def func_1(a):
    stack, ans = [], 0
    for i in a:
        while stack and stack[-1] < i:
            stack.pop()
        
        stack.append(i)
        
        if len(stack) > 1:
            ans = max(ans, stack[-1] ^ stack[-2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` contains the elements of `a` that are greater than or equal to the last element processed from `a`, `ans` is the maximum bitwise XOR of any two distinct elements from `stack`, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers.
    return ans
    #The program returns the maximum bitwise XOR of any two distinct elements from the 'stack', which contains elements of 'a' that are greater than or equal to the last element processed from 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of distinct positive integers and returns the maximum bitwise XOR of any two distinct elements from that list, considering only those elements that are greater than or equal to the last processed element in the list. If there are fewer than two such elements, the function will return 0, as there are no pairs to calculate the XOR.
