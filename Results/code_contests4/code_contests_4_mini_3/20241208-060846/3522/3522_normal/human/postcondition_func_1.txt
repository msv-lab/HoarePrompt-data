The function accepts an integer `p`, representing the number of queries, and a list `value`, which contains queries of specific forms. It adjusts the value of `p` and updates a binary tree structure named `tree` based on the computations of the queries. However, the function does not return any results or outputs; it only modifies the internal state of the `tree`. There is no handling for the actual queries defined in the list, and the functionality for processing different types of queries is missing.
