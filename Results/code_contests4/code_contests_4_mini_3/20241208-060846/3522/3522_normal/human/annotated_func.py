#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, Q is a positive integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000, and each query consists of either "1 i_q c_q" where 1 <= i_q <= N and c_q is a lowercase English letter, or "2 l_q r_q" where 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N. There is at least one query of type 2.
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= N), `tree[ddd][n + i]` is equal to `arr[i]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000; `n` is a positive integer (n >= 2); `i` is 0; `tree[ddd][i]` is updated to the sum of all `tree[ddd][j]` for `j` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, effectively representing a complete binary tree structure derived from the initial `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and constructs a binary tree structure based on the input array. It initializes the tree with the elements of `arr` and computes the cumulative sums for the tree nodes, facilitating efficient range sum queries. However, it does not handle or return results for the specified queries of type "1 i_q c_q", which implies modification of the string, nor does it process the queries of type "2 l_q r_q" to return results. Therefore, the function is incomplete as it only builds the tree without providing any query processing capabilities.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is an integer representing the number of queries, value is a list of queries where each query is either of the form [1, i_q, c_q] or [2, l_q, r_q] with 1 <= i_q <= N, 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N, and c_q is a lowercase English letter.
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 1, `p` is greater than 1, and the values in `tree[ddd]` have been updated based on the computations performed during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `p`, representing the number of queries, and a list `value`, which contains queries of specific forms. It adjusts the value of `p` and updates a binary tree structure named `tree` based on the computations of the queries. However, the function does not return any results or outputs; it only modifies the internal state of the `tree`. There is no handling for the actual queries defined in the list, and the functionality for processing different types of queries is missing.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is equal to the final halved value of the original `l`, `r` is equal to the final halved value of the original `r`, `res` is the sum of the values from `tree[ddd][l]` and `tree[ddd][r]` based on the conditions of odd/even for `l` and `r` throughout all iterations of the loop.
    return res
    #The program returns the sum 'res' of the values from 'tree[ddd][l]' and 'tree[ddd][r]' based on the conditions of odd/even for 'l' and 'r' throughout all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `l` and `r`, and returns the sum of values from a data structure `tree[ddd]` based on the modified indices of `l` and `r`. The function adjusts `l` and `r` by adding `n` and then sums the relevant values based on whether `l` and `r` are odd or even, effectively calculating the sum of a range in a segment tree. It does not handle cases where `l` or `r` might exceed the bounds of the `tree[ddd]` array, which could lead to an IndexError.
