The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and constructs a binary tree structure based on the input array. It initializes the tree with the elements of `arr` and computes the cumulative sums for the tree nodes, facilitating efficient range sum queries. However, it does not handle or return results for the specified queries of type "1 i_q c_q", which implies modification of the string, nor does it process the queries of type "2 l_q r_q" to return results. Therefore, the function is incomplete as it only builds the tree without providing any query processing capabilities.
