Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Update Operation Handling**:
   - The problem description specifies that for a type 1 query (1 i_q c_q), the program should change the i_q-th character of the string S to c_q if it is not already c_q. However, in the given program, there is no direct handling of the string S or the specific character updates. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not manipulate the string S directly and instead seem to be working with an unspecified tree structure (`tree[ddd]`) which is not defined or explained in the context of the problem.

2. **Count of Different Characters**:
   - For a type 2 query (2 l_q r_q), the program must count the number of distinct characters in the substring S[l_q-1:r_q]. The function `func_3` appears to sum values from a tree structure, which does not correspond to counting distinct characters. The implementation does not utilize any method to determine the uniqueness of characters in the specified range.

3. **Lack of Implementation for Queries**:
   - The program lacks a main function or a clear flow that processes the input and executes the queries according to the problem description. There is no clear sequence for reading the input, processing each query, and producing the output.

In summary, the program does not maintain the string S or correctly implement the character update and counting operations required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
