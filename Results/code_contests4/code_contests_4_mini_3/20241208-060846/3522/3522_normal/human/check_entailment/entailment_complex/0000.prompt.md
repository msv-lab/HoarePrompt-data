You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process Q queries of the following two types:

* Type 1: change the i_q-th character of S to c_q. (Do nothing if the i_q-th character is already c_q.)
* Type 2: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive).

Constraints

* N, Q, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers.
* S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* c_q is a lowercase English letter.
* 1 \leq N \leq 500000
* 1 \leq Q \leq 20000
* |S| = N
* 1 \leq i_q \leq N
* 1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N
* There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S
Q
Query_1
\vdots
Query_Q


Here, Query_i in the 4-th through (Q+3)-th lines is one of the following:


1 i_q c_q



2 l_q r_q


Output

For each query of type 2, print a line containing the answer.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, Q is a positive integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000, and each query consists of either "1 i_q c_q" where 1 <= i_q <= N and c_q is a lowercase English letter, or "2 l_q r_q" where 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N. There is at least one query of type 2.
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= N), `tree[ddd][n + i]` is equal to `arr[i]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000; `n` is a positive integer (n >= 2); `i` is 0; `tree[ddd][i]` is updated to the sum of all `tree[ddd][j]` for `j` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, effectively representing a complete binary tree structure derived from the initial `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and constructs a binary tree structure based on the input array. It initializes the tree with the elements of `arr` and computes the cumulative sums for the tree nodes, facilitating efficient range sum queries. However, it does not handle or return results for the specified queries of type "1 i_q c_q", which implies modification of the string, nor does it process the queries of type "2 l_q r_q" to return results. Therefore, the function is incomplete as it only builds the tree without providing any query processing capabilities.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is an integer representing the number of queries, value is a list of queries where each query is either of the form [1, i_q, c_q] or [2, l_q, r_q] with 1 <= i_q <= N, 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N, and c_q is a lowercase English letter.
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 1, `p` is greater than 1, and the values in `tree[ddd]` have been updated based on the computations performed during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `p`, representing the number of queries, and a list `value`, which contains queries of specific forms. It adjusts the value of `p` and updates a binary tree structure named `tree` based on the computations of the queries. However, the function does not return any results or outputs; it only modifies the internal state of the `tree`. There is no handling for the actual queries defined in the list, and the functionality for processing different types of queries is missing.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, Q is a positive integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000, and each query consists of either '1 i_q c_q' or '2 l_q r_q' where 1 <= i_q <= N and 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N, and c_q is a lowercase English letter.
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is equal to the final halved value of the original `l`, `r` is equal to the final halved value of the original `r`, `res` is the sum of the values from `tree[ddd][l]` and `tree[ddd][r]` based on the conditions of odd/even for `l` and `r` throughout all iterations of the loop.
    return res
    #The program returns the sum 'res' of the values from 'tree[ddd][l]' and 'tree[ddd][r]' based on the conditions of odd/even for 'l' and 'r' throughout all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `l` and `r`, and returns the sum of values from a data structure `tree[ddd]` based on the modified indices of `l` and `r`. The function adjusts `l` and `r` by adding `n` and then sums the relevant values based on whether `l` and `r` are odd or even, effectively calculating the sum of a range in a segment tree. It does not handle cases where `l` or `r` might exceed the bounds of the `tree[ddd]` array, which could lead to an IndexError.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
