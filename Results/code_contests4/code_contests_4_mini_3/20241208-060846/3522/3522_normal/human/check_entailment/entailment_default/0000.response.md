To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the functions step by step.

### Problem Description:
The program is supposed to handle two types of queries on a string:
1. **Type 1:** Change a specific character in the string.
2. **Type 2:** Count the number of different characters in a specified substring.

### Functions Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function initializes a binary tree based on an input array. It does not process any queries and only prepares the tree for potential operations, which is not what we need for the query handling described in the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function updates a specific index in the binary tree with a new value. It does not directly handle the queries as specified in the problem description, particularly for the Type 1 queries.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function calculates the sum over a specified range in the binary tree. While it processes ranges, it does not correctly handle the query of counting distinct characters in the substring, nor does it account for updating the tree correctly based on character changes.

### Output Descriptions for Functions:
- **Func_1:** Incomplete for the required operations as it does not process any queries.
- **Func_2:** Also incomplete as it only modifies the tree without handling character changes for queries.
- **Func_3:** Only sums values without checking for distinct characters, and does not handle potential index errors or the logic needed to count distinct characters.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle cases where there are consecutive updates to the same character (Type 1 queries) correctly, as it does not check if the character is already the same.
- For Type 2 queries, there is no logic to count distinct characters. The implementation just sums values in the tree without checking which characters are present in the substring.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It lacks the necessary logic to fully process the required queries and does not handle edge cases effectively.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly implement the functionality for counting distinct characters within the given substring range and does not handle character updates correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.
