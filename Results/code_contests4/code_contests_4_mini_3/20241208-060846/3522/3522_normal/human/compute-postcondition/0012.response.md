The value of `l` is right-shifted by 1 (divided by 2), which means that `l` is halved. The initial state describes how `l` is an even integer less than `r`, and it also notes some conditions regarding `r` and `n`, but these are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is the value of `tree[ddd][l]` added to `tree[ddd][r]` if `r` was odd, making `l` an even integer less than `r`, and `r` becomes even after decrementing by 1; `l` is now halved due to right shift.
