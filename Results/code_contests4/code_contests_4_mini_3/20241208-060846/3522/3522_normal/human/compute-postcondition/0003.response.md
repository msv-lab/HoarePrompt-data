According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than `r`. Right before the loop, `l` is increased by `n` and `r` is also increased by `n`. However, without knowing the initial values of `l` and `r`, we cannot determine their relationship after being incremented.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that `l` is less than `r` after they have both been increased by `n`. This means that before the loop, `l` must be less than `r` prior to the incrementing. 

Thus, to ensure that `l < r`, we can adjust the initial values such that the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than the value of `n`:

State: **`res` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time, `l` must be less than `r` before they are both increased by `n`**.
