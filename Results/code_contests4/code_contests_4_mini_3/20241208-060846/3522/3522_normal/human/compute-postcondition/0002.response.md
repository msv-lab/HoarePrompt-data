The value of `r` is incremented by `n`, but the previous values of `r` and `n` are unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `r`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The Output State is: `res` is 0; `l` is increased by `n`; `r` is increased by `n`.

Output State: **`res` is 0; `l` is increased by `n`; `r` is increased by `n`.**
