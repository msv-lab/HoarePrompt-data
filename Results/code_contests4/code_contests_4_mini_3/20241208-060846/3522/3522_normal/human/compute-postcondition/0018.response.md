Output State: **`res` is the value of `tree[ddd][l]` added to `tree[ddd][r]` if `r` was odd. If `l` is odd, then `l` is halved, `r` is right-shifted by 1, and `res` is updated by adding `tree[ddd][l]` to its current value, while `l` is incremented by 1. If `r` is not odd, the state of `res`, `l`, and `r` remains unchanged; `r` is decremented by 1.**
