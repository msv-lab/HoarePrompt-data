According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop can execute again if `l` is less than `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is currently halved and `r` is right-shifted by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must remain less than `r`. Since `l` has been halved, for the next iteration to proceed, `r` must still be greater than the new value of `l`. Therefore, if we denote the previous values of `l` and `r` as `l'` and `r'`, respectively, we can conclude that:

- `r` must be greater than `2 * l`, because `l` is halved.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to state that `r` must be greater than `2 * l`.

State: **`res` is the value of `tree[ddd][l]` added to `tree[ddd][r]` if `r` was odd, `l` is now halved, `r` is the value of `r` right-shifted by 1, and for the loop to execute again `r` must be greater than 2 * l**
