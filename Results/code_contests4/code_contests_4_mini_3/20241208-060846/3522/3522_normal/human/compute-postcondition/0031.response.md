Output State: **If `r` is odd, `res` is updated by adding the value of `tree[ddd][r]` to its current value, and `r` is decremented by 1; if `r` is even, `res` remains unchanged and `r` is not modified; `l` is halved using a right shift operation. After the operation, `r` is halved using a right shift operation.**
