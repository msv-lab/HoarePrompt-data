According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is unchanged, and `r` is updated by right shifting its value by 1.

Since `l` is unchanged and `r` has been right shifted, this means `r` has decreased. If `l` is less than the original value of `r`, then after the right shift, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must also be less than the new value of `r` (which is `r` divided by 2).

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than the new value of `r` after the right shift operation. 

State: **If r is odd, then res is updated by adding the value of tree[ddd][r] to its current value, while l remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again, l must be less than the new value of r after right shift.**
