The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are positive integers that represent indices within a certain range. After executing the function body, it returns the sum `res` of values from a data structure based on the indices `l` and `r`, taking into account whether they are odd or even throughout all iterations of a loop. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_3 is to accept two positive integer parameters `l` and `r`, and return a calculated sum based on specific conditions related to those indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, l and r, and returns the sum res of values from a data structure based on whether l and r are odd or even.**
