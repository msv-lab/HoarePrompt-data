To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the implementation closely.

### Understanding the Problem Description
1. **Type 1 Query:** Change the character at position `i_q` to `c_q`. If the character is already `c_q`, it should do nothing.
2. **Type 2 Query:** Count the number of distinct characters in the substring from `l_q` to `r_q`.

### Analyzing the Program
1. The program initializes a segment tree (`tree`) to maintain counts of each character across the string.
2. The `func_1` function populates the segment tree with initial counts of characters.
3. The `func_2` function updates the segment tree when a character change occurs.
4. The `func_3` function retrieves the count of characters in a specified range.

### Potential Issues
1. **Boundary Conditions:** The queries are 1-indexed, but the implementation works with 0-indexed arrays. The conversion from 1-indexed to 0-indexed needs to be consistently handled throughout the implementation.
2. **Character Count Logic:** In the `func_3` function, it checks if the result from `func_3` is not zero to increment the answer. However, it does not account correctly for counting distinct characters. It should check if the count of each character is greater than zero in the specified range.
3. **Update Logic:** When performing updates (Type 1 queries), the logic should ensure that the tree is updated correctly and that the previous character's count is decremented.

### Specific Case of Failure
- Consider the input:
  ```
  5
  aaaaa
  1
  1 1 b
  2 1 5
  ```
  Here, we are trying to change the first character from 'a' to 'b', and then counting distinct characters in the whole string. After the update, the string should be "baaaa", which has 2 distinct characters ('b' and 'a'), but the program's logic in counting distinct characters may not function correctly due to the flaws identified above.

Due to the reasons mentioned, particularly the incorrect handling of distinct character counting and potential mishandling of updates, the program does not meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**.
