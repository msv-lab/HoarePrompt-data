Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000) and returns the sum of `x` and the result of `func_1(x)`. The behavior of `func_1(x)` is not defined within the provided code, so the overall result depends on the implementation of `func_1`. There are no additional edge cases or conditions to consider based solely on the given code. **
