Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully implement the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The problem requires the program to find a positive integer \( a \) such that \( a + ar = n \), where \( ar \) is the reverse of \( a \). The program only implements a function to reverse a number and a function to compute the sum of a number and its reverse. However, it does not attempt to find a valid \( a \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Output Requirement**: The problem states that if no such \( a \) exists, the program should print `0`. The provided program does not contain any logic to check different possible values of \( a \) or to validate if \( a + ar = n \).

3. **Lack of Loop or Iteration**: The program lacks any mechanism to iterate over potential values of \( a \) to check which ones would satisfy the equation \( a + ar = n \). It does not explore possible candidates for \( a \) based on the value of \( n \).

4. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: While the problem specifies that \( a \) must not have leading zeros, the program does not include any checks to ensure that the resulting \( a \) meets this criterion.

In summary, while the functions defined in the program perform specific operations (reversing a number and summing it with its reverse), they do not implement the logic necessary to find a valid \( a \) based on the input \( n \). Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description.
