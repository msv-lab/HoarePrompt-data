To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the functions and the requirements step by step.

1. **Problem Description Recap**: 
   - We need to find a positive integer `a` such that `a + ar = n`, where `ar` is the integer obtained by reversing the digits of `a`. The integer `a` must not have leading zeroes.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes a positive integer `x` and returns the integer formed by reversing its digits. This function correctly handles integers without leading zeroes since it only processes positive integers and returns the integer representation, which inherently discards any leading zeroes.
  
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes a positive integer `x` and returns the sum of `x` and its reversal (`func_1(x)`). This function also respects the constraints of the problem as `x` is always positive and within the specified bounds.

3. **Logic in the Code**:
   - The main logic of the program should iterate over potential values of `a`, calculate `ar`, and check if `a + ar` equals `n`. However, the provided code does not implement this iteration or check. Instead, it directly computes the sum of `x` and its reversal.

4. **Edge Cases and Examples**:
   - According to the problem description:
     - For `n = 5`, there is no valid `a` such that `a + ar = 5`. The expected output is `0`, but the program does not account for this case.
     - For `n = 33`, possible values of `a` could be `30`, `12`, or `21`. The program must check multiple values of `a` to find at least one valid solution.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not cover all cases as required by the problem description. It lacks the logic for iterating through possible values of `a` and verifying if any of them satisfy the equation `a + ar = n`.
   - Specifically, the program fails to return `0` when no valid `a` exists, which is a direct requirement of the problem description.

Given these observations, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
