You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vitya is studying in the third grade. During the last math lesson all the pupils wrote on arithmetic quiz. Vitya is a clever boy, so he managed to finish all the tasks pretty fast and Oksana Fillipovna gave him a new one, that is much harder.

Let's denote a flip operation of an integer as follows: number is considered in decimal notation and then reverted. If there are any leading zeroes afterwards, they are thrown away. For example, if we flip 123 the result is the integer 321, but flipping 130 we obtain 31, and by flipping 31 we come to 13.

Oksana Fillipovna picked some number a without leading zeroes, and flipped it to get number ar. Then she summed a and ar, and told Vitya the resulting value n. His goal is to find any valid a.

As Oksana Fillipovna picked some small integers as a and ar, Vitya managed to find the answer pretty fast and became interested in finding some general algorithm to deal with this problem. Now, he wants you to write the program that for given n finds any a without leading zeroes, such that a + ar = n or determine that such a doesn't exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10100 000).

Output

If there is no such positive integer a without leading zeroes that a + ar = n then print 0. Otherwise, print any valid a. If there are many possible answers, you are allowed to pick any.

Examples

Input

4


Output

2


Input

11


Output

10


Input

5


Output

0


Input

33


Output

21

Note

In the first sample 4 = 2 + 2, a = 2 is the only possibility.

In the second sample 11 = 10 + 1, a = 10 — the only valid solution. Note, that a = 01 is incorrect, because a can't have leading zeroes.

It's easy to check that there is no suitable a in the third sample.

In the fourth sample 33 = 30 + 3 = 12 + 21, so there are three possibilities for a: a = 30, a = 12, a = 21. Any of these is considered to be correct answer.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000.
def func_1(x):
    return int(str(x)[::-1])
    #The program returns the integer value of x with its digits reversed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` (which can be extremely large, up to 10^100000) and returns the integer value of `x` with its digits reversed. It does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, as those cases are not addressed in the code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000.
def func_2(x):
    return x + func_1(x)
    #The program returns the sum of positive integer x (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000) and the result of func_1(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000) and returns the sum of `x` and the result of `func_1(x)`. The behavior of `func_1(x)` is not defined within the provided code, so the overall result depends on the implementation of `func_1`. There are no additional edge cases or conditions to consider based solely on the given code.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
