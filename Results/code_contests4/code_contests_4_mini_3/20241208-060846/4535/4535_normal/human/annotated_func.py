#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000.
def func_1(x):
    return int(str(x)[::-1])
    #The program returns the integer value of x with its digits reversed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` (which can be extremely large, up to 10^100000) and returns the integer value of `x` with its digits reversed. It does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, as those cases are not addressed in the code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000.
def func_2(x):
    return x + func_1(x)
    #The program returns the sum of positive integer x (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000) and the result of func_1(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000) and returns the sum of `x` and the result of `func_1(x)`. The behavior of `func_1(x)` is not defined within the provided code, so the overall result depends on the implementation of `func_1`. There are no additional edge cases or conditions to consider based solely on the given code.
