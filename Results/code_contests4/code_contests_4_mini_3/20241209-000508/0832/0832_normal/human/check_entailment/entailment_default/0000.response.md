To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the code, the input/output hints, and any potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem describes a specific path that Lara takes in a 2D grid, starting from the top-left corner (1, 1) and moving to the bottom-left corner (n, 1), then alternating between moving right and up/down in a snake-like manner. The goal is to determine Lara's position after she has moved `k` times.

### Code Analysis
1. The program reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. It checks if `k` is less than `n`. If true, it directly outputs (1, k + 1) which represents her position in the first row.
3. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it adjusts `k` by subtracting `n`, then calculates how many complete "snake-like" rows Lara has traversed and the position within the current row.

### Logic Breakdown
- If `k < n`, it correctly identifies the position as being in the first row.
- For `k >= n`, the program calculates how many complete rows of movement Lara has done and what her current column is based on the remaining moves.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints specify:
- The function handles the input constraints correctly.
- It checks for the edge case of `k < n` and returns the expected result.
- It mentions that the function does not handle cases where `k` might equal or exceed `n * m`, which is indeed irrelevant since `k` is guaranteed to be less than `n * m` according to the problem constraints.

### Edge Case Consideration
We need to verify that the function correctly handles the edge case of `k` being at its maximum valid value (`k = n * m - 1`). However, since `k` is guaranteed to be less than `n * m`, this specific edge case won't occur. The program's logic appears sound based on the provided range of inputs.

### Conclusion
The program appears to follow the problem description correctly for all valid cases, as it handles moving through the grid according to the prescribed rules. I cannot find an example where the program deviates from the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**.
