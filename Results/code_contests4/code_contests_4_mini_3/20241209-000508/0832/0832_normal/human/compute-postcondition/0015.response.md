Functionality: ** The function accepts no direct parameters but reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from input, where `n` is an even integer and both `n` and `m` are in the range [2, 10^9], while `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ `k` < n * m. The function first checks if `k` is less than `n`, and if so, it prints (1, k + 1) and exits. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it calculates new values for `y` and `x` based on the adjusted value of `k` and then prints them. The function does not handle cases where `k` may equal or exceed `n * m`, as the input constraints ensure `k` is always less than this value.**
