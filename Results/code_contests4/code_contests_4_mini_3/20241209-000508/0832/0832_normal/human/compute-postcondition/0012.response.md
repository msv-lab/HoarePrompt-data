To analyze the given code snippet, let's break down the components:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is less than `n` and negative.
   - `y` is updated from 1 to `n - t`.
   - `t` is calculated as `k / (m - 1)`.
   - `x` is either `2 + p` or `m - p` depending on the parity of `t`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` function is used to output two values: `int(math.ceil(y))` and `int(x)`.
   - We need to determine the values of `y` and `x` based on the initial conditions and the calculations provided.

3. **Calculating `t`**:
   - Given that `k` is negative and `m - 1` is positive (since `m` must be greater than `1` for the division to be valid), `t` will be a negative number. 
   - The exact numeric value of `t` isn't provided, but we know it's negative.

4. **Calculating `y`**:
   - `y` is updated to `n - t`. Since `t` is negative, this means `y` will be greater than `n` (because subtracting a negative is adding).
   - Therefore, `y` will be `n + |t|`, where `|t|` is the absolute value of `t`.

5. **Determining `x`**:
   - Since `t` is negative, it is an even number (negative even). Hence, the parity condition leads us to choose the first option for `x`, which is `2 + p`.

6. **Final Values**:
   - The final value for `y` will be `n + |t|`, and `x` will be `2 + p`.
   - The `math.ceil` function will not change `y` as it is already an integer greater than `n`.

7. **Output State**:
   - Therefore, the output state will include the values of `y` and `x` as computed.

Output State: **`y` is `n + |t|`, `x` is `2 + p`**
