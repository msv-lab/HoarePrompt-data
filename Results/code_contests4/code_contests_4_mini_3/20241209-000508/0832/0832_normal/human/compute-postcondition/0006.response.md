Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n` * `m` and `k` ≤ `n - 1. If `k` is less than `n`, `y` remains 1, and the output printed is (1, k + 1), after which the program terminates due to sys.exit().***
