The variable `y` is assigned the value of 1. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n` * `m`; `x` is 1; `y` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n` * `m`; `x` is 1; `y` is 1**
