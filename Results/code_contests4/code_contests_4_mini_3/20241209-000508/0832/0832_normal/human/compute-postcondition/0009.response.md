The value of `p` is assigned the result of `k % (m - 1)`, where `k` is negative and `m` is unknown. Since `m` is not defined, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `p`. However, the operation `k % (m - 1)` will yield a value based on the modulus operation with the negative value of `k` and the unknown `m - 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is less than `n`, `k` becomes negative; `y` remains 1; `t` is calculated as `k / (m - 1)`; `p` is `k % (m - 1)` where `m` is unknown.

Output State: **`k` is less than `n`, `k` becomes negative; `y` remains 1; `t` is calculated as `k / (m - 1)`; `p` is `k % (m - 1)` where `m` is unknown.**
