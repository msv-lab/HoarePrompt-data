The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the values of `y` and `k + 1`. Given the initial state, `y` is 1 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ k < n * m` and `k ≤ n - 1`. Therefore, `k + 1` will be at least 1 and at most `n`. 

No variables are changed by this line of code; it simply outputs the values based on the current state of `y` and `k`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `y` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ k < n * m` and `k ≤ n - 1`, resulting in the print output of `y` and `k + 1`.

Output State: **`y` is 1; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n` * `m` and `k` ≤ `n - 1; print output is (1, k + 1)**
