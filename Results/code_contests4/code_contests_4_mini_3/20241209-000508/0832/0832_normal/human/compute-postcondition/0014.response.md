The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly within its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 (with `n` always being even), and `k` is a non-negative integer constrained by 0 ≤ k < n * m. The output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the parameter constraints alone, we cannot determine the specific return value or behavior of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters, but operates on the constraints where n and m are integers (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is even) and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k < n * m). The specific output behavior is not defined.**
