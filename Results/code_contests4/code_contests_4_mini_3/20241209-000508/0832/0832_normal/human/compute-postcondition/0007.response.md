The variable `k` is decremented by `n`. The initial state specifies that `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ k < n * m` and `k ≤ n - 1`. Since `k ≤ n - 1`, it implies that `k` is less than `n`. According to the conditions, if `k` is less than `n`, then `y` remains 1, and the output would be `(1, k + 1)` before the program terminates. 

After executing `k -= n`, since `k` is less than `n`, `k` becomes negative because we are subtracting a positive integer `n` (which is at least 2). This means that after this operation, the program will not print `(1, k + 1)` because it would have already terminated due to `sys.exit()`.

Therefore, the final output state reflects the values of `k` after the operation and the termination of the program.

Output State: **`k` is less than `n`, `k` becomes negative; `y` remains 1 and the program terminates.**
