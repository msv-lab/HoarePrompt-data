The code `sys.exit()` is called, which terminates the program's execution immediately. No variables are modified, and no values are returned other than the termination of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 1; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n` * `m` and `k` ≤ `n - 1; print output is (1, k + 1), and the program has terminated due to sys.exit().
