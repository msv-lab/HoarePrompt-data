The code prints the values of `y` and `x`. The initial state specifies that `y` is `n + |t|` and `x` is `2 + p`. Since no specific values for `n`, `t`, or `p` are provided, we cannot calculate exact numerical values for `y` and `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the expressions for `y` and `x` as they are based on the initial state.

Output State: **`y` is `n + |t|`, `x` is `2 + p`**
