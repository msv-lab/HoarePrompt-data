The function accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if `n` is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returns True if `n` is 2 or 3, returns False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, and uses trial division to check for factors of `n` starting from 5, incrementing by 6, until the square root of `n` is reached. If no factors are found, it returns True. Thus, the function accurately identifies prime numbers and handles edge cases correctly.
