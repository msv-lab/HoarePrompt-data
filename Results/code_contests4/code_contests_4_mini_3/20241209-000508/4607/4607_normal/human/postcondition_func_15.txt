The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and redirects standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It operates on a sequence of positive integers, but there is no logic implemented for processing these integers or returning any results. Therefore, the function's functionality is limited to setting up file redirection without performing any computations or returning values.
