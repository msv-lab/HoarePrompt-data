The function accepts no parameters and processes a sequence of positive integers. It first checks the count of integers; if there is only one integer, it calls `func_18` with -1 and exits. If there are two integers, it checks for equality and performs calculations based on their difference. If more than two integers are present, it computes the differences between consecutive integers. It returns results through multiple calls to `func_18`, including the count of unique differences, specific calculated values, or exits with zero based on the conditions met. If the differences are not uniform, the function may add a new integer to the list, which could influence the subsequent checks. If all conditions are met, it will either call `func_18` with the number of unique values or zero, depending on the uniformity of the differences.
