The function accepts a tuple `item`, where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by `n` positive integers. It returns the first positive integer from the tuple that follows `n`. If `n` is 1, it will return the only positive integer present in the tuple; however, if `n` is greater than 1, it will return the second element in the tuple. The function does not check for the validity of the input regarding the specified constraints.
