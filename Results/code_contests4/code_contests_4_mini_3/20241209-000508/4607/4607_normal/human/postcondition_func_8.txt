The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `m` of positive integers. It returns a list containing `n` lists, where each inner list contains the integer `num` repeated `m` times. The value of `m` is not utilized as a list to determine the count of repetitions; instead, the function always repeats `num` for `m` times given by the argument, which may lead to confusion regarding its intended functionality based on the annotations.
