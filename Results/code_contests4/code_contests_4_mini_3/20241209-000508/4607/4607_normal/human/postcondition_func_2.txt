The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user, returning a map object that contains the sequence of positive integers from that input, where each integer is converted to an integer type. The integers must follow the constraints that they are positive and do not exceed 10^8. However, if the input does not adhere to these constraints or if it is empty, the function will not handle those cases explicitly, leading to potential errors when processing the map object.
