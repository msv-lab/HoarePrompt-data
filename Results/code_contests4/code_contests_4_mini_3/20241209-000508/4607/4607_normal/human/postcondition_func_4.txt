The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`, which processes a sequence of positive integers on cards, where the number of cards, `n`, is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and the integers on the cards do not exceed 100,000,000. The behavior of `func_3()` is not defined here, so any specific details about the processing of the integers are not included in this summary.
