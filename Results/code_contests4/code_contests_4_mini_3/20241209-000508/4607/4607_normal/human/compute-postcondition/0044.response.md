`l` is assigned the value of `a[0] - (a[1] - a[0])`. Given that `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, and the number of unique elements in `g` is equal to 1, it indicates that `a` has a constant difference between its consecutive elements. Thus, `a[1] - a[0]` equals the common difference. 

Therefore, the expression simplifies to `l.append(a[0] - (d))`, where `d` is the common difference. This means `l` will contain one element calculated as `2 * a[0] - a[1]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; the number of unique elements in `g` is equal to 1; `l` contains one element equal to `2 * a[0] - a[1]`.**
