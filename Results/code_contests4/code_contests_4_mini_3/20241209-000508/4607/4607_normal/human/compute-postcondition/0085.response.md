The list `l` is modified by appending the difference between the elements `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. Since `a` is sorted, `a[i + 1]` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `a[i]`. This operation will increase the length of `l` by one. The values of `gc`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `a` is sorted, `x` is the last calculated value if the loop executed at least once, and `l` has one more element which is the difference `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.
