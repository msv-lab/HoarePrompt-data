Postcondition: ***`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the last calculated value, `l` contains `n` elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, and all elements of `l` are the same (i.e., `l` contains only one unique value).***
