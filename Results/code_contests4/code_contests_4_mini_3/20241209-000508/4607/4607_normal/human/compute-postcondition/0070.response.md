Postcondition: ***Given that `gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14` applied cumulatively to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, and `n` is at least 2 with `i` being 0, if the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not equal to `gc`, then `x` is assigned the value of `a[0]` plus half of the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, and `a` now contains an additional element which is `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`. The process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement at this point.***
