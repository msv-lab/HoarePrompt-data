The code `l = list(set(l))` takes the list `l` and converts it to a set, removing any duplicate values, and then converts it back to a list. Since `l` initially contains two elements, one equal to `2 * a[0] - a[1]` and the other equal to `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])`, and there are no constraints indicating that these values are necessarily unique, it is possible that they could be the same. 

The output state will reflect that `l` now contains only unique elements, but we need to account for the possibility that `l` may have reduced to one element if the two values were equal. Therefore, depending on the initial values of `a`, `l` could either have one or two elements after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` with only one unique value; `l` contains either one or two unique elements.**
