The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value of `a[0]` plus half of the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`; `a` now has one additional element which is `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
