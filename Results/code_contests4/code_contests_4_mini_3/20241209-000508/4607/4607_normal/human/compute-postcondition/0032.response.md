The value of `g` is a list, and the code appends a new value to it, calculated as the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, we are accessing the elements `a[2]` and `a[1]`. The previous value of `g` is the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, and now it will contain one additional element, which is `a[2] - a[1]`.

Since we know `n` is at least 2, and `i` is currently 1, it is implied that `a` must have at least 3 elements (to access `a[2]`), allowing the loop to execute a second time.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `g` with the new value appended.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `g` now contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`, `l` now contains the value of `g`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**.
