According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` contains more than one element, the loop can execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element of `args`, and since `at_start` is False, the loop has already processed the first element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must contain at least 2 elements. Next, `x` should be updated to the second element of `args`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`**
