The variable `l` has the element `a[2] - a[1]`, and the code appends a new element to `l`, which is calculated as `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. Given that `i` is currently 1, this means we are appending the value of `a[2] - a[1]` to `l`. 

The previous state of `l` is `[a[2] - a[1]]`, and after execution, the new state of `l` will be `[a[2] - a[1], a[2] - a[1]]`, assuming the values of `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[2]`) and `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) are the same as before.

The values of `gc`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the last calculated value, and `l` has become `[a[2] - a[1], a[2] - a[1]]`.

Output State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the last calculated value, and `l` has become `[a[2] - a[1], a[2] - a[1]]`.**
