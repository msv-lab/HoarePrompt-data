According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit set by `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. 

State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the last calculated value, and `l` has become `[a[2] - a[1], a[2] - a[1]]`**
