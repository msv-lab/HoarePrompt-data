The function `func_18` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. The function processes a sequence of integers on Alexander's cards, which consists of positive integers, each not exceeding 10^8. However, the specific output or return value of the function is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, based on the information given, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and processes a sequence of positive integers not exceeding 10^8. The specific return value is not specified.**
