Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element of `args` which has been written to `file` as a string. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` has also been written to `file`.***
