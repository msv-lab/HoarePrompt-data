According to the code, the loop will execute `n - 1` times, starting from `i = 0` and ending at `i = n - 2`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, since if `n` is 1, the range would be empty and the loop would not execute.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and is initially stated to be positive, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to run. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` is at least 2, `i` starts at 0, and the lists `g` and `l` remain empty.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `g` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list**.
