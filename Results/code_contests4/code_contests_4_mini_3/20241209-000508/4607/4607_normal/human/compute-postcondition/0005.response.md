The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The initial state indicates that `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, and `sep` is either a specified separator or a space (' '). The values of the other variables (`n`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element of `args`, and `sep` has been written to `file`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element of `args`, and `sep` has been written to `file`.**
