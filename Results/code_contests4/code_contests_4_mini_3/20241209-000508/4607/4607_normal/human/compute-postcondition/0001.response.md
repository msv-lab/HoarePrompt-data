The code assigns values to the variables `sep` and `file` by using the `pop` method on `kwargs`, which is a dictionary-like object. The `pop` method retrieves the value associated with the specified key and removes that key-value pair from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, it assigns a default value. In this case, `sep` will be assigned the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists; otherwise, it will default to a space (' '). Similarly, `file` will be assigned the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists; otherwise, it will default to `sys.stdout`. The values of `n` and the sequence of integers on Alexander's cards are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `sep` is either a specified separator or ' '; `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`.**
