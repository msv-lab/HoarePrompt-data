The variable `g` is assigned an empty list, which does not affect the existing values of `n` or `a`. The conditions regarding the calls to `func_18` depend on the value of `n`, but since no action is taken in the provided code snippet, the state of the program remains unchanged regarding those conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` is an empty list.**
