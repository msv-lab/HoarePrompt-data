The value `l` is a list that currently contains the values of `g`. The code `l.append(abs(a[i + 1] - a[i]))` will append the absolute difference between the elements at index `i + 1` and `i` in list `a`. Since `i` is 1, the calculation will be `abs(a[2] - a[1])`. The previous value of `g` (which is `l`) will now include the new value calculated.

Given that `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `a` is sorted, `a[2]` and `a[1]` will provide valid indices for the operation. The output state will reflect the updated contents of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `g` now contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, and the new value has been appended to `l`.**
