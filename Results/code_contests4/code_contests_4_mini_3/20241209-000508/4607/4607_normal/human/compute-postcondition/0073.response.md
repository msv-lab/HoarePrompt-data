The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is calculated as `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`. Given that `i` is 1, we will be using the values of `a[1]` and `a[2]` to compute this new element. The previous values of `gc`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; a new element is appended to `a` calculated as `a[1] + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**
