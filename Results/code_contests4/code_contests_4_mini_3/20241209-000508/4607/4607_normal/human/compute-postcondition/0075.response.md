Postcondition: ***`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not equal to `gc`, then a new element is appended to `a`, calculated as `a[1] + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
