The value of `i` is 0, and `a` is sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements (since `n` is at least 2). Therefore, `i + 1` is 1, and the expression `a[i + 1] - a[i]` computes the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list `a`. This difference is then appended to the list `g`. The state of the variable `l` remains unchanged as it is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `g` now contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `l` is an empty list**.
