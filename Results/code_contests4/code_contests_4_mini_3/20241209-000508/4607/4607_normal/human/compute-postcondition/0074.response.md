The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; a new element is appended to `a` calculated as `a[1] + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
