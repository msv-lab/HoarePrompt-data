Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`. If the number of unique elements in `g` is greater than 2, `func_18` is called with argument 0 and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues executing without calling `func_18`.***
