The code `l.append(abs(a[i + 1] - a[i]))` calculates the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` and appends this value to the list `l`. 

In the initial state, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, `a[1]` is the second element and `a[0]` is the first element in the list `a`. The value of `g` contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, which means that `abs(a[1] - a[0])` will equal `g`. Therefore, `g` holds the value that will be appended to `l`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, but the list `l` will now contain the value of `g`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `g` now contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `l` now contains the value of `g`.**
