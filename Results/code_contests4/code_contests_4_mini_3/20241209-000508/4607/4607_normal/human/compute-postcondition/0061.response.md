To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the effects of the code.

1. The variable `gc` is assigned the value of `func_14(gc, l[i])`. 
2. Before this line executes, `gc` holds the value of `l[1]`, which is the second element of the list `l`.
3. The index `i` is 2, meaning `l[i]` refers to the third element of the list `l`.

Now, since `func_14` is called with `gc` (which is `l[1]`) and `l[i]` (which is `l[2]`), the new value of `gc` will depend on the implementation of the function `func_14`, which is not provided. However, we know that `gc` will be reassigned based on the output of `func_14`.

Since the previous values of `gc` (which is `l[1]`) and `l[i]` (which is `l[2]`) do not change, we only need to mention that `gc` is now assigned the result of `func_14`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `gc` has been updated based on the function call, but we cannot specify the exact new value of `gc` without knowing the result of `func_14`.

Output State: **`gc` is updated to the value returned by `func_14(gc, l[i])`, where `gc` was previously `l[1]` and `l[i]` is `l[2]`.**
