The `sort()` method is called on the list `l`, which rearranges the elements of `l` in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `l` contains either one or two unique elements. Sorting will ensure that if there are two unique elements, they will be arranged in increasing order, while if there is only one unique element, `l` will remain unchanged. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `g`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` with only one unique value; `l` is sorted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` with only one unique value; `l` is sorted.**
