According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (since `range(n - 1)` requires `n - 1` to be at least 1). The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

Given that `gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14` applied cumulatively to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly, but it provides context about the state of `gc`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14` applied cumulatively to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0**
