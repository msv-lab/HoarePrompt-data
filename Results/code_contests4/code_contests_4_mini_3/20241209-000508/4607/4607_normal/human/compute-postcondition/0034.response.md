According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will run until `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented by 1. 

After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` would then be 2 and we need `i < n - 1`, which translates to `n` needing to be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
