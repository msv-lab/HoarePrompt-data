The loop calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` and stores these differences in the list `g`. It also stores the absolute values of these differences in the list `l`. The loop will execute `n - 1` times, where `n` is at least 2, resulting in `g` and `l` containing `n - 1` elements each.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `g` will contain the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, and `l` will contain the absolute values of these differences. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`.**
