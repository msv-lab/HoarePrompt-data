The code appends the value `a[i + 1] - a[i]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is currently 2, this means we will be appending the value `a[3] - a[2]` to the list `l`. The initial state of `l` is `[a[2] - a[1], a[2] - a[1]]`. Therefore, after executing the code, the new state of `l` will be `[a[2] - a[1], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`.

The values of `gc`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the last calculated value, and `l` is now `[a[2] - a[1], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`**.
