The function `func_17` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on a sequence of integers on Alexander's cards, which consists of positive integers that do not exceed 10^8. After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the logic applied to the sequence. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_17` is to process a sequence of positive integers and return a result based on that sequence, with the constraint that the sequence length is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and the integers themselves are positive and do not exceed 100 million.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and processes a sequence of positive integers, returning a result based on that sequence.**
