Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`; the number of unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1. If there exists at least one element in `l` that is equal to 0, the program exits without any changes.***
