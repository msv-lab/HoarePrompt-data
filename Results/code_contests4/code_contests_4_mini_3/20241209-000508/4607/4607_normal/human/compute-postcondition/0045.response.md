The code snippet `l.append(a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0]))` modifies the list `l` by appending a new value calculated from the elements of `a`. 

1. The last element of `a` is `a[-1]`.
2. The difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is `a[1] - a[0]`.
3. This difference is added to `a[-1]`, resulting in the value that will be appended to `l`.

Since `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and the number of unique elements in `g` is equal to 1, we can infer that the elements of `a` are evenly spaced.

Given that `l` originally contained one element equal to `2 * a[0] - a[1]`, after executing the code, `l` will now contain this original element plus the new value calculated.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` with only one unique value; `l` contains two elements, one equal to `2 * a[0] - a[1]` and the other equal to `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` with only one unique value; `l` contains two elements, one equal to `2 * a[0] - a[1]` and the other equal to `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])`.**
