Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element of `args`, and `sep` has been written to `file` if the loop is not at its start.***
