To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet:

1. The variable `x` is assigned a value based on the elements of an array (or list) `a`.
2. The expression `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` involves:
   - Accessing the element at index `i` of `a`, which is `a[2]`.
   - Accessing the element at index `i + 1`, which is `a[3]`.
   - Calculating the difference between these two elements: `a[3] - a[2]`.
   - Dividing that difference by 2 (using integer division `//`).
   - Finally, adding that result to `a[2]`.

Since we don't have the specific values of `a`, we cannot compute an explicit value for `x`. However, we know that `i` is 2, and `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` are being used in the calculation.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` is defined based on these calculations involving `a[2]` and `a[3]`, and the values of `gc`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is defined as `a[2] + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2**
