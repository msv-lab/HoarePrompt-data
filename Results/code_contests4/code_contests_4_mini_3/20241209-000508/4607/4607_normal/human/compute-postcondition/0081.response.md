Output State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `a` contains all original elements plus any additional elements added during the iterations, and `x` is the last calculated value if the loop executed at least once. If the loop did not execute, `a` remains unchanged and contains the original elements.**
