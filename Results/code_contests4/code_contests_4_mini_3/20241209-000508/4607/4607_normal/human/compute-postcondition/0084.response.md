According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. However, `l` is currently an empty list, which means that there are no elements to process within the loop body. If the loop is expected to be executed at least once and perform operations based on the elements of `l`, then `l` must contain at least one element. 

Thus, for the loop to execute properly, `l` should be modified to contain at least one element. The values of `gc`, `a`, and `x` do not directly influence the execution of the loop, but they might be relevant for the loop body if it were to operate on the elements of `l`. We will state the conditions necessary for `l`.

State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `a` is sorted, `x` is the last calculated value if the loop executed at least once, `l` is a list with at least 1 element**
