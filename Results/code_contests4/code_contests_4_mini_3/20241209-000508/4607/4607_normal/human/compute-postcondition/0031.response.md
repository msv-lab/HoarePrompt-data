According to the code, the loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2, which means that `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. 

At this point, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which means that `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `g` now contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `l` now contains the value of `g`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
