The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Given that `x` is the second element of `args`, its specific value is determined by the contents of `args`. The variable `at_start` is False, which indicates that the separator `sep` has already been written to `file` prior to this execution. 

The state of `n`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` are not directly modified by this line of code, but the value of `x` will be converted to a string and written to `file`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, and `x` has been written to `file` as a string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, and `x` has been written to `file` as a string.**
