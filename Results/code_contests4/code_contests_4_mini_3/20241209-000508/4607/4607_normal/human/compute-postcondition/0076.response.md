According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, which means `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

After the previous iteration, `i` becomes 2, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Hence, `n` must be greater than 2 (since if `n` were exactly 2, `n - 1` would equal 1, and `i` would not be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2**
