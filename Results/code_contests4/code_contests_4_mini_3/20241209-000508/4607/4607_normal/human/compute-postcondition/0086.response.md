According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, meaning that it has a minimum value of 2. The variable `i` has been incremented after the last execution, so for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 1 (the next value after the initial iteration at `i = 0`).

Since the loop will execute again, `i` will now be 1, and for the loop to execute more times, `n` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `l` has one more element which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, so when `i` is 1, `l` will include the next calculated difference between the elements of `a`.

State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the last calculated value, and `l` has the element `a[2] - a[1]`**
