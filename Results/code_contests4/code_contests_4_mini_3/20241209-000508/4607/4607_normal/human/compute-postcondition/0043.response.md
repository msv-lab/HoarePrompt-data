The variable `l` is assigned an empty list. The previous state of `l` had `n - 1` elements representing absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`, but now it is reset to an empty list. Other variables (`n`, `a`, and `g`) remain unchanged, and the number of unique elements in `g` still equals 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; the number of unique elements in `g` is equal to 1; `l` is an empty list.**
