According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `args`. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element. The current state indicates that `n` is an integer within the specified range, but it does not provide information about the contents of `args`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to establish that `args` contains at least one element. Additionally, the variable `x` will take the value of the first element in `args` during the first iteration.

Thus, to adjust the state for the loop to execute:
- `args` must be a non-empty iterable.
- `x` will be the first element of `args` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element of `args`**.
