The code initializes a new empty list `l`, which does not affect the previous values of the variables `n`, `a`, or `g`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the existing variables along with the new empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` is an empty list; `l` is an empty list.**
