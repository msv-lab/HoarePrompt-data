According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must increase by 1, making `i` equal to 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be at least 2, and `i` must be updated to 1.

State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2.**
