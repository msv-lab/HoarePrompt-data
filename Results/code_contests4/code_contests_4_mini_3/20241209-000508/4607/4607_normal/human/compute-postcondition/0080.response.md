Postcondition: ***`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not equal to `gc`, then `x` is defined as `a[2] + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and a new element is appended to `a` with the value of `x`, after which the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
