The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is at least 2. During each iteration, it appends the difference between consecutive elements of the sorted list `a` to the list `l`. After all iterations, `l` will contain `n` elements, which are the differences between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `a[2]` and `a[1]`, ..., up to `a[n]` and `a[n-1]`. The cumulative value `gc` remains unchanged as it is based on `l` after the loop execution, and `x` will reflect the last difference calculated.

After the loop executes, `l` will have `n` elements, specifically `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[n] - a[n-1]]`.

Output State: **`gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the last calculated value, and `l` contains `n` elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.**
