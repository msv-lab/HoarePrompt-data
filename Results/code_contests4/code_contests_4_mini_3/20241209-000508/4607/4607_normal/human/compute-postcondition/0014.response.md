According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, the loop can continue executing for each element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the second element of `args`, and since there are at least 2 elements in `args`, `x` has already been written to `file`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must now be the third element in `args`. Therefore, the next state should reflect this change. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, and `x` has been written to `file` as a string.**
