Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` with only one unique value; `l` is sorted; `func_18` has been called with the length of `l`. If there is only one unique value in `g`, the function will have called `func_18` with the length of `l`. If there are multiple unique values in `g`, then `gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the last calculated value, and `l` contains `n` elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of `a`. If all elements of `l` are the same, `func_18(1)` is called and the function is executed with the value of `x`. Otherwise, `func_18(0)` is called but does not modify any values or return anything.***
