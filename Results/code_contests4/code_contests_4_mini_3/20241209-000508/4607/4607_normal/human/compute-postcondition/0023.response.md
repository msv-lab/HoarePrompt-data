Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least `n` elements, and all elements of `args` have been written to `file` as strings separated by `sep`. A value has been written to `file` from `kwargs` or a newline character has been written if `end` was not present in `kwargs`. If the `flush` option in `kwargs` is True, the file's output buffer has been flushed. Otherwise, the output buffer remains unchanged.***
