The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `gc` is the cumulative value returned by `func_14` applied to all elements of `l` starting from `l[1]`; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is defined as `a[2] + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2; `a` has a new element appended which is `a[2] + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.
