The value of `at_start` is assigned to `False`, and since it was already `False`, there is no change in its value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `sep` is either a specified separator or ' ', `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, and `x` has been written to `file` as a string.
