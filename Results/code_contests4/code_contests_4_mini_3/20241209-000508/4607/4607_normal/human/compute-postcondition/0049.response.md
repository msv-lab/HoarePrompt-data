The function `func_18` is called with `*l`, which unpacks the elements of `l` as arguments to the function. The state of `n`, `a`, and `g` is not directly impacted by this call, but the function will operate based on the values in `l`. Since the output of `func_18` is not specified, the assumption is that it does not return any value or modifies any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the function call.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` with only one unique value; `l` is sorted; `func_18` has been called with the length of `l`.**
