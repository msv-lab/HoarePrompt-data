The function accepts an integer `x`, a positive integer `y`, and an integer `p`. It calculates the result of exponentiation by squaring, effectively computing `(x^y) % p`. The function will return the final result contained in `res`, which is determined by iterating through the bits of `y` and multiplying `res` by `x` whenever the least significant bit is 1. Note that `y` is treated as a single integer rather than a list, which contradicts the annotations claiming `y` is a list of integers. The function does not handle cases where `p` is zero, which could lead to a division by zero error in modular arithmetic.
