You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Everybody knows what an arithmetic progression is. Let us remind you just in case that an arithmetic progression is such sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an of length n, that the following condition fulfills: 

a2 - a1 = a3 - a2 = a4 - a3 = ... = ai + 1 - ai = ... = an - an - 1.

For example, sequences [1, 5], [10], [5, 4, 3] are arithmetic progressions and sequences [1, 3, 2], [1, 2, 4] are not.

Alexander has n cards containing integers. Arthur wants to give Alexander exactly one more card with a number so that he could use the resulting n + 1 cards to make an arithmetic progression (Alexander has to use all of his cards).

Arthur has already bought a card but he hasn't written a number on it. Help him, print all integers that you can write on a card so that the described condition fulfilled.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of cards. The next line contains the sequence of integers — the numbers on Alexander's cards. The numbers are positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed 108.

Output

If Arthur can write infinitely many distinct integers on the card, print on a single line -1.

Otherwise, print on the first line the number of integers that suit you. In the second line, print the numbers in the increasing order. Note that the numbers in the answer can exceed 108 or even be negative (see test samples).
