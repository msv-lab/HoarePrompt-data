To assess the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description
The task requires finding an integer that can be added to a sequence of integers such that the resulting sequence forms an arithmetic progression. 

### Analysis of Code
The main function `func_17()` processes the input and checks:
1. If there's only one integer, it rightly returns `-1` as you can't form an arithmetic progression with just one number.
2. If there are two integers, it checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it returns `1` and the number itself because adding that number again will keep it in an arithmetic progression. If they are not equal, it calculates potential integers using the differences and returns them.
3. For three or more integers, it calculates differences and checks if there are exactly two unique differences, which is a condition for forming an arithmetic progression with an additional integer.

### Edge Cases
1. **Single Element (n = 1)**: Handled correctly by returning `-1`.
2. **Two Equal Elements (e.g., [5, 5])**: Handled correctly by returning `1` and the number `5`.
3. **Two Different Elements (e.g., [3, 4])**: The code calculates possible integers based on the difference correctly.
4. **Three or More Elements**: The code checks the uniqueness of the differences. However, if the differences are not consistent, it will not yield a valid arithmetic progression.

### Output Hints
The output descriptions for the functions indicate various behaviors but do not explicitly show contradictions to the problem description. 

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the potential edge cases and how the code addresses them, no clear contradictions or failures in handling the requirements of the problem description are found. 

The code appears to correctly handle all specified cases as described. Therefore, based on the evaluation of the code against the problem description and the information provided in the output hints,

Correctness: **True**. 

The implementation correctly identifies the integers that can be added to form an arithmetic progression or returns a valid indication when it is not possible.
