Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem description regarding arithmetic progressions. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Lack of Main Functionality**: The program lacks a cohesive main function that drives the overall logic of determining what integers can be added to Alexander's cards to form an arithmetic progression. Functions are defined, but they do not seamlessly integrate to achieve the end goal.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Input and Output**: The program's functions for reading input (e.g., `func_1`, `func_5`) and outputting results (e.g., `func_18`) are not structured to handle the specific requirements of the problem description. For instance, while the program does read numbers from input, it does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the differences between the integers, nor does it find the valid integers that can be added to form an arithmetic progression.

3. **Missing Logic for Arithmetic Progression Check**: The program does not contain the required core logic that checks the differences between the numbers on the cards and determines the potential values to be added. Specifically, it does not check if the absolute differences between consecutive sorted integers are consistent, nor does it calculate the necessary values based on those differences.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program is not structured to adequately handle edge cases as described in the problem. For example, if only one card is present, it should return -1, but the way the functions are defined and used does not guarantee that this case is handled correctly.

5. **Return and Output Logic**: The final output logic in `func_18` does not align with the expected output format specified in the problem description. The expected output should include the number of valid integers followed by the integers themselves, but the implementation does not ensure this format.

Overall, the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described, leading to its classification as incorrect.
