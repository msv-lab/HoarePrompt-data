You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everybody knows what an arithmetic progression is. Let us remind you just in case that an arithmetic progression is such sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an of length n, that the following condition fulfills: 

a2 - a1 = a3 - a2 = a4 - a3 = ... = ai + 1 - ai = ... = an - an - 1.

For example, sequences [1, 5], [10], [5, 4, 3] are arithmetic progressions and sequences [1, 3, 2], [1, 2, 4] are not.

Alexander has n cards containing integers. Arthur wants to give Alexander exactly one more card with a number so that he could use the resulting n + 1 cards to make an arithmetic progression (Alexander has to use all of his cards).

Arthur has already bought a card but he hasn't written a number on it. Help him, print all integers that you can write on a card so that the described condition fulfilled.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of cards. The next line contains the sequence of integers — the numbers on Alexander's cards. The numbers are positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed 108.

Output

If Arthur can write infinitely many distinct integers on the card, print on a single line -1.

Otherwise, print on the first line the number of integers that suit you. In the second line, print the numbers in the increasing order. Note that the numbers in the answer can exceed 108 or even be negative (see test samples).

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a positive integer input by the user. However, it does not enforce any upper limit on the input, meaning the user can potentially input a value greater than 10^8, which contradicts the annotations. The function simply reads the input and converts it to an integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns the input sequence as a string. The string may represent a list of positive integers, each not exceeding 10^8, but it does not guarantee that the input is parsed or validated as a list of integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user, returning a map object that contains the sequence of positive integers from that input, where each integer is converted to an integer type. The integers must follow the constraints that they are positive and do not exceed 10^8. However, if the input does not adhere to these constraints or if it is empty, the function will not handle those cases explicitly, leading to potential errors when processing the map object.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object that converts a sequence of space-separated integers read from input into strings. It does not handle any invalid input cases, such as non-integer values or empty input, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`, which processes a sequence of positive integers on cards, where the number of cards, `n`, is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and the integers on the cards do not exceed 100,000,000. The behavior of `func_3()` is not defined here, so any specific details about the processing of the integers are not included in this summary.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function initializes a new thread to execute the `main` function, but does not accept any parameters or return a value. It sets a high recursion limit and stack size, which may allow for deep recursion or large stack frames if the `main` function requires it, but the specific behavior of `main` is not defined in the provided code.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a tuple `item`, where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by `n` positive integers. It returns the first positive integer from the tuple that follows `n`. If `n` is 1, it will return the only positive integer present in the tuple; however, if `n` is greater than 1, it will return the second element in the tuple. The function does not check for the validity of the input regarding the specified constraints.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of integers `l`, where the first element represents the number of cards followed by `n` positive integers. It returns the sorted version of the list `l` based on a specified sorting key provided by the function `getKey`. There are no checks for the validity of the input list, meaning if the first element does not accurately reflect the number of subsequent integers, the sorting may not behave as expected.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `m` of positive integers. It returns a list containing `n` lists, where each inner list contains the integer `num` repeated `m` times. The value of `m` is not utilized as a list to determine the count of repetitions; instead, the function always repeats `num` for `m` times given by the argument, which may lead to confusion regarding its intended functionality based on the annotations.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a list of positive integers `x` and evaluates the expression `not x and x & (x - 1)`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `x` is empty (by returning `True` if it is empty) or if it contains exactly one unique element (by returning `True` if all elements in `x` are the same and non-zero). If `x` contains more than one unique element, it returns `False`. Therefore, the function does not return the list `x` as indicated in the annotations.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly handles valid inputs within the specified range and does not account for any inputs outside this range or any non-integer types, but the input constraints ensure that `n` will always be a positive integer.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and returns a list of integers representing the individual digits of `n`. It does not handle any edge cases outside this specified range, as it assumes that `n` will always be a valid integer within the defined limits.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts an integer `x`, a positive integer `y`, and an integer `p`. It calculates the result of exponentiation by squaring, effectively computing `(x^y) % p`. The function will return the final result contained in `res`, which is determined by iterating through the bits of `y` and multiplying `res` by `x` whenever the least significant bit is 1. Note that `y` is treated as a single integer rather than a list, which contradicts the annotations claiming `y` is a list of integers. The function does not handle cases where `p` is zero, which could lead to a division by zero error in modular arithmetic.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts an integer `x` and a list `y` of positive integers. It repeatedly updates `x` with the last element of `y` and updates `y` with the result of `x % y`, until `y` becomes empty. The function then returns the last value of `y` before it became empty, which may not accurately reflect the initial value of `x`. This implementation does not handle the case where `y` starts as an empty list, which would lead to an error. Thus, if `y` is empty upon function call, a runtime error will occur instead of returning a value.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if `n` is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returns True if `n` is 2 or 3, returns False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, and uses trial division to check for factors of `n` starting from 5, incrementing by 6, until the square root of `n` is reached. If no factors are found, it returns True. Thus, the function accurately identifies prime numbers and handles edge cases correctly.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and redirects standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It operates on a sequence of positive integers, but there is no logic implemented for processing these integers or returning any results. Therefore, the function's functionality is limited to setting up file redirection without performing any computations or returning values.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_5()
    a.sort()
    if n == 1:

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts no parameters and processes a sequence of positive integers. It first checks the count of integers; if there is only one integer, it calls `func_18` with -1 and exits. If there are two integers, it checks for equality and performs calculations based on their difference. If more than two integers are present, it computes the differences between consecutive integers. It returns results through multiple calls to `func_18`, including the count of unique differences, specific calculated values, or exits with zero based on the conditions met. If the differences are not uniform, the function may add a new integer to the list, which could influence the subsequent checks. If all conditions are met, it will either call `func_18` with the number of unique values or zero, depending on the uniformity of the differences.

 Output decription for function18:  The function accepts a variable number of arguments, where `n` is an integer indicating the number of arguments (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). It writes these arguments to a specified output stream, separated by a specified separator (defaulting to a space), and ends the output with a specified end character (defaulting to a newline). If the flush option is set to True, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
