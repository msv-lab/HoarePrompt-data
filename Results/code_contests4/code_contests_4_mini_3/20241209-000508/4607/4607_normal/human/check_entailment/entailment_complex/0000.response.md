Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the following issues are present:

1. **Handling of Duplicates**: In the case where all cards have the same number, the output should be `-1` for infinite possibilities. However, the function `func_17` checks for duplicates only among the first two cards. If the first two cards are equal, it outputs `1` and the value of that card instead of recognizing that all cards are the same, which leads to an incorrect answer.

2. **Edge Case of Two Cards**: In the case of exactly two cards with different values, the code does not account for the possibility of inserting the number that would create an arithmetic progression between them. The logic for determining potential card values that could be added is insufficient.

3. **More than Two Unique Differences**: The code checks if the number of unique differences is greater than 2 and immediately returns `0`. However, it is possible to have a valid arithmetic progression with more complex scenarios involving more than two unique differences.

4. **Missing Output for Non-Duplicates**: The program does not properly handle cases where valid outputs are derived from differences between multiple cards, particularly when the differences lead to valid integers that could be added to create an arithmetic progression.

These issues suggest that the program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is false.
