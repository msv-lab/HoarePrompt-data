The function accepts an integer `x` and a list `y` of positive integers. It repeatedly updates `x` with the last element of `y` and updates `y` with the result of `x % y`, until `y` becomes empty. The function then returns the last value of `y` before it became empty, which may not accurately reflect the initial value of `x`. This implementation does not handle the case where `y` starts as an empty list, which would lead to an error. Thus, if `y` is empty upon function call, a runtime error will occur instead of returning a value.
