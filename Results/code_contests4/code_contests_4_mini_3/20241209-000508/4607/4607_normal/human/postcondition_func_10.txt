The function accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly handles valid inputs within the specified range and does not account for any inputs outside this range or any non-integer types, but the input constraints ensure that `n` will always be a positive integer.
