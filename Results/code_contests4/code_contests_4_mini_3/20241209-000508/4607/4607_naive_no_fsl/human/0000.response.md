To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles various cases of providing an additional card such that the resulting sequence can form an arithmetic progression.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. An arithmetic progression (AP) is defined such that the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
2. Given `n` cards with integers, the program needs to determine which integer can be added to these cards to form an AP.
3. If infinitely many integers can be used, the output should be `-1`.
4. If no integers can be used, the output should be `0`.
5. If there are valid integers, they should be printed in increasing order.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program starts by reading the input values and sorting the list of cards.
2. It handles special cases:
   - If `n == 1`, it outputs `-1` because any integer can be added to a single number to form an AP.
   - If `n == 2`, it checks if the two cards are the same and derives possible integers based on their difference.
3. For `n > 2`, it calculates the differences between consecutive cards and analyzes the unique differences:
   - If there are more than 2 unique differences, output `0` (not possible to form an AP).
   - If there is only one unique difference, it generates two potential integers (one before the first card and one after the last card).
   - If there are exactly two unique differences, it checks for a common divisor and attempts to find missing integers that could complete the AP.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. The program does not consider cases where there are duplicate values in the input cards. For instance, if the input is `[4, 4, 4, 4]`, it returns `0`, which is correct since no additional integer can create an AP with distinct values.
2. The algorithm might not handle cases where the input sequence is already an AP but has duplicates appropriately.

### Testing for Correctness:
Let's consider an edge case:
- **Input:** `3` followed by `1 2 3`
    - This is already an AP with a common difference of `1`. Adding `0` should be a valid option, as it would still maintain the progression (i.e., `0, 1, 2, 3`).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program logic and considering various test cases, including both regular and edge cases, the program seems to handle the conditions as specified in the problem. However, it is essential to ensure that it correctly identifies all potential integers that can be added and does not erroneously return `0` when valid integers exist.

Since we cannot identify a specific case where it fails given the clear handling for the majority of edge cases, we conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
