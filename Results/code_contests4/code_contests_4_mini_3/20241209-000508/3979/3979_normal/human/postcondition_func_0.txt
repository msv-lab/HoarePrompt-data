The function accepts two integer parameters `c` and `d` and returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`. It handles two cases: if `c` is non-negative, it returns `c / d`; if `c` is negative, it still returns `c / d`. The function assumes `d` is a valid non-zero integer, but does not handle cases where `d` might be zero, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `d` is never zero before calling this function.
