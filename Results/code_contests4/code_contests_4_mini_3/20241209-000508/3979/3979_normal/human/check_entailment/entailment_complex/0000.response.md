Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of bad cells that must be visited when moving from one square to another on an infinite checkered field, based on specific conditions for bad cells. However, the function `func_1` only performs division between two integers and does not implement any logic related to navigating the checkered field or counting bad cells.

Key issues:
1. The function is designed to return the result of dividing two integers, which is irrelevant to the task of determining the path and counting bad cells.
2. There is no implementation of the logic to identify bad squares based on the conditions given in the problem description.
3. The program lacks any form of pathfinding or distance calculation, which is essential to determine the minimum number of bad cells visited.

In conclusion, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
