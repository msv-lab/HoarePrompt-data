Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit when traveling from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) on an infinite checkered field, considering specific conditions that define bad cells.

However, the annotated program `func_1` does not address the problem at all. It contains a simple division operation that is unrelated to the task of navigating through a grid and counting bad squares. Furthermore, the variables `c` and `d` are not connected to the input parameters of `a`, `b`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, which are essential for determining the bad cells.

Additionally, the operations for identifying bad cells based on the conditions given (|x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a) and |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b)) are completely absent from the program. The program does not contain any logic for pathfinding or counting the number of bad squares visited.

In summary, the program lacks the necessary logic and functionality required to solve the problem as described, thus it is incorrect.
