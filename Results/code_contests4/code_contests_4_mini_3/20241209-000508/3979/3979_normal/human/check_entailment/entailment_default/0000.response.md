The provided program aims to calculate the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit while traveling from square (x1, y1) to square (x2, y2) on an infinite checkered field, based on certain conditions for "bad" cells.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. **Logic for Bad Cells**: The conditions for a cell (x, y) to be considered "bad" are given as:
   - |x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a)
   - |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b)

   The code appears to implement these checks by calculating the respective values for the start and end positions and then determining how many bad cells would be encountered based on the differences between these calculated values.

2. **Functionality of `func_1`**: The function `func_1(c, d)` is intended to return the result of the integer division of `c` by `d`. However, the way it handles negative values is misleading—it performs integer division but does not handle potential division by zero, which could lead to a runtime error if `d` is ever zero. The problem statement guarantees that the input values for `a` and `b` are at least 2, ensuring that `2a` and `2b` are never zero. However, this is a flaw in defensive programming.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Bad Cells**: The program calculates the number of bad cells by determining the difference in the results of the `func_1` calls for the starting and ending positions. It uses the `max` function to return the greater of the two counts, which seems to be a reasonable approach given the problem description.

### Output Hints Agreement
The output hints state that `func_1` handles division and mentions the potential issue of not handling a zero denominator. This aligns with the earlier assessment that the code does not include safeguards against division by zero, although such a situation cannot occur based on the constraints of the input values.

### Edge Cases
1. **Division by Zero**: If there were any possibility of `d` being zero, it would lead to an error. However, based on the problem constraints, `2a` and `2b` are guaranteed to be non-zero, thus this specific edge case should not arise in practice.

2. **Negative Coordinates**: The calculations for bad cells do involve absolute values, which should theoretically handle negative coordinates correctly, but the implementation needs to be explicitly checked against various combinations of positive and negative coordinates to ensure that the logic holds true.

3. **Boundary Cases**: While the program guarantees that the starting and ending squares are not bad, there may still be paths where cells adjacent to the route can be bad, and the program should effectively handle these routes.

### Conclusion
The code is overall structured to follow the problem description, but it lacks proper handling for potential division by zero, even if under the given constraints it will not occur. Given that the function does not follow best practices for robustness and safety, it can be considered incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation
The program does not handle cases where the denominator could be zero in a more general context, even though it is not expected to occur with the given constraints. Proper edge case handling and defensive programming practices are essential for correctness, and the omission of these makes the code fall short of being fully correct.
