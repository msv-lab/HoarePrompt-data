The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `c` and `d`. The parameter `c` is an integer, and the parameter `d` is also an integer. 

In Case 1, if `c` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`, where `d` is assumed to be a valid non-zero integer. 

In Case 2, if `c` is a negative integer, the function returns the value of `c` divided by `d`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `c` and `d`, returning the result of the division of `c` by `d`, with different behavior based on whether `c` is non-negative or negative. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `c` and `d`, returning the result of dividing `c` by `d`. If `c` is greater than or equal to 0, it returns `c / d`; if `c` is negative, it also returns `c / d`.**
