#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that the squares (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are not bad.
def func_1(c, d):
    if (c >= 0) :
        return c / d
        #The program returns the result of dividing c by d, where c is greater than or equal to 0 and d is not defined in the initial state but is assumed to be a valid non-zero integer based on the context.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are integers such that 2 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers such that |`x1`|, |`y1`|, |`x2`|, |`y2`| ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that the squares (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) are not bad. `c` is a negative integer.
    return c / d
    #The program returns the value of c divided by d, where c is a negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `c` and `d` and returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`. It handles two cases: if `c` is non-negative, it returns `c / d`; if `c` is negative, it still returns `c / d`. The function assumes `d` is a valid non-zero integer, but does not handle cases where `d` might be zero, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `d` is never zero before calling this function.
