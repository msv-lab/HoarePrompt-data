To analyze the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it adheres to the problem description and accurately calculates the minimum number of bad cells that need to be visited when moving from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).

### Problem Breakdown:
1. A square (x, y) is considered bad if:
   - |x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a)
   - |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b)

2. The program takes inputs `a`, `b`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, and is expected to output the minimum number of bad squares visited on the path from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).

### Program Analysis:
- The program calculates `aa` and `aaa` which represent the number of "bad cells" passed based on the condition involving `|x + y|`.
- Similarly, `bb` and `bbb` are calculated for the condition involving `|x - y|`.
- Finally, the output is the maximum of the differences between these values.

### Issues Identified:
1. The function `func_1` uses integer division which might lead to incorrect results, especially when `c` is negative, as Python 2's division behavior (assuming `raw_input` indicates Python 2 usage) can yield unexpected results.
2. The approach relies on computing the absolute differences for the bad cells based on the modular conditions without accounting for the actual grid traversal and does not guarantee the correct number of bad squares visited in all cases.

### Potential Test Case:
Consider the following scenario:
- Input: `2 2 1 0 2 1`
- According to the conditions:
  - The path from (1, 0) to (2, 1) should be checked.
  - (1, 0) is not bad, (1, 1) is not bad, (2, 0) is not bad, but (2, 1) needs to be evaluated.
- The conditions for (2, 1):
  - |2 + 1| = 3 which is not mod 4 (2 * 2)
  - |2 - 1| = 1 which is not mod 4 (2 * 2)
- Thus (2, 1) is not bad.
- The path could be (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1), which means 0 bad cells.

However, the program will output a value based on its incorrect logic which does not actually count the direct number of bad squares visited.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly compute the bad cells for all potential paths and relies on faulty logic that does not account for grid traversal, the output may not match the expected results specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
