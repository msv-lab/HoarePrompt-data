To analyze the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to understand both the requirements and how the program operates.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of bad cells visited when moving from a starting position `(x1, y1)` to a target position `(x2, y2)` on an infinite checkered field, where a cell is considered "bad" if it meets either of the two conditions based on the given parameters `a` and `b`.

The program reads the input values (a, b, x1, y1, x2, y2) and defines a function `func_1` that seems to compute how many "bad" cells would be encountered based on the position's coordinates. The key logic appears to be in the calculations of `ans1` and `ans2`, which are subsequently compared to determine the maximum of the two.

### Potential Issues with the Program:

1. **Division**: The program uses division (`/`) to calculate `aa`, `aaa`, `bb`, and `bbb`. In Python 2 (which `raw_input()` suggests is being used), this would perform integer division when both operands are integers, leading to truncation of decimal values. This could yield incorrect results when the positions result in a non-integer number of bad cells.

2. **Logic for Bad Cells**: The way bad cells are calculated does not seem to directly correlate with the problem statement. The problem states that a square is bad if it meets either of the two conditions, yet the program only looks at the differences and does not evaluate the actual path or the cells traversed. The calculations for `ans1` and `ans2` do not reflect the actual number of bad cells visited.

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider an example where `a = 2`, `b = 2`, `x1 = 1`, `y1 = 0`, `x2 = 0`, `y2 = 1`. 

- From the problem statement, we know that moving from `(1, 0)` to `(0, 1)` crosses `(0, 0)`, which is a bad cell since `|0 + 0| % 4 = 0`.
- The program might calculate `ans1` and `ans2` based on the differences of the coordinates but would fail to account for the actual cells visited on the path.

For the input `(2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1)`, the expected output is `1`. However, the program may not yield the correct result due to the reasons mentioned above.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, especially with the division operation and the logic used to determine bad cells, the program does not meet the necessary requirements for correctness.

Correctness: **False**.
