Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is incorrect:

1. **Understanding of Movement**: The problem states that islanders can only move statues from islands that are directly adjacent to the empty pedestal. The program lacks any logic that simulates or checks feasible movements of statues based on their adjacency to the empty pedestal.

2. **String Manipulation**: The program attempts to compare two lists of statues (`f` and `s`) after converting them to strings and removing zeros. This approach overlooks the crucial requirement of maintaining the adjacency rule for moving statues. Simply checking if the modified lists are equal does not account for the allowed movements as described in the problem.

3. **Invalid Assumption**: By just checking if `s` is equal to `f`, the program assumes that if they are the same after removing zeros, it means the statues can be rearranged to the desired order. However, this is not necessarily true, as the adjacency constraint can prevent certain statues from being moved into their desired positions.

4. **Example Failure Cases**: Consider the third example in the problem description:
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 0
     0 3 2 1
     ```
   - The program would incorrectly output "YES" because it does not account for the fact that the statue 1 cannot move to the last position as there is no adjacent empty pedestal available for the movement. The correct output should be "NO".

Thus, the program fails to adhere to the problem's constraints and requirements, leading to incorrect functionality.
