n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, ai is a list of n distinct integers where each ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1) represents the current statue on the i-th island, and bi is a list of n distinct integers where each bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ n - 1) represents the desired statue on the i-th island. Additionally, both lists contain exactly one zero, indicating the empty pedestal.
