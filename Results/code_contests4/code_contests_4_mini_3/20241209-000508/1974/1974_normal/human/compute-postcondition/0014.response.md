Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (between 2 and 200,000) and two lists of distinct integers `ai` and `bi` (both containing integers from 0 to n-1, with one integer being 0 in each list). It reads these lists as strings, removes occurrences of '0', and then checks if the modified second list `s` matches the modified first list `f`. It prints 'YES' if they are equal and 'NO' if they are not. However, the function does not explicitly return any values. **
