In this case, `f` is assigned the value of a string that is formed by adding a space character before and after the input received from `raw_input()`. The value of `n` does not affect this operation. Since `raw_input()` accepts an input string from the user, `f` will be a string that contains the user input surrounded by spaces. Therefore, the output state is that `n` remains an input integer, and `f` is a string that contains the user input with spaces.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `f` is a string that contains the user input with spaces.**
