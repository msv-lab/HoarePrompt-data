The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on two lists: `ai` and `bi`, which are defined within the constraints provided. `ai` and `bi` are both lists of `n` distinct integers, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000. Each list contains integers ranging from 0 to `n - 1`, with exactly one integer being 0.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but it can be inferred that it likely performs some operations based on the values in `ai` and `bi`, potentially involving the position of the integer 0 in both lists. 

Functionality: **The function operates on two lists `ai` and `bi`, which are lists of distinct integers ranging from 0 to n - 1, where n is an integer between 2 and 200,000, and exactly one integer in each list is 0. The exact return value is not specified.**
