You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice has got addicted to a game called Sirtet recently.

In Sirtet, player is given an n × m grid. Initially a_{i,j} cubes are stacked up in the cell (i,j). Two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. Player can perform the following operations: 

  * stack up one cube in two adjacent cells; 
  * stack up two cubes in one cell. 



Cubes mentioned above are identical in height.

Here is an illustration of the game. States on the right are obtained by performing one of the above operations on the state on the left, and grey cubes are added due to the operation.

<image>

Player's goal is to make the height of all cells the same (i.e. so that each cell has the same number of cubes in it) using above operations. 

Alice, however, has found out that on some starting grids she may never reach the goal no matter what strategy she uses. Thus, she is wondering the number of initial grids such that 

  * L ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ R for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m; 
  * player can reach the goal using above operations. 



Please help Alice with it. Notice that the answer might be large, please output the desired value modulo 998,244,353.

Input

The only line contains four integers n, m, L and R (1≤ n,m,L,R ≤ 10^9, L ≤ R, n ⋅ m ≥ 2).

Output

Output one integer, representing the desired answer modulo 998,244,353.

Examples

Input


2 2 1 1


Output


1


Input


1 2 1 2


Output


2

Note

In the first sample, the only initial grid that satisfies the requirements is a_{1,1}=a_{2,1}=a_{1,2}=a_{2,2}=1. Thus the answer should be 1.

In the second sample, initial grids that satisfy the requirements are a_{1,1}=a_{1,2}=1 and a_{1,1}=a_{1,2}=2. Thus the answer should be 2.
Program:
```
(n, m, l, r) = map(int, raw_input().split())

def func_1(a, b):
    if a > b:
        return a - b
    return b - a
if l % 2 and r % 2:
    o = (r - l) / 2 + 1
    e = o - 1
elif l % 2 + r % 2:
    o = (r - l) / 2 + 1
    e = o
else:
    e = (r - l) / 2 + 1
    o = e - 1
mod = 998244353
s = pow(o + e, m * n) + pow(e - o, m * n)
s %= mod
p = pow(2, mod - 2, mod)
print(s * p) % mod
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
