The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, where `a` represents the number of rows and `b` represents the number of columns of a grid. If `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns the difference between `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the function returns the difference between `b` and `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `a` and `b`, and return the absolute difference between them based on their relationship (whether `a` is greater than or less than/equal to `b`).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, returns the difference `a - b` if `a` is greater than `b`, and returns the difference `b - a` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
