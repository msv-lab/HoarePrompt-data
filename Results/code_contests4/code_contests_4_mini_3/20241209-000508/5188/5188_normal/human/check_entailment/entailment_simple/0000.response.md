Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the number of valid initial grids given the constraints on the height of the cubes in the grid cells (L ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ R) and the ability to perform specific operations to equalize the heights.

However, the function `func_1(a, b)` simply computes the difference between the number of rows (`a`) and columns (`b`) and does not address the requirements of counting the number of valid configurations of cube heights within the specified range [L, R]. 

The core logic to determine whether the heights can be equalized and how many valid configurations exist is missing entirely. The operations allowed and the constraints given in the problem are not reflected in the implementation, which makes the program incorrect. 

In particular, we can see that the operations to stack cubes in adjacent cells or in the same cell are not considered, nor is there any logic to count the valid configurations based on the limits L and R. Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem description in any way.
