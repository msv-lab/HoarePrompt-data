Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem is about determining the number of valid initial grid configurations for the game Sirtet, given certain constraints on the heights of cubes in the grid cells. However, the function `func_1` simply computes the absolute difference between the number of rows and columns of the grid, which is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

Here are the specific reasons why the program does not meet the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function is designed to return the absolute difference between the number of rows (`a`) and the number of columns (`b`). The problem requires a calculation based on the possible heights of cubes in the grid cells, not their dimensions. 

2. **Lack of Relevant Logic**: There are no operations or calculations in the function that relate to the values `L` and `R`, which are crucial for determining the valid configurations for the cube heights. The problem statement requires an understanding of how the cubes can be stacked within the bounds of `L` and `R` and how to utilize the allowed operations to achieve uniformity across the grid.

3. **No Output for Valid Configurations**: The expected output is supposed to be the count of valid grid configurations modulo `998,244,353`, but the function does not compute or return any such count.

In summary, the program does not address the problem's requirements at all, focusing instead on a completely unrelated calculation. Therefore, it is incorrect.
