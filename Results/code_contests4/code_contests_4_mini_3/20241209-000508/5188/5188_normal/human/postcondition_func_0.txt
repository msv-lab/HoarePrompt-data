The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent the number of rows and columns of a grid, respectively. It returns the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns `a - b`; otherwise, it returns `b - a`. The function effectively computes the difference regardless of which value is larger, ensuring a non-negative result.
