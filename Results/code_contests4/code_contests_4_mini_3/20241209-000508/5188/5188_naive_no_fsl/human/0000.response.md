Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. One notable issue arises when considering the bounds of L and R.

For example, let's take the input:

```
n = 2, m = 2, L = 1, R = 3
```

In this scenario, the valid heights for each cell range from 1 to 3. The possible combinations of cube heights in a 2x2 grid are:

- All cells at height 1
- All cells at height 2
- All cells at height 3
- Combinations like (1, 1, 2, 2) or (1, 2, 3, 3)

However, the program does not accurately calculate the number of valid configurations that can lead to an equal height across the grid. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that not all configurations can reach a uniform height using the allowed operations.

Moreover, the calculations using `pow(o + e, m * n)` and `pow(e - o, m * n)` do not align with the requirements of the problem where certain configurations may not be reachable at all based on the input constraints.

Thus, because there exist inputs for which the program will fail to produce the correct output, the correctness of the provided code is deemed **False**.
