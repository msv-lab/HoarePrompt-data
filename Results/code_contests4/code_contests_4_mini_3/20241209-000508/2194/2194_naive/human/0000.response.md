To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to rearrange the digits of a number `n` such that the resulting number is divisible by 25. A number is divisible by 25 if it ends in either '00', '25', '50', or '75'. If it's impossible to achieve this, the program should return -1.

2. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the number is already divisible by 25:
   ```python
   if int(s) % 25 == 0:
       print(0)
   ```
   This part is correct.

3. **Counting Digits**: The program counts the occurrences of the digits '0', '5', '2', and '7' in the number, which is relevant for forming valid ending pairs.

4. **Swapping Logic**: The program attempts to form valid pairs ('00', '25', '50', '75') through adjacent swaps. It does this by:
   - Finding '0's and calculating moves to position them correctly.
   - Finding '5's and '2's or '7's and calculating moves.

5. **Complexity of Conditions**: The logic is complex and attempts to cover various cases. However, it has a flaw:
   - It doesn't handle cases where the number of swaps calculated is not optimal due to ignoring some combinations of available digits.
   - It also does not consider the case where there might not be enough digits to form any valid ending.

**Potential Failure Case**: 
Consider the input `500`. The program should return `1` since the number can be rearranged to `500` with one swap (which is already correct). But if the input is `225`, the code does not have a straightforward way to handle it properly since it requires a swap of `2` and `5`, which the current logic may not optimally calculate based on its loops.

In conclusion, the program's logic is flawed, as it does not cover all edge cases efficiently and could lead to incorrect results. Therefore, I will state that the program does not meet the requirements as described in the prompt.

Correctness: **False**.
