The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Given that `j` is `i + 1`, this means we are replacing the character at index `i + 1` in `t` with the character at index `i`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the impact of this operation without changing the values of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `t` has the character at index `j + 1` replaced by the character at index `j`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]**
