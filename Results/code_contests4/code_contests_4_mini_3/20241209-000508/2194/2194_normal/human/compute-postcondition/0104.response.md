The variable `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. The previous value of `temp` is `t[i + 3]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, `t[j]`, and `j` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`; `ans` is `n - i + 2`; `t[j]` is updated to `t[i + 3]`; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 3] and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.**
