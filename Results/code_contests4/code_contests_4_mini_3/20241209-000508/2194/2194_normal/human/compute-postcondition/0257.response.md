The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The initial state does not provide the specific values of `t[j + 1]` or `j`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `temp`. However, the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the assignment of `temp` but does not specify its value.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]**
