The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of '0's found and shifted, and `t` has the elements from index `0` to `n - 1` shifted to the right by the number of '0's found.
