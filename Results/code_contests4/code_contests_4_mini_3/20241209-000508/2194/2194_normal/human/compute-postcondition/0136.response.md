According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop is designed to decrement `i` from `n - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. 

Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, for the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, if `n` is greater than `1`, the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 1.**
