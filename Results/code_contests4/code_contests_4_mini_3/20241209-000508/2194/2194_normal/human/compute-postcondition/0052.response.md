According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `i` values starting from `n - 1` down to `0`, which means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once. 

Given that `n` is already defined as a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Thus, the values of `i` and `n` are already appropriate for the loop's execution. 

At the first iteration, `i` will be `n - 1`, and the loop will iterate until `i` becomes `-1`. 

So the final state before the loop executes should reflect that `i` is initialized to `n - 1` and that the loop can execute since `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `i` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
