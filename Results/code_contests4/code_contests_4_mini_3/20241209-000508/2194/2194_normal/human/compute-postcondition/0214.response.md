The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `i` of `t` is '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
