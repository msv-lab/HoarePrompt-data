Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `s` is an input string representing `n`; `zero` is the count of '0' in `s'; `five` is the count of '5' in `s'; `two` is the count of '2' in `s'; `seven` is the count of '7' in `s'; `fin` is 1000000000000000000. If `zero` is greater than or equal to 2, then `ans` is the sum of the distances from the last '0' to its subsequent positions if found, `cnt` is 2 if at least one '0' was found, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `fin` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `ans`. Otherwise, the conditions for `ans`, `cnt`, and `fin` remain unchanged.***
