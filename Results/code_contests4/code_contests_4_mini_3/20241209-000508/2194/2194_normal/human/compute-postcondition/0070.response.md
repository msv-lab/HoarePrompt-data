The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The value of `j` is `i + 1`, which means `j + 1` is `i + 2`. Therefore, `temp` will be assigned the value of `t[i + 2]`. Since `temp` was previously assigned `t[i + 2]`, it remains unchanged after this assignment. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 2; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 2; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 1]**.
