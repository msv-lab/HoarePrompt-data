The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t` at index `j + 1`. Since `j` is updated to `j + 1`, we check that `j` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue executing. The value of `n` is greater than `i`, but the specific values of `t`, `j`, and `temp` are not provided. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' in `t`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is the value of `t` at index `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1` and it must be less than `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' in `t`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is the value of `t` at index `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1` and it must be less than `n - 1`.**
