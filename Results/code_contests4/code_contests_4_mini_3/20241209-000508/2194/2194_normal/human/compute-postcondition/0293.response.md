Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, with no leading zeroes; `s` is an input string representing the value of `n`. If `s` is divisible by 25, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, the program counts the occurrences of '0', '5', '2', and '7' in `s`, and determines `fin` as the minimum value between its initial value and `ans`. If `fin` is greater than 10^10, the program outputs -1; otherwise, if `fin` is less than or equal to 10, it outputs the value of `fin`.***
