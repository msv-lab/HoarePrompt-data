According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, which is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n - 1`, which implies `i + 1` must be less than `n - 1`, or equivalently, `i` must be less than `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 1; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 2]`; `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 1]`**
