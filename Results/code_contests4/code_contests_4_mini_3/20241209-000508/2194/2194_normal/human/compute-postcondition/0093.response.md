The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `j` is equal to `i`, and `t` is a list of characters, the character at index `j` is copied to index `j + 1`. The previous state of `t` is affected by this operation, as one of its elements is changed. The other variables remain unchanged, but we note the impact on `t`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i`, `t` has the character at index `j + 1` replaced by the character at index `j`, `j` is `i`, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` before the assignment.**
