The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1, `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, the first element of `t` is '0', and we break out of the most internal loop.
