Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `s` is an input string representing `n`, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `five` is the count of '5' in `s`, `two` is the count of '2' in `s`, `seven` is the count of '7' in `s`, and `fin` is the minimum value between its initial value and `ans`. If `fin` is greater than 10^10, the program outputs -1. Otherwise, if `fin` is less than or equal to 10, it outputs the value of `fin`.***
