The statement `t[j + 1] = t[j]` assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. This means that the value currently stored at index `j` of the list `t` will now be copied to index `j + 1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `temp` previously held the value of `t[j + 1]`, which will now be updated to the value that was in `t[j]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is now equal to the previous value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` now holds the value of `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is now equal to the previous value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` now holds the value of `t[j]`.**
