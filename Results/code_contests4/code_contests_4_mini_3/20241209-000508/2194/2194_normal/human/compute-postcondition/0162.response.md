Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to `n - 1 - i`, and if the element at index `i` of the list `t` is '7', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In the absence of an else part, the behavior is solely determined by the condition of the if statement.***
