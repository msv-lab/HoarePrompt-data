The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0 or greater, `j` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of '0's found and shifted, `t` has the elements from index `i` to `n - 1` shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, and the element at index `i` of `t` is '5', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
