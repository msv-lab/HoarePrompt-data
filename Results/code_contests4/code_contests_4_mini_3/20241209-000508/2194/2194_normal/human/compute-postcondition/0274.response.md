The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, reflecting the number of times the loop has executed. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but it increases by 1 due to the statement. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, `j` is equal to `i + 1` after the loop completes, the first element of `t` is '0', and if the element at index `i` of `t` is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
