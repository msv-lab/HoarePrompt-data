Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` as a string input and checks if it is divisible by 25, returning 0 if it is. If not, it counts the occurrences of the digits '0', '5', '2', and '7' in the string representation of `n`. It then calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to rearrange the digits of `n` to form a number divisible by either 100 or 25 using '0's and either '5', '2', or '7'. If the required swaps exceed 10^10, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the minimum number of swaps. The function does not accept parameters and the output depends on the specific properties of the input integer `n`. **
