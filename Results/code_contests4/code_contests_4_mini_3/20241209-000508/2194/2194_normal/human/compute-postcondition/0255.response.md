According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `i`, which is at least 0, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be less than `n - 2`, which means that `j` should be at least `i` and less than `n - 2`.

If `j` is currently `n - 3`, then it will increase to `n - 2`, which is the limit, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `2` and `j` should be `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the original value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[j + 1]` now equals `t[j]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be at least `i` and less than `n - 2` (for example, `j` could be `n - 3`).**
