`cnt` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables, `n` and `ans`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of the list `t`, which is equal to the number of characters in the input string `s`; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `t`, which is equal to the number of characters in the input string `s`; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is 0**
