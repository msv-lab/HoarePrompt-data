The assignment `t[j] = temp` sets the value of `t[j]` to the value held in `temp`. The variable `temp` is previously assigned the value of `t[i + 2]`, which means `t[j]` will now hold the value of `t[i + 2]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is equal to `t[i + 2]`, `t[j + 1]` holds the value of `t[j]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp` (which is `t[i + 2]`).

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is equal to `t[i + 2]`, `t[j + 1]` holds the value of `t[j]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `t[i + 2]`.**
