According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts iterating from `i` and continues until `n - 2`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n - 2`. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0,
- `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' from the end of the list `t` or -1 if '7' is not present,
- `ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed.

To ensure that the loop will execute:
1. `i` must be at least `0` (since indices cannot be negative) and less than `n - 2`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `2` (to ensure `n - 2` is non-negative).
2. If `i` is `-1`, the loop will not execute because `-1` is not less than `n - 2`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`,
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `2`,
- the value of `j` should start at `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `i`**
