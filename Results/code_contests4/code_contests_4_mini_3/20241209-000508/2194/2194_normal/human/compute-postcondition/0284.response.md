Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2. If `n` equals 3, then `i` is at least 0, `ans` is 1000000000000000, `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, `j` is equal to `i + 1` after the loop completes, and the first element of `t` is '0'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and not equal to 3, `i` is at least 3, `ans` is equal to the number of leading '0's in `t`, `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and the first element of `t` is '0'.***
