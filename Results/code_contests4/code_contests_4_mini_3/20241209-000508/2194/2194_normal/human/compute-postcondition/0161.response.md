The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to `n - 1 - i`, and the element at index `i` of the list `t` is '7' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
