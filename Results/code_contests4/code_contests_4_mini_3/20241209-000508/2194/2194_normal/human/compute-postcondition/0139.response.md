According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the current value of `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n - 1` and decrements down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which means the next iteration will have `i` decreased by 1, making it `n - 3`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Since `n` is greater than `0`, `i` will be valid for at least one more iteration. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 3`. The condition involving `t[i]` does not affect the ability of the loop to execute again since it leads to a break, but it is still relevant to note that during the next iteration, `t[n - 3]` will need to be checked.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, for the loop to execute a next time `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
