The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. This means that the value at index `j + 1` in the array `t` is now the same as the value at index `j`. The previous state of the affected variables indicates that `temp` was assigned a value from `t[j + 1]` before this assignment, but since `t[j + 1]` is now being updated to be equal to `t[j]`, `temp` will hold the original value of `t[j + 1]`, which is now replaced. Other variables `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the original value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` now equals `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the original value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` now equals `t[j]`**.
