The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on a positive integer `n` that is between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, with no leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the value of `n`. The specific output behavior based on the value of `n` has not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to work with a positive integer `n` within the specified range and return a result based on that integer.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates on a positive integer n between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, with no leading zeroes, returning a result based on that integer.**
