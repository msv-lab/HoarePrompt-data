The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is between 0 and `n - 4`, `ans` is `n`, `t` has the characters from index `i + 1` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position, and the first character of `t` is '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
