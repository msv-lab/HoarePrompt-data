Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2; `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`; `ans` is either 1000000000000000 if `n` equals 3 or equal to the number of leading '0's plus `n - 2` if `n` is greater than 3; `t` has the characters from index `i` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position, with the first character of `t` as '0' in both cases.***
