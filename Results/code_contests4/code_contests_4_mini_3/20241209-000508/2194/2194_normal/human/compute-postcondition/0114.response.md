`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is `n - 2`, so after execution, `ans` becomes `n - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - 1`, `t` has the characters from index `i` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position, the first character of `t` is '0', and if the character at index `i` of `t` is not '0', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
