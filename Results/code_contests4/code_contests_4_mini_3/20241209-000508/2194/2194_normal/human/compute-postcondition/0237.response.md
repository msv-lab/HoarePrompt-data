The variable `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. The value of `temp` was previously assigned to `t[j + 1]`, which was updated to the value of `t[j]`. Therefore, `t[j]` now holds the value that was originally in `t[j + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is assigned the value `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`; `t[j]` is now equal to the original value of `t[j + 1]`.**
