The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. Given that `j` is `i + 1`, this means `temp` is assigned the value of `t[i + 2]`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `t`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `t` has the character at index `j + 1` replaced by the character at index `j`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `t` has the character at index `j + 1` replaced by the character at index `j`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]`**
