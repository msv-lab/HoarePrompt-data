`cnt` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `cnt` was initially 0, it will now be 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `i` is `n - 1**
