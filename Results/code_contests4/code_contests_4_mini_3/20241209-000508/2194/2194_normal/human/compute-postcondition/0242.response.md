Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0 or greater, `j` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of '0's found and shifted, and `t` has the elements from index `i` to `n - 1` shifted to the right by the number of '0's found. If the element at index `i` of `t` is '5', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
