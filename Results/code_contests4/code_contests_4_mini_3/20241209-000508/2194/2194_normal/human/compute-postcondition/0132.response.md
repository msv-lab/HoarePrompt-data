According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, as the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. Additionally, at the end of the loop's first iteration, the variable `i` will be `n - 1`.

Based on the provided state, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The current state of other variables does not affect the ability of the loop to run.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time**
