The value of `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. The variable `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and since `i` is at least 0, `j` will be at least 2. The specific values of `n`, `i`, and `temp` are not provided, but the assignment of `t[j]` does not impact other variables except for `t` at index `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.**
