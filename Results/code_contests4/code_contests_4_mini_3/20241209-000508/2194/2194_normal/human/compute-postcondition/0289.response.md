Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `s` is an input string representing `n`; `zero` is the count of '0' in `s'; `five` is the count of '5' in `s'; `two` is the count of '2' in `s'; `seven` is the count of '7' in `s'; `fin` is less than or equal to `10^10`; `i` is at least 3 or at least 0; `ans` is either 1000000000000000 or the number of leading '0's in `t`; `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; the first element of `t` is '0'. The program executes a print statement that outputs -1.**
