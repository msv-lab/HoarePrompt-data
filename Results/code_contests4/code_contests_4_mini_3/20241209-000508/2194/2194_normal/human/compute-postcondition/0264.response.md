The value of `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. Given that `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, this means that `t[j]` will now hold the value that was previously in `t[j + 1]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `temp`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is at least 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `t[j]` now holds the value of `t[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is at least 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `t[j]` now holds the value of `t[j + 1]**.
