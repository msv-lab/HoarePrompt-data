The code `ans += n - 1 - i` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `n - 1 - i` to the current value of `ans`. 

Given that `i` is defined as `n - 2`, we can substitute `i` in the expression:

1. Start with `i = n - 2`.
2. Therefore, `n - 1 - i` becomes `n - 1 - (n - 2)`, which simplifies to `n - 1 - n + 2 = 1`.
3. Hence, `ans` is incremented by `1`.

Since the initial state indicates that `n` is greater than `0`, this operation will always result in `ans` being incremented by `1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this computation. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
