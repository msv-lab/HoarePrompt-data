Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `s` is an input string representing `n`; `zero` is the count of '0' in `s'; `five` is the count of '5' in `s'; `two` is the count of '2' in `s'; `seven` is the count of '7' in `s'; `fin` is 1000000000000000000. If `two` is at least 1 and `five` is at least 1, `fin` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`. If the conditions are not met, the values of `ans`, `cnt`, and `fin` remain unchanged.***
