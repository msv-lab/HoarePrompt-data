The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The code then assigns the value of `temp` to `t[j]`, effectively making `t[j]` equal to the original value of `t[j + 1]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `t[j + 1]`) remain unchanged, except for `t[j]` which now holds the value that was previously in `t[j + 1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` holds the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` holds the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]**
