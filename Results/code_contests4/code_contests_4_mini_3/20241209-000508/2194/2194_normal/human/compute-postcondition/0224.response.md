The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is not provided, so we cannot determine its specific new value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `ans` only.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1, for the loop to execute the first time, if `i` is -1 then `n` must be greater than 1, if `i` is valid then `i` must be less than `n - 1`, and `j` is initialized to `i`; `ans` is increased by 1**.
