The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1, so after execution, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 2; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 2]`; `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 2; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 2]`; `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 1]**
