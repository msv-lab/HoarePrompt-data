The statement `t[j + 1] = t[j]` assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. This means the element at index `j + 1` in the list `t` will now hold the same value as the element at index `j`. The initial states of the variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` are not directly affected by this assignment, but the state of the list `t` will change. The specific values of `t[j]` and `t[j + 1]` are not provided, so we cannot determine their actual values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` now holds the value of `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` now holds the value of `t[j]`.**
