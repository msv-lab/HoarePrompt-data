The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. Given that `j` is `i + 1`, we can express this as `temp = t[i + 2 + 1]` or `temp = t[i + 3]`. The variable `temp` takes on the value from the array `t` at the index `i + 3`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, `t[j]`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `t[j]` is updated to `t[i + 2]`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 3]`, and `i` must be less than `n - 3` for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `t[j]` is updated to `t[i + 2]`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 3]`, and `i` must be less than `n - 3` for the loop to execute a second time.**
