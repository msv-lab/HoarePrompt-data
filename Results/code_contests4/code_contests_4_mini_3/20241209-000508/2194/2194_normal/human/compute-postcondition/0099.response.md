The variable `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. The value of `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, which means we need to look at the character in `t` at the index `i + 2`. The variable `j` is `i + 1`, so `t[j]` corresponds to `t[i + 1]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `t[j]`, which will be updated to `temp`, and `temp` is `t[i + 2]`. Since `n` is at least 2 and `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, we have valid indices for accessing `t`. The output state reflects the change in `t` at index `j`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `t[j]` is updated to `t[i + 2]`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]**
