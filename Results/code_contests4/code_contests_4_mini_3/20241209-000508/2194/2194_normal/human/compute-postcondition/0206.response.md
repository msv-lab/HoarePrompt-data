Output State: **`fin` is updated to the minimum value between its current state and `ans`, where `ans` is either 1000000000000000 or the number of consecutive '0's from the start of `t` depending on the value of `n`. The state of `t` remains the modified list after all swaps or unchanged if the loop did not execute.**
