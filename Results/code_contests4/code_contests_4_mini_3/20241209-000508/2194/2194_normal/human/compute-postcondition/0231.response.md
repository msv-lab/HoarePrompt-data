The operation `t[j + 1] = t[j]` assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. This means that the value at the index `j + 1` in the list `t` will now be equal to the value at index `j`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `j` is already updated to `j + 1` before this line, indicating that we are working with the next index.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` before this line, and now `t[j + 1]` is set to the value of `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` before this line, and now `t[j + 1]` is set to the value of `t[j]`.**
