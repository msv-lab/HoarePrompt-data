In the provided code snippet, `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. The variable `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and since `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `j` will be at least 2 and at most `n + 1`. The value of `temp` is `t[j + 1]` before this assignment, but it will change after the assignment is executed. 

After the assignment, `t[j + 1]` will have the same value as `t[j]`. The output state will not provide specific values for `t` or `temp` since they are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.**
