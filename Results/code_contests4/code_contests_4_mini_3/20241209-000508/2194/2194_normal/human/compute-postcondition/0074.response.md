The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is 2, so after the execution, `ans` becomes 3. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `temp`, `t`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 2]**
