`ans` is incremented by the value of `n - 2 - i`. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, so we can substitute `i` in the expression: `n - 2 - i` becomes `n - 2 - (n - 3)` which simplifies to `n - 2 - n + 3`, resulting in `1`. Therefore, `ans` is increased by `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is increased by 1**
