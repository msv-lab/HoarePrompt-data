The variable `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, which is the value of `t` at index `j + 1`. The previous value of `t[j + 1]` is unchanged, and `temp` holds the value of `t[j + 1]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' in `t` (or -1 if '5' is not present); `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is the value of `t` at index `j + 1`; `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`.
