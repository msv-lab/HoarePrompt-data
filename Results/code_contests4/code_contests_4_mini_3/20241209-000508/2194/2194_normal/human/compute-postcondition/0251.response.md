The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, and `ans` is increased by 1**.
