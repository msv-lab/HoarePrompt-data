According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and the loop's range. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and `i` is at least 0. Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 2` is at least 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes `j + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than `n - 2`. This means `i` should be at most `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` holds the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `j` is now equal to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.**
