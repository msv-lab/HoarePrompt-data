The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` based on the previous value of `t[j]`. The line `t[j] = temp` means that the value of `t[j]` is now updated to be equal to `t[j + 1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1; `j` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`; `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`.
