The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
