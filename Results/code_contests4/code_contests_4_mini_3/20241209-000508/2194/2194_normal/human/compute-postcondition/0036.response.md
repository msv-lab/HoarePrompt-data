According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined in `xrange(n - 1, -1, -1)`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

So, `i` will be `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0, which requires that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 (since `n - 3` must be at least 0).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
