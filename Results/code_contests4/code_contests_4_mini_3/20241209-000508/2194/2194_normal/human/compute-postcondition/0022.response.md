The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `ans`, and `i` are not affected. Since `cnt` was initially 1, after executing the code, `cnt` becomes 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is -1, `cnt` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is -1, `cnt` is 2, `i` is `n - 1**
