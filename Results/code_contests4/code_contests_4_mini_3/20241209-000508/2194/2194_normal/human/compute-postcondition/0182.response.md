The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The previous state indicates that `j` is `i + 1`, which means `temp` takes the value of `t[i + 2]`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `t[j + 1]` holds the value of `t[j]`, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, and `temp` is equal to `t[i + 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is equal to `t[i + 2]`, `t[j + 1]` holds the value of `t[j]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`.**
