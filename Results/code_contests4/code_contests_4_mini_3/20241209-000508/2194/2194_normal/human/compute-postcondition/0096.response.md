The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is `n - i`. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will be `n - i + 1`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `t` has the character at index `j + 1` replaced by the character at index `j`, `j` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `i + 3**
