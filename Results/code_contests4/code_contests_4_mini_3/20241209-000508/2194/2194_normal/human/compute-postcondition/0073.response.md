According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate while `j` is in the range from `i` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n - 1`, which means `j` can take the value of `i` and will increase with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Currently, `j` is set to `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, so after the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 2`. For the loop to execute once more, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 2, `j` is `i + 2`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 2]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**
