The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is not specified. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1**
