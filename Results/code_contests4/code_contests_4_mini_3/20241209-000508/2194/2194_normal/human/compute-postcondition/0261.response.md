The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `ans` is not provided, but it is stated that `ans` is already increased by 1 prior to this operation. Therefore, after executing this line, `ans` will be at least 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `temp`, and `j`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is at least 2, `temp` holds the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `j` is now equal to `i + 1`.**
