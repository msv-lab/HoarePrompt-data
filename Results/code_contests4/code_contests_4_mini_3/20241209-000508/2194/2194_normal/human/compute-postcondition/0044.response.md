Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is `n - 3`. If `t[i]` equals '0' and `cnt` is 0, then `ans` is increased by 2 and `cnt` is increased by 1. If `cnt` equals 1, then `ans` is increased by 1, `cnt` is increased by 1, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt` is not equal to 1, there are no changes to `ans` or `cnt`.***
