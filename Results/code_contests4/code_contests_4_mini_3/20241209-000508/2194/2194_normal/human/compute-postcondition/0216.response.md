According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` to `0`, decrementing `i` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1, making it `n - 2`. 

Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be `n - 2` for the loop to execute again. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `s` is a non-empty string. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `0`.**
