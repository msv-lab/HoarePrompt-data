`ans` is incremented by 1, and since `ans` is initially `n`, which is greater than 3, after execution, `ans` will be `n + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is between 0 and `n - 4`, `ans` is `n + 1`, and `t` has the characters from index `i + 1` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position with the first character of `t` being '0'. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is between 0 and `n - 4`, `ans` is `n + 1`, and `t` has the characters from index `i + 1` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position with the first character of `t` being '0'.**
