The variable `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. The value of `j` was initialized to `i`, which can be either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1. Therefore, `j + 1` can be either the index after the last '0' or 0 if `i` is -1. Consequently, `t[j + 1]` will take the value of `t[j]`, which depends on the value of `i`.

If `i` is -1, then `j` is -1, and `t[0]` will be assigned the value of `t[-1]`. If `i` is a valid index, then `t[j + 1]` will be assigned the value of `t[i]`.

Since we don't have the specific content of `t`, we will state the outcome based on the possible cases for `j` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`; `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1; `j` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` based on the previous value of `t[j]`.**
