The expression `ans += n - 1 - i` updates the value of `ans`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, we can simplify the expression:

1. The current value of `i` is `n - 1`.
2. Therefore, `n - 1 - i` equals `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, which is `0`.
3. This means `ans` will remain unchanged since `ans += 0` does not alter its value.

So, after executing the code, the values of the variables are:
- `n` is greater than 0,
- `ans` remains 0,
- `cnt` is 0,
- `i` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`**.
