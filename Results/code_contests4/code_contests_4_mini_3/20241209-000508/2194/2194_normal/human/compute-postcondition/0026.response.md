Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `cnt` was initially 0, then `cnt` is updated to 1 and `i` remains `n - 1`. If `cnt` was initially 1, then `ans` is set to -1, `cnt` is updated to 2, and `i` remains `n - 1`. If `cnt` was greater than 1, the values of `ans`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
