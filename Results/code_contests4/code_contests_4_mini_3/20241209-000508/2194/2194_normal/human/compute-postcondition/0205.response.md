Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0. If the first element of `t` is '0' and `n` equals 3, then `i` is -1 or greater, `ans` is 1000000000000000, and `t` is the modified list after all swaps or unchanged if the loop did not execute. If `n` is not equal to 3, then `i` is less than or equal to `n - 3`, `ans` is the number of consecutive '0's from the start of `t`, and `t` remains the modified list after all swaps or unchanged if the loop did not execute.***
