Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is between 0 and `n - 4`, `ans` is `n`, and `t` has the characters from index `i + 1` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position with the first character of `t` being '0'. If the character at index `i` of `t` is not '0', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
