The variable `ans` is assigned the value `10 ** 15`, which calculates to `1000000000000000`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is equal to 3; `i` is between 0 and 1; `ans` is 1000000000000000; `t` has the characters from index `i` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position, with the first character of `t` as '0'.

Output State: **`n` is equal to 3; `i` is between 0 and 1; `ans` is 1000000000000000; `t` has the characters from index `i` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position, with the first character of `t` as '0'.**
