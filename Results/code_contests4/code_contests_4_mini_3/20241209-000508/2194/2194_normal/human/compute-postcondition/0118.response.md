`ans` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is `n - 1`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is between 0 and `n - 3`, `ans` is `n`, `t` has the characters from index `i + 1` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position, the first character of `t` is '0', and if the character at index `i` of `t` is not '0', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
