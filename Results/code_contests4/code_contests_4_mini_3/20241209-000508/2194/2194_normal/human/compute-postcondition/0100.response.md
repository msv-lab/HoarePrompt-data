According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, which means that `j` is currently equal to `i` and can take on the values from `i` to `n - 3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by 1. So, if `j` is currently equal to `i`, then for the loop to execute again, `j` must be at least `i + 1`, which will also be less than `n - 2`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

- `j` will be `i + 1`.
- The loop can continue executing as long as `j` is still less than `n - 2`, which means `j` must be less than `n - 2` or `i + 1 < n - 2`, which simplifies to `i < n - 3`.

Thus, the states should be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `t[j]` is updated to `t[i + 2]`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n - 2` so `i` must be less than `n - 3`.**
