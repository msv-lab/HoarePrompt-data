The variable `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `j` is `i + 1`, the assignment means `t[i + 2]` (which is `t[j]`) will be copied to `t[i + 3]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 2; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 2]`; `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.
