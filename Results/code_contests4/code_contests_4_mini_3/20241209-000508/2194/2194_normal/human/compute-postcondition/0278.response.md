The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, which means we add 1 to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1, `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, the first element of `t` is '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
