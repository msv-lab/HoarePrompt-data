According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined in the for loop. The loop starts at `i = n - 2` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. 

Since `i` is currently `n - 3`, decrementing it will result in `i` being `n - 4`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` remains greater than or equal to `-1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `n - 4`, and since `n` is at least 2, `n - 4` will be at least `-2`. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 4`, and `ans` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
