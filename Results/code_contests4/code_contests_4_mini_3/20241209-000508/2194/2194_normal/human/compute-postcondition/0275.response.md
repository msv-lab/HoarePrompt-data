According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 3, allowing the loop to execute. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1 after the current iteration, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n - 3`, which means `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1, `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, the first element of `t` is '0', and if the element at index `i` of `t` is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
