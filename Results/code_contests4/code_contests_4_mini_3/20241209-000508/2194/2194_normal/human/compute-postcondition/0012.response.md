The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The value of `n`, which is the length of the list `t` and equal to the number of characters in the input string `s`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the length of the list `t`, which is equal to the number of characters in the input string `s`; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `t`, which is equal to the number of characters in the input string `s`; `ans` is 0**
