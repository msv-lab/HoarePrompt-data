The code `t[j] = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `t[j]`. The value of `temp` is derived from `t[i + 2]` based on the initial state. Since `j` is `i + 1`, we can also represent `j` in terms of `i`. Therefore, `t[j]` will take the value of `t[i + 2]`.

The other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

The Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 2; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 2]`; `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 2; `j` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `t[i + 2]`; `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 2]**.
