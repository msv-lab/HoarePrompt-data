The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. This means that the element at index `j + 1` in the list `t` will now take the value of the element at index `j`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `temp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is assigned the value `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.
