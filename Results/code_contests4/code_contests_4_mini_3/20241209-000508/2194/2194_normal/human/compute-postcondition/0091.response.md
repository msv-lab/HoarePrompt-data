The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is `n - 1 - i`, so after execution, `ans` becomes `n - 1 - i + 1`, which simplifies to `n - i`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i`, `t` is the list of characters after the swaps, `j` is `i`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i`, `t` is the list of characters after the swaps, `j` is `i`**
