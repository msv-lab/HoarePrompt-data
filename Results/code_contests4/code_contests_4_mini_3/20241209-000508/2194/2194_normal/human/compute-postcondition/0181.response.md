The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but since it is increased, the new value of `ans` will be the previous value plus 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, `temp`, `t`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is now equal to the previous value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[j + 1]` now holds the value of `t[j]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, `j` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is now equal to the previous value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[j + 1]` now holds the value of `t[j]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, `j` is `i + 1.**
