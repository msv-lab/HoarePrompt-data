The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `t` is the modified list after all swaps or unchanged if the loop did not execute, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
