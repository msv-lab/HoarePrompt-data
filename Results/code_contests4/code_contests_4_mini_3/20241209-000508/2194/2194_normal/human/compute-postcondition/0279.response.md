According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 4, we can deduce that `n - 3` is greater than 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again. 

In this case, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, resulting in `i` being 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 5 (because `i` must be less than `n - 3` which means `n` must be greater than `i + 3`).

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1, `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, the first element of `t` is '0', for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 5**
