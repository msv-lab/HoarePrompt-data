The value of `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. The variable `temp` holds the value of `t` at index `j + 1`. Since `j` has been incremented by 1, `t[j]` is updated to the value that was previously at `t[j + 1]`. This affects the value of `t` at index `j`, but does not directly impact the values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, or `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' in `t`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is the value of `t` at index `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1` and it must be less than `n - 1`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' in `t`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is the value of `t` at index `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1` and it must be less than `n - 1`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.**
