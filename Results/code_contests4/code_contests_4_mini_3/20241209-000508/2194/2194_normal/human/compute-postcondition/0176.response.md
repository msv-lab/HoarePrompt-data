The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is not specified but is stated to have been increased previously, so it is now at least 1 more than its prior value. The states of the other variables, `n`, `i`, `temp`, and `j`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `j` is now `j + 1` and must be less than `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `j` is now `j + 1` and must be less than `n - 2.**
