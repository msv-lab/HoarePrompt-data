According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from `n - 2` down to `0`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index in this range, which is either `0` or greater. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is decremented by 1. 

If `i` is currently `0`, the loop will not execute again because the next value of `i` would be `-1`, which is outside the valid range. However, if `i` is greater than `0`, the loop can execute again with a new value of `i` which will be `i - 1`.

Considering that `j` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of '0's found and shifted, and `t` contains the elements shifted to the right, we can summarize the state:

If `i` was `1`, `t` will remain unchanged, and `ans` will be the same. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to `0`.

State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of '0's found and shifted, and `t` has the elements from index `0` to `n - 1` shifted to the right by the number of '0's found.**
