The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is `n - i + 1`, so after the execution, the new value of `ans` becomes `n - i + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `t[j]` is updated to `t[i + 2]`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, and `i` must be less than `n - 3` for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `t[j]` is updated to `t[i + 2]`, `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `t[i + 2]`, and `i` must be less than `n - 3` for the loop to execute a second time.**
