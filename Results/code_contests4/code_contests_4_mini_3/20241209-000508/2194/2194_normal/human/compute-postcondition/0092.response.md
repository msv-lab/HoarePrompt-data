The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The value of `j` is equal to `i`, which is between 0 and `n - 2`. Therefore, `j + 1` is at least 1 and at most `n - 1`, meaning `t[j + 1]` is a valid index in the list `t`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the assignment of `temp` based on the current state of `t` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i`, `t` is the list of characters after the swaps, `j` is `i`, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.**
