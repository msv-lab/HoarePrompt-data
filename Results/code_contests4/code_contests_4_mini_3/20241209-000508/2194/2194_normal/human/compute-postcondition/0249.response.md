Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is either -1 or the index of the last '5' in `t` (if found), `j` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of '0's found and shifted, and `t` has the elements from index `0` to `n - 1` shifted to the right by the number of '0's found. If a '5' is encountered, the loop exits; otherwise, `i` will be -1 if no '5' is found in `t`.**
