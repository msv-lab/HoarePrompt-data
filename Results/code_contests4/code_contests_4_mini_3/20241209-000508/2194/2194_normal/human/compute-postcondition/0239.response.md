According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0, iterating from `n - 2` down to 0. The initial state specifies that `i` is either the index of the last '0' in `s` or -1. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 0. 

If `i` is -1, the loop will not execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `i` should be adjusted to be at least 0 (meaning there is at least one '0' at or before index `n - 2` in `s`). The other states (`n`, `j`, `ans`, and `t`) do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, but they can provide context for the loop's operation.

State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0 or greater (to ensure loop execution), `j` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of '0's found and shifted, `t` has the elements from index `i` to `n - 1` shifted to the right by the number of '0's found**
