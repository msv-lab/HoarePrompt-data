According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop starts from index `i` and continues while `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at the value of `i`, which is the index of the last occurrence of '5' in `t`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `j` starts at `i`, it will increase by 1 in the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, meaning `n` must be greater than `i` and `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' in `t`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is the value of `t` at index `j + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be equal to `i + 1`**
