The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` do not change due to this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by 1**
