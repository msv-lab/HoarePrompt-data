The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `j` is equal to `i` and `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `j + 1` is within the bounds of the array `t`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 1; `j` is `i`; `temp` is `t[i + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is 1; `j` is `i`; `temp` is `t[i + 1]`; `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`**.
