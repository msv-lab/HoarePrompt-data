The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, where `j` is now incremented by 1, and it must be less than `n - 2`. The previous state indicates that `temp` will hold the value of the element at position `j + 1` in the array `t`. Other variables `n`, `i`, and `ans` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]**
