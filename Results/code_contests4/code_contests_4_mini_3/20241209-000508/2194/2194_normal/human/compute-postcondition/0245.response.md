Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of '0's found and shifted, and `t` has the elements from index `0` to `n - 1` shifted to the right by the number of '0's found. If `t[i]` is '5', no changes are made to `ans`, `i`, `j`, or the array `t`; otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
