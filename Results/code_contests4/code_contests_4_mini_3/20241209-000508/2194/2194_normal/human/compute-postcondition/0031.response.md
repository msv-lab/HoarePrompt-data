The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` remains unchanged; `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` remains unchanged; `cnt` is increased by 1**
