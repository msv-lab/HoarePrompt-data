The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `n - 1 - i`. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, so we can substitute this into the expression:

`ans += n - 1 - (n - 3)`

This simplifies to:

`ans += n - 1 - n + 3`
`ans += 2`

Since `ans` is increased by 2, and the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is increased by 2**
