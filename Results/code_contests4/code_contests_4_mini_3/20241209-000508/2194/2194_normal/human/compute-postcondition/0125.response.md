Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is between 0 and `n - 2`, and `t` has the characters from index `i` to `n - 2` shifted left by one position. If `t[0]` is '0', then `ans` is either 1000000000000000 if `n` equals 3, or equal to the number of leading '0's plus `n - 2` if `n` is greater than 3.***
