To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we can analyze the behavior of the loop and the variables involved.

The loop iterates from index `i` to `n - 1`. In each iteration:
- `ans` is incremented by 1, thus counting the number of iterations executed.
- The character at index `j + 1` is temporarily stored in `temp`, and then the value at index `j` is replaced with the value at index `j + 1`, effectively shifting elements in the list `t` to the left.

After the loop finishes executing:
- If `i` is -1 (meaning '5' was not present), the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0.
- If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop executes `n - 1 - i` times (as long as `j` stays within bounds). Consequently, `ans` will equal this count.
- The list `t` will have its elements starting from index `i` to `n - 1` shifted left by the number of iterations, effectively removing elements starting from `t[i]` onward.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' in `t` (or -1 if '5' is not present); `ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, which is `n - 1 - i` if `i` is not -1; `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 1` have been shifted left.**
