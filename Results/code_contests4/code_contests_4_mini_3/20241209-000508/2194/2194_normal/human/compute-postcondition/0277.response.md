Postcondition: ***If `t[i]` is not '0', then `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1, `t` has elements shifted to the right by the number of '0's found, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, the first element of `t` is '0', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
