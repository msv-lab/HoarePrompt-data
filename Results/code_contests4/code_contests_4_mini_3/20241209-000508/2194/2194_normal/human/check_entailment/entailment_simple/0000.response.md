Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to make the number divisible by 25. Here are the main reasons for this conclusion:

1. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are either "00", "25", "50", or "75". The program only considers the cases for '0's, '5's, '2's, and '7's but does not ensure that it checks all valid combinations of pairs of digits that can form these endings.

2. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The program attempts to manage cases where leading zeros might be created after swaps, but the logic is convoluted and may not cover all scenarios where a valid pair of digits for forming "25", "50", or "75" exists.

3. **Redundant Logic**: The program contains complex logic to count digits and perform calculations that may not be necessary. After finding valid pairs, it should directly calculate the number of swaps needed without excessive conditions.

4. **Output Conditions**: The program checks if `fin` is greater than \(10^{10}\) to print `-1`, which is not aligned with the requirements. The requirement states that `-1` should be printed if it's impossible to form a number divisible by 25, but the condition for determining "impossibility" is not correctly implemented.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not seem to fully account for all edge cases. For instance, it may fail when there are not enough digits or specific combinations that allow forming a valid number ending that is divisible by 25.

Due to these reasons, the program does not meet the requirements set in the problem description and may yield incorrect results for certain inputs.
