You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima and Inna are doing so great! At the moment, Inna is sitting on the magic lawn playing with a pink pony. Dima wanted to play too. He brought an n × m chessboard, a very tasty candy and two numbers a and b.

Dima put the chessboard in front of Inna and placed the candy in position (i, j) on the board. The boy said he would give the candy if it reaches one of the corner cells of the board. He's got one more condition. There can only be actions of the following types:

  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y - b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y - b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y + b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y + b). 



Naturally, Dima doesn't allow to move the candy beyond the chessboard borders.

Inna and the pony started shifting the candy around the board. They wonder what is the minimum number of allowed actions that they need to perform to move the candy from the initial position (i, j) to one of the chessboard corners. Help them cope with the task! 

Input

The first line of the input contains six integers n, m, i, j, a, b (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 106; 1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ j ≤ m; 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. Position (i, j) in the statement is a chessboard cell on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. You can consider that the corners are: (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1).

Output

In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy.

If Inna and the pony cannot get the candy playing by Dima's rules, print on a single line "Poor Inna and pony!" without the quotes.

Examples

Input

5 7 1 3 2 2


Output

2


Input

5 5 2 3 1 1


Output

Poor Inna and pony!

Note

Note to sample 1:

Inna and the pony can move the candy to position (1 + 2, 3 + 2) = (3, 5), from there they can move it to positions (3 - 2, 5 + 2) = (1, 7) and (3 + 2, 5 + 2) = (5, 7). These positions correspond to the corner squares of the chess board. Thus, the answer to the test sample equals two.
Program:
```
(n, m, x, y, a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
v = 1 << 60
for c in [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]:
    dx = abs(x - c[0])
    dy = abs(y - c[1])
    if 0 == dx + dy:
        v = 0
    elif dx % a == 0 and dy % b == 0 and (dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2):
        v = min(v, max(dx / a, dy / b))
if v and (max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b):
    v = 1 << 60
print('Poor Inna and pony!', v)[v < 1 << 55]
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
