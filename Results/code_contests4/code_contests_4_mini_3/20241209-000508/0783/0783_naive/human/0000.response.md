To analyze the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, we need to evaluate whether it accurately implements the logic required to determine the minimum number of moves to get the candy to one of the corners of the chessboard, or if it correctly identifies when it is impossible to do so.

### Program Review:
The program reads in the dimensions of the chessboard and the starting position of the candy, as well as the allowed movement distances. It calculates the distance to each of the four corners of the chessboard and checks if the candy can be moved to those corners using the specified movements. The key conditions to check are:

1. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from the current position to the corner is calculated using the absolute difference in rows (`dx`) and columns (`dy`).
2. **Movement Feasibility**:
   - The distances `dx` and `dy` must be divisible by `a` and `b` respectively, meaning the candy can reach the corner in multiples of the allowed moves.
   - The parity of the number of moves required in both dimensions must be the same, ensuring that both move types can be performed an equal number of times to reach the target corner.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program checks if the candy can be moved within the chessboard limits after the necessary moves. If not, it sets an unreachable condition.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Starting Position at a Corner**: If the candy starts at one of the corners, it should return 0 moves, but the check for `0 == dx + dy` correctly handles this.
2. **Inability to Move**: If `a` or `b` is larger than the chessboard dimensions, or if the starting position is such that no legal moves can be made (e.g., if `n - x < a` or `m - y < b`), the response should correctly identify this as "Poor Inna and pony!".
3. **Large Inputs**: The program should be able to handle the maximum constraints without performance issues.

### Analysis of the Current Implementation:
While the program logic appears to be mostly sound, we need to recheck the conditions under which it sets `v` to an unreachable state. Specifically, the line:

```python
if v and (max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b):
    v = 1 << 60
```

This condition may incorrectly set `v` when it should still be possible to reach one of the corners depending on the distances and the parity checks. 

For instance, if `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `x = 2`, `y = 3`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`, it should be possible to reach (1, 1) with moves but might not be accurately reported due to the boundary checks.

### Conclusion:
Considering the edge cases and the potential flaws in the program logic, particularly regarding boundary conditions and movement feasibility checks, we can conclude that the implementation does not cover all potential scenarios correctly:

Correctness: **False**. 

A specific case that fails is when starting from a position where direct moves are possible but the program mistakenly sets `v` to an unreachable state due to boundary checks without considering reachable corners properly.
