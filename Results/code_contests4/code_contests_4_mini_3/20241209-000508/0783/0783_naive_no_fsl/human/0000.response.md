Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly calculates the number of moves required to reach the corners of the chessboard based on the specified conditions. The logical flaw lies in how it handles the movement logic, particularly in the condition where it checks if the candy can reach the corners.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5 5 2 3 1 1
```
In this case, the candy starts at position (2, 3) and can only move by 1 unit in either direction. The corners are (1, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), and (5, 5). 

From (2, 3), the only possible moves are to:
- (1, 2)
- (3, 2)
- (1, 4)
- (3, 4)

None of these moves can directly reach any of the corners in subsequent moves, as the moves would always alternate between odd and even positions which prevent reaching the corners. 

However, the program outputs "Poor Inna and pony!" which is the correct response according to the problem description, but it does not correctly handle the logic to determine the minimum number of moves to reach the corners for all scenarios as it miscalculates when moves are possible versus when they are not.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the correctness requirements for all potential inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
