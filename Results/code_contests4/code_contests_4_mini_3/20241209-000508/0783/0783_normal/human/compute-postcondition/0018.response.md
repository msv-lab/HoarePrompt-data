Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; if `0 == dx + dy`, then `v` is set to 0. Otherwise, `dy` is the absolute difference between `y` and `c[1]`. If `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and both `dx / a` and `dy / b` have the same parity, then `v` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `dx / a` and `dy / b`.***
