Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`. If `dx % a == 0` and `dy % b == 0` and `(dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2)`, then `dy` is undefined and `v` cannot be calculated due to the undefined state of `dy`.***
