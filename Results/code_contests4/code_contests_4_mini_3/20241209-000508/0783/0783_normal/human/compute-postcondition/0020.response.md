The variable `c` is a tuple set to (1, m). The code calculates `dx` as the absolute difference between `x` and the first element of the tuple `c`, which is `c[0]` (equal to 1). Therefore, `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`**.
