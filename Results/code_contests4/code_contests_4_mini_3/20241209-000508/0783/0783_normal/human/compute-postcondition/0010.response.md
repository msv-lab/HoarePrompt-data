Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `v` is assigned the minimum value between `v` (1152921504606846976) and the maximum value of `dx / a` or `dy / b` if `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the parity of `dx / a` matches the parity of `dy / b`.***
