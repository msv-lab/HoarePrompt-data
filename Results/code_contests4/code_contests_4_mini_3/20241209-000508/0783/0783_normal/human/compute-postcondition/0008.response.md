Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `v` is 1152921504606846976; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - c[0])`; `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`; the sum of `dx` and `dy` is greater than 0; `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the results of `dx / a` and `dy / b` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd).***
