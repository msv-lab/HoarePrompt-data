Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`; `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`, where `c[1]` is undefined. If `dx + dy` is equal to 0, then `v` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `dx + dy` is not equal to 0, and `dx % a == 0`, `dy % b == 0`, and `(dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2)`, then `dy` is undefined and `v` cannot be calculated due to the undefined state of `dy`.***
