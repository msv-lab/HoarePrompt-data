The value of `v` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `c[1]`) remain unchanged and unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`; `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`, where `c[1]` is undefined; `v` is 0.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`; `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`, where `c[1]` is undefined; `v` is 0**.
