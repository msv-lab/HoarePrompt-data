The function `func` accepts six parameters: `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`. All parameters are integers, with the following constraints: 1 ≤ n, m, i ≤ n, j ≤ m, and 1 ≤ a, b. The function does not directly return a value in the provided output, but it is implied that it performs operations based on the input parameters. However, without specific output details, we cannot define the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept six integers `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`, with specific constraints on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, i, j, a, and b, all of which are integers with constraints: 1 ≤ n, m, i ≤ n, j ≤ m, and 1 ≤ a, b.**
