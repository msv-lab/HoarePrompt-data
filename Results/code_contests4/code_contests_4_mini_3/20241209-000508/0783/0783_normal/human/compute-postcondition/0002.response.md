In the provided for loop, the execution depends on the variable `c`, which is derived from a list of tuples. The loop will iterate over the four tuples in the list: `(1, m)`, `(n, 1)`, `(n, m)`, and `(1, 1)`.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that the list of tuples is not empty. In this case, it is clearly defined as containing four tuples, so the loop will execute.

However, we should also consider the implications of the tuple values on the loop body (which is omitted in this case). The variables `n` and `m` must be initialized correctly (they can be set to any integer value) so that they can be utilized in the tuples.

Since `x` and `y` are integers from input and do not directly affect the execution of the loop, they do not need to be modified for the loop to execute. 

Here is the state adjustment based on the information provided:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers (any integer values), `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers (any integer values), `x` and `y` are integers from input, `v` is 1152921504606846976, for the loop to execute the first time `c` will take values from the tuples: (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)**
