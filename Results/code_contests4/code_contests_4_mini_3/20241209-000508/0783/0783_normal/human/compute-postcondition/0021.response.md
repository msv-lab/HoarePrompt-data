The variable `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`. The value of `y` is provided as input, and `c[1]` refers to the second element of the list or array `c`, which is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value for `dy` without knowing the value of `c[1]`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `dx`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`; `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`, where `c[1]` is undefined.**
