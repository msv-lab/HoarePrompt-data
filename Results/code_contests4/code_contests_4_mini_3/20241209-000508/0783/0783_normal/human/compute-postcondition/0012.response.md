According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list of tuples provided in the loop. The loop will iterate over the list `[(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]`, which contains 4 pairs. If the loop has executed once, it must have processed the first pair `(1, m)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop must have processed the first element, so we can infer that `c` is currently `(1, m)`. For the loop to execute again, `c` must take the next tuple in the list. Since `c` was the first tuple, the next value of `c` will be `(n, 1)`.

Therefore, the loop will execute a second time with `c` set to `(n, 1)`. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; if `dx + dy` equals 0, then `v` is set to 0, and `x` equals `1`, while `y` equals `1`; for the loop to execute a second time, `c` is (n, 1)**
