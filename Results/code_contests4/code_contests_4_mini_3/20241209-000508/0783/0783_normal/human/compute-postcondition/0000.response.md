The code assigns the values from input to the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that the conditions are satisfied as per the initial state. The values of `x` and `y` will be taken from the input. Other variables remain unchanged unless specified by the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input.**
