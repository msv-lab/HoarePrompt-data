Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `v` is 1152921504606846976; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - c[0])`; `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`; the sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0, meaning `x` is equal to `c[0]` and `y` is equal to `c[1]`.***
