Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; if `dx + dy` equals 0, then `v` is set to 0, and `x` equals `c[0]` while `y` equals `c[1]`. Otherwise, `v` is assigned the minimum value between 1152921504606846976 and the maximum value of `dx / a` or `dy / b`, provided that `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the parity of `dx / a` matches the parity of `dy / b`.***
