The value of `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`, and the value of `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`, where `c[1]` is undefined. Since `c[1]` is undefined, `dy` cannot be calculated. The variable `v` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `dx / a` and `dy / b`. However, due to `dy` being undefined, the calculation for `v` cannot be completed. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the undefined nature of `dy` and the inability to compute `v`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - 1)`; `dy` is undefined; `v` cannot be calculated due to undefined `dy`.**
