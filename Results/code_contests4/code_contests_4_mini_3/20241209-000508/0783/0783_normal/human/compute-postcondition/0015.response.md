The value of `v` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Since no specific values are given for these variables or for `c[1]`, we cannot provide further details about their states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `dy` is assigned the value of `abs(y - c[1])`, where `c[1]` is unknown; `v` is 0.
