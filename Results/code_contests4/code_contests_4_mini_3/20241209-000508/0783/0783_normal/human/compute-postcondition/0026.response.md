Output State: **`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `v` is the minimum of its initial value (1152921504606846976) and the maximum values computed from the valid conditions based on the absolute differences between `x`, `y`, and the coordinates in `c`, if any valid conditions were satisfied. If any coordinate matches `x` and `y`, then `v` is set to 0.**
