Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; if `v` is non-zero and the maximum of `n - x` or `x - 1` is less than `a`, or the maximum of `m - y` or `y - 1` is less than `b`, then `v` is set to 1 << 60. Otherwise, `v` retains its value, which is the minimum of its initial value (1152921504606846976) and the maximum values computed from the valid conditions based on the absolute differences between `x`, `y`, and the coordinates in `c`, with the possibility of being set to 0 if any coordinate matches `x` and `y`.***
