The variable `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`. The value of `y` is provided as input, and `c[1]` can either be 1 or `n`. Therefore, the value of `dy` will depend on the specific value of `y` and the specific value of `c[1]`. 

Since the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are maintained and only `dy` is affected, the output state reflects the assignment of `dy`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` and `y` are integers from input; `v` is 1152921504606846976; `dx` is assigned the value `abs(x - c[0])`; `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`**.
