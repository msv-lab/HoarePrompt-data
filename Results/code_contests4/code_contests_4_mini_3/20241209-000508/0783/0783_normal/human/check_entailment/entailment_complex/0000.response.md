To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the corresponding logic in the code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program should determine the minimum number of moves needed to move a candy from an initial position (i, j) on an n Ã— m chessboard to one of the four corners:
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, m)
   - (n, 1)
   - (n, m)
   
2. The candy can move using specific rules:
   - It can move from (x, y) to (x - a, y - b)
   - It can move from (x, y) to (x + a, y - b)
   - It can move from (x, y) to (x - a, y + b)
   - It can move from (x, y) to (x + a, y + b)

3. The program should return the minimum number of moves or indicate that it's impossible to reach a corner with the message "Poor Inna and pony!".

### Code Analysis:
1. The function initializes a variable `v` to a very large value to track the minimum number of moves.
2. It iterates over the four corners and calculates the absolute differences `dx` and `dy` between the current position (x, y) and each corner.
3. The program checks:
   - If the candy is already at a corner (`dx + dy == 0`), it sets `v` to 0.
   - If both `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and if the ratio of `dx / a` and `dy / b` have the same parity, it updates `v` with the maximum of these ratios.
4. After the loop, it checks if the maximum distances to the edges of the grid are less than `a` or `b`, and if so, resets `v` to a very large value.
5. Finally, it prints "Poor Inna and pony!" followed by the value of `v` if `v` is less than a certain threshold.

### Issues Identified:
- The condition that checks if `dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2` ensures that the number of moves in x and y directions must have the same parity. This condition is necessary for the candy to reach a corner because each move changes both x and y positions simultaneously.
- The check `if (v and (max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b))` may incorrectly reset `v` to a large value in some situations where it is still possible to reach a corner with a valid number of moves. This may lead to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic as required by the problem description due to its handling of the movement conditions and the final check of `v`. There are scenarios where the candy can still reach a corner despite certain conditions being met, and yet the program would output "Poor Inna and pony!" incorrectly.

Thus, the program does not always fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
