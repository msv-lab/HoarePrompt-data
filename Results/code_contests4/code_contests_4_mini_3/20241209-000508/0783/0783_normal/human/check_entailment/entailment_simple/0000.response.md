To evaluate the correctness of the given annotated Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze whether the program adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of moves needed to transfer a candy from a starting position `(i, j)` on an `n Ã— m` chessboard to one of the four corners: `(1, 1)`, `(1, m)`, `(n, 1)`, or `(n, m)`. The movement rules allow shifting the candy by `a` rows and `b` columns in various combinations.

### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Corner Movement Logic**: The program iterates through the four corners of the chessboard and calculates the necessary horizontal (`dx`) and vertical (`dy`) distances to each corner from the starting position `(x, y)` (where `x` and `y` correspond to `i` and `j`).

3. **Movement Validation**: The program checks if the distances `dx` and `dy` are both divisible by `a` and `b`, respectively, and that the number of required moves in each direction has the same parity (i.e., both must be even or both must be odd). This ensures that it is possible to reach the corner cell, given the movement constraints.

4. **Move Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of moves required to reach the corner based on the distances and updates the minimum moves (`v`) accordingly.

5. **Final Condition**: A check is performed to see if reaching a corner is impossible due to the given distances and board constraints, and if so, it sets `v` to a large value.

6. **Output**: The program finally prints either the number of moves or a message indicating that it's impossible to reach a corner.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- The program properly checks the conditions necessary to determine if moving to a corner is feasible based on the provided movement rules.
- It correctly identifies the parity of required moves and ensures that the candy can be moved within the bounds of the chessboard.
- The output corresponds to the problem requirements, providing the correct response in cases when reaching a corner is impossible.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to all rules and requirements described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the minimum moves needed or indicates when it is impossible to reach a corner.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
