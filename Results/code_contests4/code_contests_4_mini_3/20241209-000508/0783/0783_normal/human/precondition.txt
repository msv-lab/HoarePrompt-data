n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the chessboard (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6), i and j are positive integers representing the initial position of the candy on the chessboard (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m), and a and b are positive integers representing the step sizes for moving the candy (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6).
