The function accepts six integer parameters: n, m, x, y, a, and b, where 1 ≤ n, m, x ≤ n, y ≤ m, and 1 ≤ a, b. It calculates a value v based on the distance from (x, y) to four corners of a grid defined by (1, 1), (1, m), (n, 1), and (n, m). If the distance can be evenly divided by a and b, and the resulting ratios have the same parity, it updates v to the maximum of the two ratios. If (x, y) matches any corner, v is set to 0. If certain conditions on the maximum distances to the edges of the grid are met, v is reset to its initial large value. The function finally prints 'Poor Inna and pony!' followed by v if v is less than 1 << 55; otherwise, it prints nothing.
