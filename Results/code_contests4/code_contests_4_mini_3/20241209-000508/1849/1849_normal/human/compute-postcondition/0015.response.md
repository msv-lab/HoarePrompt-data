Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', and `sh` is the count of '#' in `s`. The value of `right` is greater than the value of `left`. The list `ans` remains unchanged, and `j` is 0. If `i` is equal to '(', then `left` is decremented by 1, while `right`, `sh`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `i` is equal to ')', then `right` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `right` is updated to be `right - ans[p]`. If `i` is not equal to '(' or ')', then `p` is increased by 1. `s` is a non-empty iterable.***
