Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '('. If `i` is '(', then `left` is decremented by 1, while `right` remains unchanged, `sh` is the count of '#' in `s`, `j` is 1, and `i` is the second character in the string `s`. If `i` is ')', then `right` is decreased by 1; if `i` is not ')', `right` is decreased by `ans[p]`. The count `sh` remains the same, the loop has enough characters remaining, `j` is 1, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, and `p` is increased by 1.***
