The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. As a result, there are no changes to the values of any variables, and the program exits without returning any value. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#' in `s`, `ans` remains unchanged, `j` is 0, and the program exits without further execution.
