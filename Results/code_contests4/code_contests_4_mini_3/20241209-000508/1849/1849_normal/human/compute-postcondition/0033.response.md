The variable `p` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`left`, `right`, `sh`, `j`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the count of '(', `right` is decreased by ans[p], `sh` is the count of '#' in `s`, the loop has enough characters remaining, `j` is 1, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, and `p` is increased by 1.
