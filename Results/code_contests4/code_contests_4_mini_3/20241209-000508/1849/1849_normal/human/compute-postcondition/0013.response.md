Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', `right` is decremented by 1 if `i` is equal to ')', otherwise `right` is updated to be `right - ans[p]`. `sh` is the count of '#' in `s`, and `ans` is a list of size `sh`, where the first `sh - 1` elements are `1` and the last element is `abs(right - sh - 1)`. `s` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is 0, and if `i` is not equal to '(' or ')', then `p` is increased by 1.***
