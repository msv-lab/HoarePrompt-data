Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', and `sh` is the count of '#' in `s`. If `i` is '(', then `left` is decreased by 1, while `right`, `sh`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `i` is a closing parenthesis `')'`, then `right` is decremented by 1, and `ans`, `j`, `left`, and `sh` remain unchanged, with the condition that `right` must not be greater than `left`, and `s` must have at least 2 characters. Otherwise, `right` is decremented by `ans[p]`, `p` is incremented by 1, and `ans`, `j`, `left`, and `sh` remain unchanged.***
