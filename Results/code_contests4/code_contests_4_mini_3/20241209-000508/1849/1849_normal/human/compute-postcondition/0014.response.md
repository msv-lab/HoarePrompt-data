Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', and `sh` is the count of '#' in `s`. If `i` is equal to '(', then `left` is decremented by 1, while `right`, `sh`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `i` is equal to ')', then `right` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `right` is updated to be `right - ans[p]`. The list `ans` remains the same, and if `i` is not equal to '(' or ')', then `p` is increased by 1. In all cases, `s` is a non-empty iterable, and `j` is 0.***
