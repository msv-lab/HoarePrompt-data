The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `left` is the count of '(', it is reduced by 1, while the other variables `right`, `sh`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is decreased by 1, `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` remains unchanged, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`left` is decreased by 1, `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` remains unchanged, and `j` is 1**.
