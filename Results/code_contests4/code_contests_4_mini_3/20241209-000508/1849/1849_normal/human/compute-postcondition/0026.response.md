The code snippet contains a print statement that outputs `-1`. It does not modify the values of any variables, including `left`, `right`, `sh`, `ans`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state only reflects the printed value without any changes to the initial variables.

Output State: **`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#' in `s`, and -1 has been printed**.
