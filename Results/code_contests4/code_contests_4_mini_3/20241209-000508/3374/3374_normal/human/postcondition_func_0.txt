The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case it reads two integers `n` and `x`, then reads a list of `n` integers. It calculates the maximal power of `x` that divides each integer in the list, finds the minimum power, and identifies its index. Based on these values, it calls another function `func_2` with a computed value derived from the sum of the list and the minimum power. The function does not return any value.
