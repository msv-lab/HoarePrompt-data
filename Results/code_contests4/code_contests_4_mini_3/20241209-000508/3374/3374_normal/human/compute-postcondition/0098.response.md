The variable `pow_x` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n`. The value of `n` comes from input, which means `pow_x` will contain `n` zeros. The other variables `t`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers from input; `pow_x` is a list of zeros of length `n`.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers from input; `pow_x` is a list of zeros of length `n`.**
