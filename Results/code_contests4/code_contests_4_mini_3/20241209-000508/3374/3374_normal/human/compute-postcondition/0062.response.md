The variable `ai` is updated by performing integer division with `x`, meaning `ai` is now equal to `ai // x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The specific value of `ai` will depend on its previous value and the value of `x`, which is not provided, but since `ai` is a multiple of `x`, the result of `ai // x` will yield a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to `ai`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 3, `ai` is updated to `ai // x`.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 3, `ai` is updated to `ai // x**.
