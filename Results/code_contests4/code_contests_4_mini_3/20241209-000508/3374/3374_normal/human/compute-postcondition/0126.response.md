The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. This directly affects the value of `cnt`, setting it to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`, `pow_x[0]` is 0; `pow_x[1]` is `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`, `pow_x[0]` is 0; `pow_x[1]` is 0**
