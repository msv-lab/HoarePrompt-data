The value of `cnt` is assigned 0, which resets its previous value. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is the third element in the list, `cnt` is 0, `pow_x[0]` is assigned the value of `cnt`, `pow_x[1]` is assigned the value of `cnt`.
