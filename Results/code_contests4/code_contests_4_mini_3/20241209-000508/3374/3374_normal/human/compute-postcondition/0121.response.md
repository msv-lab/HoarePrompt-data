The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[0]`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 3, `ai` is the value of the second element of `a`, `pow_x[0]` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `ai` must be divisible by `x`.
