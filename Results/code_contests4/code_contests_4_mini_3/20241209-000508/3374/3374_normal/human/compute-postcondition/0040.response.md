The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is not specified. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `ai`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is at least x before division, `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is at least x before division, `cnt` is increased by 1**
