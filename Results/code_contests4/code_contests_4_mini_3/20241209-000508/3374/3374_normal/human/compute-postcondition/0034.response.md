The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` is being increased, its previous value was not provided, thus we cannot determine the exact new value of `cnt`. However, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is the third element of `a`, and `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is the third element of `a`, and `cnt` is increased by 1.**
