`cnt` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, `cnt` is 0.
