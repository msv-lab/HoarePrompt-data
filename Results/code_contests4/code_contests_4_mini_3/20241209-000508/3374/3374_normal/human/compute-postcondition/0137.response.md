The variable `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The variable `i` is 2, so `pow_x[2]` will be assigned the value of `cnt`. The previous values of `pow_x[0]` and `pow_x[1]` are 0, but they are not affected by this assignment. The output state is defined by the new value of `pow_x[2]`, which is now equal to `cnt`. 

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, `ai` is the result of the final integer division of the original value of `ai` by `x` raised to the power of `cnt`, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is 0, `pow_x[2]` is `cnt`.**
