The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is reset to 0 regardless of its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the value of the second element of `a`, `pow_x[0]` is `cnt`.
