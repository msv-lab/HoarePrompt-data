The value of `ai` is updated by performing integer division by `x`. The previous value of `ai` is the second element of list `a`. However, since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `ai` after the operation. Therefore, we state that `ai` is now the result of `ai // x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 3, `ai` is now the result of `ai // x`, `pow_x[0]` is 0.**
