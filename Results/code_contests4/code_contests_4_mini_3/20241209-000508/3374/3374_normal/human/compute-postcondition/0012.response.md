The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The value of `x` is already defined as the second element in `args`. The other variables `t`, `args`, and `sep` remain unchanged as the operation does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sep` is written to the file, `x` is the second element in `args` as a string, and `x` has been written to the file.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sep` is written to the file, `x` is the second element in `args` as a string, and `x` has been written to the file.**
