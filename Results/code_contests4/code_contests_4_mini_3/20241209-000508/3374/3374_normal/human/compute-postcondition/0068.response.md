The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `pow_x[0]` remains assigned the value of `cnt`, `cnt` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `pow_x[0]` remains assigned the value of `cnt`, `cnt` is 1**
