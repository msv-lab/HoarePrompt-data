The value of `cnt` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is the third element of `a`, and `cnt` is 0. 

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is the third element of `a`, and `cnt` is 0**.
