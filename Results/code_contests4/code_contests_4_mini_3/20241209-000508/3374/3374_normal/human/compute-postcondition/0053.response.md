The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ai`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0**
