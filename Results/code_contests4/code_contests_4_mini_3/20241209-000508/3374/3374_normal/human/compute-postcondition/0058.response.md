The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 1, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ai`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element of the list `a` divided by `x`, `cnt` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a[0]` must be a multiple of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element of the list `a` divided by `x`, `cnt` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a[0]` must be a multiple of `x.**
