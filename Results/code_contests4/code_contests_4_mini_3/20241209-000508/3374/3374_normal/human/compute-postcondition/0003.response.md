According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` variable. For the loop to execute, `args` needs to contain at least one element. The current state indicates that `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100, but it does not provide any information about `args`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` is a list or collection with at least one element to allow the loop to execute.

Additionally, since `at_start` is True, we can assume that we are at the beginning of our process, but it does not directly affect the loop execution.

For the loop to execute the first time, `args` must contain at least one element. Thus, I will include that in the state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a list with at least 1 element**
