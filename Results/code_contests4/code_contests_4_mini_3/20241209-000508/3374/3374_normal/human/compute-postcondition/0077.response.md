The variable `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is known from the initial state as the total count of divisions by `x`. Since `i` is initially 1, `pow_x[1]` will now hold the value of `cnt`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the value of the original `ai` divided by `x` raised to the power of `cnt`, `cnt` is the total count of divisions by `x`, `pow_x[0]` is assigned the value of `cnt`, and `pow_x[1]` is assigned the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the value of the original `ai` divided by `x` raised to the power of `cnt`, `cnt` is the total count of divisions by `x`, `pow_x[0]` is assigned the value of `cnt`, `pow_x[1]` is assigned the value of `cnt`.**
