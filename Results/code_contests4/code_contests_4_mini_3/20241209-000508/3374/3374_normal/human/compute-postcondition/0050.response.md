The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers created from the input, which is split into components and converted to integers. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this operation, and since the specific values of the input are not provided, we can only describe what `a` will contain. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from input.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from input**.
