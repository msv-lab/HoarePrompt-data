After all iterations of the loop have executed, the following observations can be made:

- `cnt` will be equal to the total number of times `ai` (the second element of `a`) can be divided by `x` without leaving a remainder.
- `ai` will be the result of the last division of `ai` by `x`, which means it will no longer be divisible by `x`.
- `t` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `a` remains a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` remains 1.

Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the result of the second element of `a` after all possible divisions by `x`, and `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`.**
