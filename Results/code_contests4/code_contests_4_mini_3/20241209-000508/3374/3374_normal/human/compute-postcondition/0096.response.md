The code assigns the values from `input().split()` to `n` and `x`, converting them to integers using `map`. The initial state indicates that `t` is within the range of 1 to 100, which suggests that the loop may execute based on the value of `t`. However, the values of `n` and `x` are taken from user input and are not specified, so we cannot determine their specific values. As a result, the output state will reflect that `n` and `x` are assigned from input.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100; `n` and `x` are assigned values from input.**
