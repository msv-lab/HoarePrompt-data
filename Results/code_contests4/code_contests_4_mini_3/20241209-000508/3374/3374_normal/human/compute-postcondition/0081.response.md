The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1**
