Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `pow_x` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` can be divided by `x`, and each element in `a` is the result of the final integer division of the original value by `x` raised to the power of the count stored in `pow_x`.**
