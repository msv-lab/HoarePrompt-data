Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The total length of all arrays across all test cases does not exceed 10^5; the code prints values to a stream or to sys.stdout by default.**
