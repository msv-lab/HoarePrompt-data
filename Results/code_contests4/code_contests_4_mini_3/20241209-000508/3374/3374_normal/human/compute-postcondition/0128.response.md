The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be a divisor of `ai`.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be a divisor of `ai`.**
