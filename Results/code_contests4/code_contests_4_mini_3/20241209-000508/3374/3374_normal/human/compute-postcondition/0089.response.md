Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is the number of times `a[2]` can be divided by `x` before it no longer satisfies `ai % x == 0`, and `a[2]` is updated to the value of `a[2] // x^cnt` where `x` is a positive integer.**
