The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `pow_x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is 0.
