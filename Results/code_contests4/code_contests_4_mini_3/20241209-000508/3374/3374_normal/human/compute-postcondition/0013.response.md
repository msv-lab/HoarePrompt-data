The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, but this does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sep` is written to the file, `x` is the second element in `args` as a string, and `x` has been written to the file; `at_start` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `sep` is written to the file; `x` is the second element in `args` as a string; `x` has been written to the file; `at_start` is set to `False`.**
