Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `pow_x` is a list of integers where each element represents the maximum number of times the corresponding element in `a` can be divided by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`; `func_2` is called with a computed value based on these variables for each iteration of the loop.**
