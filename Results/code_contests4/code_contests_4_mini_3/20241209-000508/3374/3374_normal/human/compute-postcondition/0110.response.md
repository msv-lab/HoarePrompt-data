Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `cnt` is the count of how many times the first element of `a` (denoted as `ai`) can be divided by `x`, and `ai` is the value of the first element of `a` after all possible divisions by `x` (exact value cannot be determined but it will be a value that is not divisible by `x`).**
