The code snippet reads two values, `n` and `x`, from input and assigns them after converting from string to integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `x` will depend on the input provided, and since the initial state has `t` within the range 1 to 100, it does not affect this calculation. Other variables are not directly impacted by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
