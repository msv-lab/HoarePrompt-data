The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. The other variables `t`, `a`, `i`, and `ai` remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute again depends on the value of `ai`, which is still at least `x * x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the second element of `a` divided by `x`, and `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the second element of `a` divided by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
