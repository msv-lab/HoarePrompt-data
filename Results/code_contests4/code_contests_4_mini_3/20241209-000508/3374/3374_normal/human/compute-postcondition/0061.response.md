The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `cnt` is 2, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is a multiple of `x`, `cnt` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is a multiple of `x`, `cnt` is 3**
