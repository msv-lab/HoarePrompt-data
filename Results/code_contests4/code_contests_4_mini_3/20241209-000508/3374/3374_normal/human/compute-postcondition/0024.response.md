The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple test cases based on predefined constraints. The output for each test case is likely determined by evaluating the values of `n`, `x`, and the list `a` of integers, which are defined within the function's context based on the specified constraints. Since the exact output logic is not provided, we will summarize the expected behavior based on the input characteristics.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of integers `a`. It returns results based on the evaluation of these inputs according to the defined constraints.**
