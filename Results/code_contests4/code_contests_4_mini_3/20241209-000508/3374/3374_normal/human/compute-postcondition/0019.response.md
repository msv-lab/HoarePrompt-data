The loop iterates over each element in the `args` list. If there is at least one element in `args`, it writes the first element directly, and for subsequent elements, it first writes the `sep` followed by the element. The variable `at_start` is used to manage whether to prepend `sep` before each element except the first.

If `args` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the values of the variables remain unchanged from the initial state.

After all iterations of the loop:
- If `args` has `n` elements, `sep` has been written `n-1` times (once before each element after the first), and all `n` elements of `args` have been written to the file as strings.
- `at_start` will be `False` after the first iteration and remains `False`.

Thus, the final output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `args` is a list of integers; `sep` has been written to the file `n-1` times if `args` has at least 1 element; all elements of `args` have been written to the file as strings; `at_start` is False.**
