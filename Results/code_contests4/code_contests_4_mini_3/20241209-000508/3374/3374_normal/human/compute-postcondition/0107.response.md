According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the condition `ai % x == 0` holds true. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been assigned the value of `ai // x`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must still be divisible by `x`.

If `ai` is currently `ai // x`, we need to ensure that the new value of `ai` (which is `ai // x`) is still divisible by `x`. This can be ensured by adjusting the value of `ai` such that `ai` is at least `x` or more before the next iteration.

Thus, if we denote the previous value of `ai` before the last assignment, we can derive that for the next iteration, `ai` should be at least `x * x` to ensure that it remains divisible by `x`.

State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be at least `x * x`**
