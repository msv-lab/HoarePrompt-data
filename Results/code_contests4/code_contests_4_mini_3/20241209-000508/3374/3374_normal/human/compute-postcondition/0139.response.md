`min_pow` is assigned the minimum value from the list `pow_x`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `pow_x` is a list of integers, and `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`.
