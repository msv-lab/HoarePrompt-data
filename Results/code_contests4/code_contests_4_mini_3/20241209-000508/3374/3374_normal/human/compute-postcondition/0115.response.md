The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `ai` is the value of the second element of `a`, `pow_x[0]` is 0, and `x` must be a divisor of `ai`.
