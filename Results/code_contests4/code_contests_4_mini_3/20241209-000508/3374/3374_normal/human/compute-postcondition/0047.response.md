Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `pow_x` is a list of integers where each element represents the maximum number of times the corresponding element in `a` can be divided by `x`, `i` is `n-1`, `ai` is the last element of `a` after all possible divisions by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum of `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`; the value returned from `func_2` is `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`.**
