The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `pow_x[0]` remains assigned the value of `cnt`, and `cnt` is 0.
