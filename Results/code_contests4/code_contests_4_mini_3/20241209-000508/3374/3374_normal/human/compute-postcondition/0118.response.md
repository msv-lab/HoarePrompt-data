The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 1, so after execution, `cnt` will be 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ai`, `pow_x[0]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2, `ai` is the value of the second element of `a`, `pow_x[0]` is 0.
