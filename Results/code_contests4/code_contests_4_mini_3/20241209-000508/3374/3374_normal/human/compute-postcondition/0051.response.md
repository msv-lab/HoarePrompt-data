The code `pow_x = [0] * n` initializes a list named `pow_x` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` is an input integer. Therefore, the length of the list `pow_x` will be equal to the value of `n`, and all its elements will be 0. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from input, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros.**
