Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of times `a[n-1]` can be divided by `x` before it no longer satisfies `a[n-1] % x == 0`, `pow_x` is a list of integers where each element `pow_x[i]` contains the count of divisions of the corresponding element in `a` by `x`.**
