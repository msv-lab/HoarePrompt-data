The value of `ai` is updated to the result of `ai` integer-divided by `x`. Since `ai` is the first element of the list `a` divided by `x`, the new value of `ai` will depend on the current value of `ai` before the operation. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the result of the integer division of its previous value by `x`, and `cnt` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the result of the integer division of its previous value by `x`, `cnt` is 2.**
