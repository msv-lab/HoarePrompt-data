The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it processes multiple test cases based on predefined constraints. Each test case involves an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of integers `a`, and the function returns results based on the calculations performed using these values.

The functionality of the function `func_1` is to handle multiple test cases, performing computations based on an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of integers `a`, and returning results according to the specified logic for those test cases. However, the exact output or results for each test case are not specified in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and processes multiple test cases based on predefined constraints, returning results according to the specified logic for those test cases.**
