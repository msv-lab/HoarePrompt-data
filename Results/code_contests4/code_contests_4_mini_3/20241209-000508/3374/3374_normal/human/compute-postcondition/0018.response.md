The value of `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. Since it was already set to `False`, there is no change in its value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `sep` is written to the file, `x` is the third element in `args` as a string, `at_start` is `False`, and `x` is written to the file.
