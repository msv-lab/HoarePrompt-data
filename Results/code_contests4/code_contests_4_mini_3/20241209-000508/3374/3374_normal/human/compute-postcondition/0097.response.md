The variable `a` is assigned a list comprehension that converts each input value (provided as a space-separated string) into an integer. The values for `n` and `x` are taken from the input but do not affect the assignment of `a`. The exact content of `a` depends on the input provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is assigned a list of integers. 

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 100; `n` and `x` are assigned values from input; `a` is a list of integers from input.**
