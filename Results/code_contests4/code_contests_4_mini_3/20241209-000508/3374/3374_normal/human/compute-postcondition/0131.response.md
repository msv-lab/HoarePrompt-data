The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 1 to 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 100, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be at least `x * 2`.
