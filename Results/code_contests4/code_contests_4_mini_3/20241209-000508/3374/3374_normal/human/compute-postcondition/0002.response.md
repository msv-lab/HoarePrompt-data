Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a provided value or ' '; `file` is either a provided value or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True.**
