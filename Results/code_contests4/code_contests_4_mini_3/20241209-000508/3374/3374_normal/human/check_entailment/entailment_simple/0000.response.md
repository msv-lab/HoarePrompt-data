The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:
   - The robot iterates over the array and processes each element.
   - If the element `q` is divisible by `x`, it adds `x` copies of `q/x` to the end of the array and continues processing.
   - If any element is not divisible by `x`, the robot shuts down, and processing stops.
   - We need to compute the sum of all elements in the array after all possible processing is complete.

2. **Reviewing the Program**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes a list `pow_x`, where for each element in the array, it calculates how many times it can be divided by `x`. This is not directly related to the functionality described in the problem. Instead, it only tracks the maximum number of divisions for each element but does not replicate the behavior of adding new elements to the array.
   - The program calculates a `min_pow` and its index but does not utilize this information to simulate the robot's operations correctly.
   - The resultant sum calculation `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])` does not reflect the actual operations of the robot, as it does not account for the addition of new elements when an element is divisible by `x`.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The program does not dynamically build the array as described; it only computes a static sum based on divisibility counts.
   - The logic for shutting down the robot upon encountering a non-divisible element is not implemented, meaning the program will not stop processing as required.

4. **Conclusion**:
The program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem statement because it fails to simulate the robot's behavior correctly. It does not correctly handle the addition of new elements to the array and does not stop processing when it encounters an element that is not divisible by `x`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
