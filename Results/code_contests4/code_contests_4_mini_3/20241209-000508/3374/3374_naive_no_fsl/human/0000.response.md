Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle the scenario where the robot should continue processing newly added elements after the initial array has been processed. The logic currently only calculates how many times each element can be divided by `x` and tries to compute a total based on that, but it does not simulate the actual process of adding new elements derived from the original array elements.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1 2
12
```

According to the problem description:
1. The robot starts with [12] and `x = 2`.
2. 12 is divisible by 2, so it adds two copies of 12/2 = 6, resulting in [12, 6, 6].
3. Next, it processes the first 6, adds two copies of 6/2 = 3, resulting in [12, 6, 6, 3, 3].
4. It processes the second 6, adds two copies of 3, resulting in [12, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3].
5. Finally, it processes the first 3, which is not divisible by 2, causing the robot to shut down.

The final sum of the elements in the array would be 12 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 36.

However, the current implementation does not simulate this iterative process correctly. It merely calculates how many times each element can be divided by `x` and does not account for newly added elements or the iterative nature of the robot's operations.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
