The function accepts a tuple `a` containing three integers and a tuple `b` containing two lists of integers. It calculates the absolute product of the elements in tuple `a` and `b`, then divides this product by the result of another function, `func_9`, applied to the same tuples. The final result is an integer, and the function assumes that `func_9` returns a non-zero value to avoid division by zero errors. If `func_9` returns zero, this will lead to a runtime error.
