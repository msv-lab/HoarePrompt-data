The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and an optional positive integer `start` (defaulting to 1) and returns a list of all positive divisors of `n`. It iterates from `start` to the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility and including both the divisor and its complement if they are different. If `n` is 0, the behavior is not explicitly handled, and it may lead to unexpected results since 0 has infinitely many divisors. Additionally, if `start` is greater than `n`, the function will return an empty list.
