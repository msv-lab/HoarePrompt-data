N and M are integers representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B respectively, with 1 <= N, M <= 200000; K is a non-negative integer representing the total time allowed, with 1 <= K <= 10^9; A is a list of N integers where each A_i (1 <= i <= N) represents the time in minutes to read the i-th book from Desk A, with 1 <= A_i <= 10^9; B is a list of M integers where each B_i (1 <= i <= M) represents the time in minutes to read the i-th book from Desk B, with 1 <= B_i <= 10^9.
