The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a list of prime numbers `primes`. It calculates the number of divisors of `n` by counting the multiplicities of its prime factors as given in the `primes` list. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 immediately. For each prime in the list, it increases a counter `t` for every time it divides `n` by that prime, and then multiplies `divs_number` by `t`. If `n` is not divisible by any primes in the list, the function will ultimately return a count based on the factors found; if `n` is 0, it will return 0 since the loop won't execute.
