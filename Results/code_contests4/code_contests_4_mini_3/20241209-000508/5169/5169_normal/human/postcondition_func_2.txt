The function accepts non-negative integers `n` and `r`, along with two lists `fact` and `ifact`. It attempts to calculate a value based on the factorial and inverse factorial at indices `n` and `r`. However, if `n` or `r` is greater than the respective lengths of `fact` and `ifact`, or if `n - r` is negative, the function will result in an index out of range error and will not return a value. Therefore, the function's execution is contingent on avoiding such index errors.
