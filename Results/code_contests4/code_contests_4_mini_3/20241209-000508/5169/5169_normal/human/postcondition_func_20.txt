The function accepts a tuple `s` that contains two integers `N` and `M` representing the number of books on desks A and B, an integer `K` representing the maximum time allowed to read books, and two lists `A` and `B` containing the reading times for each book on their respective desks. The function returns the same tuple `s` as its output. However, it does not perform any processing or checks related to the reading times or the maximum time `K`.
