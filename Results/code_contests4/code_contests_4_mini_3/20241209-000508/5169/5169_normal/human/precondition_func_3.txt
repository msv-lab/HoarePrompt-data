Sum is a tuple containing three elements: two integers N and M representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B respectively (1 <= N, M <= 200000), and a non-negative integer K representing the maximum allowable reading time (1 <= K <= 10^9). Following this, there are two lists of integers A and B of lengths N and M respectively, where each element A_i and B_i represents the time in minutes to read the i-th book from Desk A and Desk B (1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9).
