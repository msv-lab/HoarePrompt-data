The function accepts a tuple `d`, an integer `x`, and a value `default`. It searches for `x` in the tuple `d` and returns its first and last occurrence indices. If `x` is not found, it returns `default` for both indices. The function does not account for cases where `d` might be empty or when `x` appears multiple times in a way that could lead to invalid index behavior.
