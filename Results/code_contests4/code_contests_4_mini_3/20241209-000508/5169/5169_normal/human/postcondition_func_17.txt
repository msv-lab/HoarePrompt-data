The function accepts a string `a` containing space-separated integers, a string `sep` for separating the integers in the output, and a string `end` for the ending character of the print statement. It prints the elements of `a` joined by `sep` and ends with `end`. The function does not perform any calculations or determine reading capabilities; it simply formats and prints the input string.
