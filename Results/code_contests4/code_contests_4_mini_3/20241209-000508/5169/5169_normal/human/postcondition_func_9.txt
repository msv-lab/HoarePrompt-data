The function accepts a tuple `a`, which includes reading times and book counts. It checks if the elements in the tuple (excluding the last two elements) are in non-decreasing order. It returns `False` if any pair of consecutive elements is found to be out of order; otherwise, it returns `True`. The function does not utilize the book counts or the maximum reading time and only evaluates the reading times based on the conditions specified.
