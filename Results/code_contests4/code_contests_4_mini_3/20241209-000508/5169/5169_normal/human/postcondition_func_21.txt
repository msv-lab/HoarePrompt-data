The function processes two lists of positive integers, A and B, and counts how many elements can be selected from both lists without the total time exceeding a given limit K. It first selects elements from both lists in a way that prioritizes the smaller element, and if it cannot add any more elements without exceeding K, it reports the count of successfully added elements. If not all elements can be added without exceeding K, it still counts and returns how many were successfully added from both lists. The function does not accept any parameters and prints the count of selectable elements directly. The function does not handle cases where either list is empty or K is less than the smallest element in both lists.
