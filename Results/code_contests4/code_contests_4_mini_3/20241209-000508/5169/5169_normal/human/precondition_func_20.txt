s is a tuple containing three elements: two integers N and M (1 <= N, M <= 200000) representing the number of books on desks A and B respectively, and an integer K (1 <= K <= 10^9) representing the maximum time in minutes allowed to read books; followed by two lists of integers A and B, where A contains N integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^9) representing the reading times for each book on desk A, and B contains M integers (1 <= B[i] <= 10^9) representing the reading times for each book on desk B.
