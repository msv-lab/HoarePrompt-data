n is a tuple containing three integers (N, M, K) where N and M are the number of books on desks A and B respectively (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 200000), and K is the maximum time allowed in minutes (1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9); p is a tuple containing two lists of integers where the first list contains N integers A_i representing the reading times for books on desk A (1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9) and the second list contains M integers B_i representing the reading times for books on desk B (1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^9).
