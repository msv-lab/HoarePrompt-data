The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers (N, M, K) and a tuple `p` containing two lists of integers representing reading times for books on desks A and B. It returns the result of computing the modular inverse of N modulo p using Fermat's Little Theorem (specifically, `pow(N, p - 2, p)`), but does not utilize M, K, or the reading times in its computation.
