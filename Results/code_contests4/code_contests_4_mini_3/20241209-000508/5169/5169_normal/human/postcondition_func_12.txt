The function accepts no parameters directly and returns the integer result of the function `func_12()`, which is expected to be calculated based on the integers N, M, and K, and the lists A and B representing the reading times for books on desks A and B. The behavior of `func_12()` is not defined in the provided code, so any specific logic or outcomes from that function cannot be determined here.
