The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from the output of the function `func_12()` after splitting its result on whitespace characters and converting each resulting substring to an integer. However, the actual behavior of `func_14` depends on the implementation of `func_12()`, which is not provided, so the specific values and count of integers returned cannot be determined without that information.
