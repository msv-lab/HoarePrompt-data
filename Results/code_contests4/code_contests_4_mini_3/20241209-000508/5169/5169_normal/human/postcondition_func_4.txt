The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers (N, M, K) and returns an empty list if N is less than 2. If N is 2 or greater, it returns a list of all prime numbers up to N starting with 2. The function does not utilize the values of M, K, or the lists A and B, making them irrelevant to its functionality.
