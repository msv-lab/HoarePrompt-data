n is a tuple containing three elements: the first element is an integer N (1 <= N <= 200000), the second element is an integer M (1 <= M <= 200000), the third element is an integer K (1 <= K <= 10^9); followed by two lists of integers A and B of lengths N and M respectively, where each element A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^9) and B_i (1 <= B_i <= 10^9).
