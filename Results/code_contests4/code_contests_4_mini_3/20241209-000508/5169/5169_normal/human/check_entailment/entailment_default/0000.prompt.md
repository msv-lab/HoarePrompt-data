You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.

It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).

Consider the following action:

* Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.



How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
B_1 B_2 \ldots B_M


Output

Print an integer representing the maximum number of books that can be read.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(mod=mod):
    """ returns two lists, factorial and inverse factorial modulo argument by default 10**9 +7 """
    fact = [1]
    for i in range(1, 200005):
        fact.append(fact[-1] * i % mod)
    ifact = [0] * 200005
    ifact[200004] = pow(fact[200004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(200004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
    return (fact, ifact)
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts an integer `mod` and returns two lists: the first list contains the factorials of integers from 0! to 200004! modulo `mod`, and the second list contains the modular inverses of these factorials from 0! to 200004! modulo `mod`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, p):
    """ returns N inverse modulo p """
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers (N, M, K) and a tuple `p` containing two lists of integers representing reading times for books on desks A and B. It returns the result of computing the modular inverse of N modulo p using Fermat's Little Theorem (specifically, `pow(N, p - 2, p)`), but does not utilize M, K, or the reading times in its computation.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    """ takes 4 arguments: n , r and factorial and inverse factorial lists"""
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % MOD % MOD
    return t
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts non-negative integers `n` and `r`, along with two lists `fact` and `ifact`. It attempts to calculate a value based on the factorial and inverse factorial at indices `n` and `r`. However, if `n` or `r` is greater than the respective lengths of `fact` and `ifact`, or if `n - r` is negative, the function will result in an index out of range error and will not return a value. Therefore, the function's execution is contingent on avoiding such index errors.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(Sum):
    """this function returns the maximum n for which Summation(n) <= Sum"""
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2
    return ans
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `Sum`, which is expected to represent the total reading time. It calculates and returns the maximum integer `n` such that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is less than or equal to `Sum`, using the formula `(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2`. The function does not handle cases where `Sum` is negative or non-integer, as these scenarios are not validated in the code.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(n):
    """ returns a list of prime numbers till n """
    if n < 2:
        return list()
    prime = [True for _ in range(n + 1)]
    p = 3

    r = [2]
    for p in range(3, n + 1, 2):
        if prime[p]:
            r.append(p)
    return r
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers (N, M, K) and returns an empty list if N is less than 2. If N is 2 or greater, it returns a list of all prime numbers up to N starting with 2. The function does not utilize the values of M, K, or the lists A and B, making them irrelevant to its functionality.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(n, start=1):
    """ returns a list of all divisors till n """
    divisors = []
    for i in range(start, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n / i == i:
                divisors.append(i)
            else:
                divisors.extend([i, n // i])
    return divisors
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and an optional positive integer `start` (defaulting to 1) and returns a list of all positive divisors of `n`. It iterates from `start` to the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility and including both the divisor and its complement if they are different. If `n` is 0, the behavior is not explicitly handled, and it may lead to unexpected results since 0 has infinitely many divisors. Additionally, if `start` is greater than `n`, the function will return an empty list.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n, primes):
    """ returns the number of divisors, two arguments n and the sieve till n """
    divs_number = 1
    for i in primes:
        if n == 1:
            return divs_number
        t = 1
        while n % i == 0:
            t += 1
            n //= i
        divs_number *= t
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a list of prime numbers `primes`. It calculates the number of divisors of `n` by counting the multiplicities of its prime factors as given in the `primes` list. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 immediately. For each prime in the list, it increases a counter `t` for every time it divides `n` by that prime, and then multiplies `divs_number` by `t`. If `n` is not divisible by any primes in the list, the function will ultimately return a count based on the factors found; if `n` is 0, it will return 0 since the loop won't execute.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(d, x, default=-1):
    """ Takes 2 arguments an iterable and an element. returns a tuple (firstoccurence,lastoccurence) -1 if not found """

            right = i
    if left == -1:
        return (default, default)
    else:
        return (left, right)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a tuple `d`, an integer `x`, and a value `default`. It searches for `x` in the tuple `d` and returns its first and last occurrence indices. If `x` is not found, it returns `default` for both indices. The function does not account for cases where `d` might be empty or when `x` appears multiple times in a way that could lead to invalid index behavior.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    """ returns greatest common divisor of x and y """
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts a tuple `x` containing three integers and a tuple `y` containing two lists of integers. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first elements of the tuples in `x` and `y`. The function does not utilize the lists in `y`, which may lead to confusion based on the annotations. The implementation solely focuses on the first elements of the tuples, disregarding any other values or lists present.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a):
    """ returns True/False """
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a tuple `a`, which includes reading times and book counts. It checks if the elements in the tuple (excluding the last two elements) are in non-decreasing order. It returns `False` if any pair of consecutive elements is found to be out of order; otherwise, it returns `True`. The function does not utilize the book counts or the maximum reading time and only evaluates the reading times based on the conditions specified.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n, k=1):
    return n // k + (n % k != 0)
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` representing the total number of books and `k` representing the maximum time in minutes allowed. It calculates and returns the number of complete time segments of `k` minutes required to read `n` books, adding one additional segment if there are any remaining books after dividing `n` by `k`. If `k` is zero, the function will likely lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code. Consequently, the function may not behave as expected if `k` is zero.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a line of input from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. It does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to input reading.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    return int(func_12())
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts no parameters directly and returns the integer result of the function `func_12()`, which is expected to be calculated based on the integers N, M, and K, and the lists A and B representing the reading times for books on desks A and B. The behavior of `func_12()` is not defined in the provided code, so any specific logic or outcomes from that function cannot be determined here.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    return map(int, func_12().split())
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from the output of the function `func_12()` after splitting its result on whitespace characters and converting each resulting substring to an integer. However, the actual behavior of `func_14` depends on the implementation of `func_12()`, which is not provided, so the specific values and count of integers returned cannot be determined without that information.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    return list(map(int, func_12().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. These integers are derived from the output of the function `func_12()`, which is expected to return a string of space-separated values. The returned list consists of the integer representations of these values. The exact integers in the list depend on the implementation of `func_12()`.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    return func_12().split()
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the result of `func_12()` split into a list of strings. The actual behavior of `func_12()` is not provided, so the details of its return value and any potential edge cases related to it are unknown. Therefore, the functionality depends entirely on the implementation of `func_12()`.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // func_9(a, b)
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts a tuple `a` containing three integers and a tuple `b` containing two lists of integers. It calculates the absolute product of the elements in tuple `a` and `b`, then divides this product by the result of another function, `func_9`, applied to the same tuples. The final result is an integer, and the function assumes that `func_9` returns a non-zero value to avoid division by zero errors. If `func_9` returns zero, this will lead to a runtime error.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18(a, sep=' ', end='\n'):
    print(sep.join(map(str, a)), end=end)
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function accepts a string `a` containing space-separated integers, a string `sep` for separating the integers in the output, and a string `end` for the ending character of the print statement. It prints the elements of `a` joined by `sep` and ends with `end`. The function does not perform any calculations or determine reading capabilities; it simply formats and prints the input string.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    return defaultdict(int)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a defaultdict of type int, which initializes default values to 0 for any missing keys. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities since the function's sole purpose is to create and return an empty defaultdict.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_20():
    return defaultdict(list)
''' 

 Output decription for function20:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a defaultdict of lists, which is a dictionary-like object that initializes nonexistent keys with empty lists. There are no additional computations or checks performed in this function.
Function number 21 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_21(s):
    return sys.stdout.write(s)
''' 

 Output decription for function21:  The function accepts a tuple `s` that contains two integers `N` and `M` representing the number of books on desks A and B, an integer `K` representing the maximum time allowed to read books, and two lists `A` and `B` containing the reading times for each book on their respective desks. The function returns the same tuple `s` as its output. However, it does not perform any processing or checks related to the reading times or the maximum time `K`.
Function number 22 :
 Code:

 Output decription for function22:  The function processes two lists of positive integers, A and B, and counts how many elements can be selected from both lists without the total time exceeding a given limit K. It first selects elements from both lists in a way that prioritizes the smaller element, and if it cannot add any more elements without exceeding K, it reports the count of successfully added elements. If not all elements can be added without exceeding K, it still counts and returns how many were successfully added from both lists. The function does not accept any parameters and prints the count of selectable elements directly. The function does not handle cases where either list is empty or K is less than the smallest element in both lists.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
