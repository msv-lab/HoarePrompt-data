You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.

It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).

Consider the following action:

* Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.



How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
B_1 B_2 \ldots B_M

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`ptr1` is equal to `n` or `ptr2` is equal to `m`. If `check` is False, then `totaltime` is the sum of selected elements from `A` and `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is the total number of elements selected from both lists, and the value of `count` is printed, indicating that the loop terminated due to exceeding `K`. If `check` is True, then `ptr1` is the index of the first element in `A` that cannot be added without exceeding `K`, `totaltime` is the sum of selected elements from `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is the total number of elements selected from list `B`, `check` indicates whether all elements were added without exceeding `K`, and `ptr2` is equal to `m` if all elements were added, or the index of the first element in `B` that could not be added without exceeding `K`; `count` is printed.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
