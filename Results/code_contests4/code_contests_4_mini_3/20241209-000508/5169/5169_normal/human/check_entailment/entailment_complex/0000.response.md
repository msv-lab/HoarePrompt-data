Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of books that can be read from desks A and B within a specified time limit K. 

Here are the reasons for the incorrectness:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Time Constraints**: 
   - The function `func_22` attempts to read books alternately from both lists A and B based on their reading times. However, it has a flawed logic in deciding which book to read next. It only checks if the current book from either list can be added without exceeding K, but it does not consider the total time spent if it reads from the other list later. This greedy approach can lead to suboptimal selections.
   - For example, if a book from list A has a reading time that almost reaches K, while a book from list B has a much smaller reading time, the algorithm might choose to read from A first and miss out on the opportunity to read multiple cheaper books from B within the time limit.

2. **Failure to Maximize Book Count**: 
   - The logic does not effectively maximize the total number of books read. The program might prematurely terminate when it finds that adding a book would exceed K, without exploring the possibility of reading books from the other list.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The annotations state that the program checks whether the total time exceeds K after each addition of a book. However, it doesn't account for the scenario where it could have chosen a different sequence of books that would have allowed for more books to be read within the same time limit.

In summary, the algorithm's greedy selection does not ensure that all combinations of reading orders are explored, which is critical in achieving the maximum number of books read. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description, resulting in an overall incorrect implementation.
