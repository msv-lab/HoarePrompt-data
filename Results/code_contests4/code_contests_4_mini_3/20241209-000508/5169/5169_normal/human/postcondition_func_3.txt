The function accepts a non-negative integer `Sum`, which is expected to represent the total reading time. It calculates and returns the maximum integer `n` such that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is less than or equal to `Sum`, using the formula `(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2`. The function does not handle cases where `Sum` is negative or non-integer, as these scenarios are not validated in the code.
