The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K`; `check` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
