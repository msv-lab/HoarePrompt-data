Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` does not exceed `K`, then `totaltime` has been increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` has been increased by 1, and `ptr2` has been incremented by 1 while ensuring `ptr2` is less than `m` and `m` is greater than `ptr2`. Otherwise, `totaltime` has been increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` has been increased by 1, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `m` must be greater than `ptr2`, and `check` is set to False, causing a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
