Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n - 1`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr1` is increased by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ptr1` remains less than `n - 1`, `check` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
