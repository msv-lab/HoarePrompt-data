The value of `ptr1` is incremented by 1, and previously `ptr1` was less than `n - 1`. The values of `totaltime` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is now increased by 1; `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`; `count` is increased by 1 and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ptr1` is now increased by 1; `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`; `count` is increased by 1 and remains unchanged.**
