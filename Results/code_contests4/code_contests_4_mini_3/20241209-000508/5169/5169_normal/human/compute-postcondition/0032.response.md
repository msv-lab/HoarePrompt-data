The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `ptr1` or `ptr2`, which are still less than `n` and `m`, respectively, allowing the loop to continue executing. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is `False`.

Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is `False`**
