Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A_i` (1 <= `i` <= `N`) is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9; `B` is a list of `M` integers where each `B_i` (1 <= `i` <= `M`) is a positive integer such that 1 <= `B_i` <= 10^9; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values returned by `func_14()`; `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`**.
