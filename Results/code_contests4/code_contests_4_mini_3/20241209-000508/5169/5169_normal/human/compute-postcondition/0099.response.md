Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `totaltime` has been increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` has been increased by 1, and `ptr2` has been incremented by 1; otherwise, `check` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
