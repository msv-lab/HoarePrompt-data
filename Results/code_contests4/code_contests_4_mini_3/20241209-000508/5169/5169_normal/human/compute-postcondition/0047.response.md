The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime + a[ptr1]` must be less than or equal to `k` or `totaltime + b[ptr2]` must be less than or equal to `k`; `check` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop.
