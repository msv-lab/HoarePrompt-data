Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K`, `totaltime` has been increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` has been increased by 1, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `m` must be greater than `ptr2`; `check` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
