Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and either `totaltime + a[ptr1]` or `totaltime + b[ptr2]` must be less than or equal to `k`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr1` is increased by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, and `count` is increased by 1. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr2` is increased by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1. If neither condition is satisfied, `check` is set to False, and the most internal loop is exited.***
