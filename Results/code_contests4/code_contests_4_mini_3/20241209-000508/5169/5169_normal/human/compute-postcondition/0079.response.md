The value of `ptr1` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `ptr1` is less than `n - 1`, which allows for the increment. The previous values of `totaltime` and `count` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is increased by 1; `totaltime` remains increased by `a[ptr1]`; `count` remains increased by 1.

Output State: **`ptr1` is increased by 1; `totaltime` remains increased by `a[ptr1]`; `count` remains increased by 1**
