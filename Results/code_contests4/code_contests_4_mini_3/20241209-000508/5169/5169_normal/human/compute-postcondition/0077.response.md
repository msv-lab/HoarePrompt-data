The value of `totaltime` is incremented by the value of `a[ptr1]`. The variable `ptr1` is guaranteed to be less than `n - 1`, but the specific values of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` are not provided, so they remain unchanged except for the addition to `totaltime`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n - 1; `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`.

Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n - 1; `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`**
