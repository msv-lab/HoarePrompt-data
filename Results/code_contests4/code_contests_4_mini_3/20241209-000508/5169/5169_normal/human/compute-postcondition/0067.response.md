The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop in which we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `totaltime` is the sum of selected elements from `A` and `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is the total number of elements selected from both lists, `check` is False, and the sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` is greater than `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
