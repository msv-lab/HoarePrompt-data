The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. The values of `ptr1`, `totaltime`, `count`, and `ptr2` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K`, `totaltime` has been increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` has been increased by 1, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `m` must be greater than `ptr2`.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K`, `totaltime` has been increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` has been increased by 1, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `m` must be greater than `ptr2`; `check` is False.**
