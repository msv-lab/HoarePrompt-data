Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K` or `n` if all were added. If `totaltime` plus `b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `totaltime` is updated to include the element at `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, `check` is set based on whether all elements were added without exceeding `K`, and `ptr2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `totaltime` remains the sum of selected elements from `A` that do not exceed `K`, `count` remains unchanged, `check` is set to False, and the sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is greater than `K`, causing a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
