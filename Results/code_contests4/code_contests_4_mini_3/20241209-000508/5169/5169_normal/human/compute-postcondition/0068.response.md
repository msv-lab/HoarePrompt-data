Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n`, `totaltime` is the sum of selected elements from `A` and `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is the total number of elements selected from both lists, and `check` is True if `totaltime` plus the element at index `ptr1` of list `a` is less than or equal to `K`, while `ptr1` is increased by 1 and `count` is increased by 1. If the sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` exceeds `K`, `check` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
