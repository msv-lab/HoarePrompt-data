The value of `ptr2` is incremented by 1. The previous values indicate that `ptr2` is less than `m`, so after execution, `ptr2` will still be less than `m` (now it is one more than its previous value). The states of `totaltime` and `count` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is now one more than its previous value, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is now one more than its previous value, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1**
