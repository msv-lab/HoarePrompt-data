Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K` or `n` if all were added, `totaltime` is the sum of selected elements from `A` that do not exceed `K` plus the element at `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, `check` is False if not all elements were added without exceeding `K`, otherwise True, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `totaltime` plus the element at `b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `K`.**
