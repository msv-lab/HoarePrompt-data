Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr1` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, and `count` is increased by 1. If the condition does not hold and `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is `False`, the execution breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, if `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr2` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1. If the condition does not hold, `ptr1` remains less than `n`, `ptr2` remains less than `m`, `check` is set to `False`, and the loop or if statement terminates.***
