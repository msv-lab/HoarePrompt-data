Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr1` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is `False`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
