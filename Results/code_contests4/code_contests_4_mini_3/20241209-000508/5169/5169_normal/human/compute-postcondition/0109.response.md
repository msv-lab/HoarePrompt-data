Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to `n` or `ptr2` is equal to `m`. If `check` is False, then `totaltime` is the sum of selected elements from `A` and `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is the total number of elements selected from both lists, and the value of `count` is printed, indicating that the loop terminated due to exceeding `K`. If `check` is True, then `ptr1` is the index of the first element in `A` that cannot be added without exceeding `K`, `totaltime` is the sum of selected elements from `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is the total number of elements selected from list `B`, `check` indicates whether all elements were added without exceeding `K`, and `ptr2` is equal to `m` if all elements were added, or the index of the first element in `B` that could not be added without exceeding `K`; `count` is printed.***
