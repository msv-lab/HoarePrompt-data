Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr2` is increased by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is greater than `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `check` is set to False.***
