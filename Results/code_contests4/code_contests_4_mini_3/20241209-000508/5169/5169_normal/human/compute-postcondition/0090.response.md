Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that cannot be added without exceeding `K` or `n` if all were added; `totaltime` is the sum of selected elements from `A` that do not exceed `K`; `count` is the total number of elements selected from list `A`; `check` is False; the sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is greater than `K`; `check` is now set to False.**
