Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr2` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` exceeds `k`, `ptr1` remains less than `n`, `ptr2` remains less than `m`, `check` is set to `False`, and the loop or if statement terminates.***
