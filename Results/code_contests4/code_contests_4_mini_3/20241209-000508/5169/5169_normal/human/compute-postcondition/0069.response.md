To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `ptr1 < n`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `ptr1` is currently less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `ptr1` needs to remain less than `n` after the next iteration. Since `ptr1` is increased by 1 during each iteration, this means that `ptr1` must be less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we must adjust the state of `ptr1` to be less than or equal to `n - 1`. No other states need to be modified based on the information provided.

State: **`ptr1` is less than `n - 1`**
