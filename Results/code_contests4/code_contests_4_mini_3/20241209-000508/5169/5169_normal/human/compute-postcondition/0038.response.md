The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `ptr1` and `ptr2` are unchanged, and the conditions for the loop to execute again remain valid since `ptr1` is still less than `n` and `ptr2` is still less than `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is `False`.

Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is `False**.
