Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A_i` (1 <= `i` <= `N`) is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9; `B` is a list of `M` integers where each `B_i` (1 <= `i` <= `M`) is a positive integer such that 1 <= `B_i` <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is greater than 0; `k` is assigned values returned by `func_14()`; `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15(); ptr1 is 0; ptr2 is 1; `totaltime` is assigned the value `totaltime + b[0]`; `check` is True; `count` is 1; the value of `A[ptr1]` is greater than or equal to `B[0]` and `totaltime + b[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, or if the sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is greater than `k`, then `ptr1` remains 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is False, `count` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
