The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `B` is a list of `M` integers; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is greater than 0; `k` is assigned values returned by `func_14()`; `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15(); ptr1 is 0; ptr2 is 0; `totaltime` is 0; `check` is False; `count` is 0; the value of `A[ptr1]` is less than the value of `B[ptr2]`; and it is not the case that `totaltime + A[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `K` (i.e., `totaltime + A[ptr1]` is greater than `K`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
