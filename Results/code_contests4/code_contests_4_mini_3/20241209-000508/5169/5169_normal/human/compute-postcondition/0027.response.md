Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A_i` (1 <= `i` <= `N`) is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9; `B` is a list of `M` integers where each `B_i` (1 <= `i` <= `M`) is a positive integer such that 1 <= `B_i` <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is greater than 0; `k` is assigned values returned by `func_14()`; `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15();` if `A[ptr1]` is less than `B[ptr2]`, then `ptr1` is updated to 1, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is updated to `totaltime + A[0]`, `check` is True, `count` is 1, and the condition `totaltime + A[0] <= k` holds. Otherwise, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, and `check` are reset to 0, `totaltime` is 0, `count` is 0, and the values indicate that `A[ptr1]` is less than `B[ptr2]` while `totaltime + A[ptr1]` exceeds `K`, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Conversely, if `A[ptr1]` is greater than or equal to `B[ptr2]`, then `ptr1` remains 0, `ptr2` is updated to 1, `totaltime` is increased by `B[0]`, `check` is True, `count` is 1, and either `totaltime + b[0] <= k` holds, or if the sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` exceeds `k`, the values are reset with `ptr1` at 0, `ptr2` at 0, `totaltime` at 0, `check` at False, `count` at 0, indicating a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
