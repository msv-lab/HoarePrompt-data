The value of `ptr1` is incremented by 1, while the values of `ptr2`, `totaltime`, and `count` remain unchanged. The previous state indicates that `ptr1` is less than `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is incremented by 1, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ptr1` is incremented by 1, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
