The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` representing the total number of books and `k` representing the maximum time in minutes allowed. It calculates and returns the number of complete time segments of `k` minutes required to read `n` books, adding one additional segment if there are any remaining books after dividing `n` by `k`. If `k` is zero, the function will likely lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code. Consequently, the function may not behave as expected if `k` is zero.
