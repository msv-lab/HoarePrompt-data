Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where both desks have books, and the total reading time exceeds the allowed time `K`. 

Consider the following input case:

```
2 2 100
50 60
50 60
```

In this case, the optimal way to read the books is to read both books from Desk A (50 + 60 = 110), which exceeds the limit of `K = 100`. The code incorrectly assumes that it can read the top book from both desks based on their individual reading times without considering the total time constraint correctly when both desks have books.

The current implementation has a logic flaw in choosing which books to read, as it doesn't backtrack or reconsider after an initial choice, leading to incorrect counts in situations where the sum of the smallest books from both desks exceeds `K`. 

Thus, the program fails to account for the correct maximum number of books that can be read within the total time limit `K`.
