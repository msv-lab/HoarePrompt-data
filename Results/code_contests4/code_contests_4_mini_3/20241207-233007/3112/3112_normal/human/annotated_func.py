#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, the string s has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) consisting only of characters 'R', 'S', or 'P'. The total length of all strings across test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    range = xrange
    input = raw_input
    mapper = {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        S = [mapper[c] for c in input()]
        
        count = [0] * 3
        
        for s in S:
            count[s] += 1
        
        maxi = max(range(3), key=count.__getitem__)
        
        maxi -= 2
        
        print('RPS'[maxi]) * len(S)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is equal to the total counts of occurrences of 'R', 'P', and 'S' in string `s`; `S` is a list of integers derived from `s`; `mapper` is {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}; `maxi` is the index of the most frequent character in 'RPS' after processing all `t` iterations; output is the character from 'RPS' indexed by `maxi` multiplied by the length of `S` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a string consisting of the characters 'R', 'P', and 'S'. For each string, it counts the occurrences of these characters, determines which character appears the most frequently, and then prints that character repeated for the length of the string. In the case of a tie, it will always print 'R' because of the way `max` is implemented. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
