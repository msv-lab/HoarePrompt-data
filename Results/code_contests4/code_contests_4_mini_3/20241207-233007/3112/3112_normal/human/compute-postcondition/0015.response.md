The value of `maxi` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `maxi` could be 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `maxi` could be -2, -1, or 0. The states of the other variables (`count`, `S`, `mapper`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`count` is equal to the count of occurrences of 'R', 'P', and 'S' in string `s`; `S` is a list of integers derived from `s`; `mapper` is {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}; `maxi` is -2, -1, or 0 depending on the previous value**
