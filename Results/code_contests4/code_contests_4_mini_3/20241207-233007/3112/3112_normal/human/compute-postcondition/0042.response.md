Output State: **`count` is updated to reflect the number of occurrences of each character in `S`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum value in the range(3) based on the count of occurrences, `s` is the last element in `S`, and `maxi` is decreased by 2; the output of the print statement is a string formed by repeating the character at index `maxi` (after decrement) in 'RPS' for `len(S)` times.**
