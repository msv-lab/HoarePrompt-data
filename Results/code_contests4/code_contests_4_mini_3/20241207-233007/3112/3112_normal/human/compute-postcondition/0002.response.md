The variable `mapper` is assigned a dictionary that maps the characters 'R', 'P', and 'S' to the integers 0, 1, and 2, respectively. This assignment does not change the values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, and `range`), but it establishes a new mapping for these characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) consisting only of characters 'R', 'S', or 'P'; `range` is now an alias for `xrange`; `mapper` is {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}.
