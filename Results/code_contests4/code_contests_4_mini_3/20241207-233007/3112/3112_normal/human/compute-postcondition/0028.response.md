The value of `maxi` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `maxi` is not specified, but its effect is that `maxi` will now reflect a new index that is 2 less than its previous value. As the value of `count` is not affected and remains unchanged, the output state reflects the change to `maxi`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is updated to reflect the total counts of each corresponding index in `S`, `maxi` is updated to be 2 less than its previous value.

Output State: **`count` is updated to reflect the total counts of each corresponding index in `S`, `maxi` is updated to be 2 less than its previous value.**
