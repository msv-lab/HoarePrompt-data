Output State: **`count` is equal to the total counts of occurrences of 'R', 'P', and 'S' in string `s`; `S` is a list of integers derived from `s`; `mapper` is {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}; `maxi` is the index of the most frequent character in 'RPS' after processing all `t` iterations; output is the character from 'RPS' indexed by `maxi` multiplied by the length of `S` for each iteration.**
