The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a string consisting of the characters 'R', 'P', and 'S'. For each string, it counts the occurrences of these characters, determines which character appears the most frequently, and then prints that character repeated for the length of the string. In the case of a tie, it will always print 'R' because of the way `max` is implemented. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
