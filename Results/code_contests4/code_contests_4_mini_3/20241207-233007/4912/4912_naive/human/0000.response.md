Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description. The problem is to extract the name of the festival from a given string that ends with "FESTIVAL". However, the code seems to be written for a completely different problem related to counting patterns in binary strings.

For example, if the input is "CODEFESTIVAL", the expected output is "CODE", but this program will not produce any relevant output for this input as it processes the string in a way that does not align with the requirements. The logic implemented in the code does not address the task of extracting the substring before "FESTIVAL".

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the specification laid out in the problem description.
