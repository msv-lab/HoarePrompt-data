The provided problem description requires a Python function that extracts the festival name from the string `S`, which ends with `FESTIVAL`. The expected output is the substring of `S` that appears before the "FESTIVAL" suffix.

The code provided, however, does not relate to this problem description. Instead, it processes an integer and a string, attempting to perform a count of occurrences of '1's and certain calculations regarding substrings of '1's and '0's, completely unrelated to extracting a festival name from a given string.

The output hints also do not correspond to the task at hand. They describe a counting mechanism involving binary strings, which is unrelated to the requirement of extracting a substring that ends with "FESTIVAL".

Given that the code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described, and there is a fundamental mismatch between the code and the problem description, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to meet the problem requirements, as it does not address the logic needed to extract the festival name from the string `S`.
