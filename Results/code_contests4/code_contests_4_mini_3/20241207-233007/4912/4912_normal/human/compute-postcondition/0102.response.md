Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by `temp`, `f` is an empty list, `res` contains more elements, `x` is the next element from `res`, and `m` is the length of `x`. If `m` is equal to 4, the function will execute the block resulting in an error due to accessing out of bounds for `x` if `m` is equal to 3. If `m` is not equal to 4, the preconditions remain unchanged.***
