The value of `tar` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `tar` is `1`, so it is updated from `1` to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `res` is now a list containing a copy of `temp`, `count` is 0, `one` is set to 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `s`, `temp` is [], `tar` is now 0, and `i` is 1 with `s[i]` being '0' while the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+2` does not equal '101'.
