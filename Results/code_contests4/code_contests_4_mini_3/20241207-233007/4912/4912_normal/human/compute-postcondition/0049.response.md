The variable `tar` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `tar` was `1` or `0` depending on the previous condition, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. Other variables, including `S`, `n`, `s`, `temp`, `i`, and `count`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `temp` is an empty list, `tar` is 0, `i` is 3, `count` remains 0, and `res` is updated to include a copy of the previous `temp`.
