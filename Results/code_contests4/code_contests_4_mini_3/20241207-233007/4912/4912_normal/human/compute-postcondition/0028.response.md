Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, and `s` is an input string. If the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+2` is equal to '101', then `temp` is now a list containing `0`, `tar` is 1, `i` is 1, and `count` remains 0. Otherwise, `res` is a list containing a copy of `temp`, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 2 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `tar` is now 0, and `i` is 1 with `s[i]` being either '1' or '0'.***
