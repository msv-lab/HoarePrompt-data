The variable `one` is assigned the value `0`. Since `one` was already `0` based on the initial state, there is no change in the value of `one`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `res` is a list containing a copy of `temp`, `count` is 0, `one` is 0, `temp` is [], `tar` is now 0, and `i` is 1 with `s[i]` being '0'.
