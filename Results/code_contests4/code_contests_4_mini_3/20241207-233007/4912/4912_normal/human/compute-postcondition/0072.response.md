Postcondition: ***`res` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of `res`, `temp` is the maximum of `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]` since `m` is equal to 3, and `f` is an empty list. If `m` is not equal to 3, `temp` remains the maximum of `x[0]` and `x[1]` if `m` was initially equal to 2, while `f` remains an empty list.***
