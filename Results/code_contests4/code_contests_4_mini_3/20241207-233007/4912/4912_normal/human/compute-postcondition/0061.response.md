The code `res.append(temp.copy())` appends a copy of the list `temp` to the list `res`. The variable `res` will now contain an additional sub-list that is a copy of `temp`, while the contents of `temp` remain unchanged. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `res` is a list containing additional sub-lists of counts of '1's before '101' sequences, `temp` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `one` is incremented by 1, `tar` is 1, and the last character of `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `res` contains an additional sub-list copied from `temp`, `temp` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `one` is incremented by 1, `tar` is 1, and the last character of `s` is '1'.**
