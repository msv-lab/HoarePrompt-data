The value of `one` is appended to the list `temp`. Since `temp` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `temp` will contain the value of `one`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `temp` is now a list containing `one`, `tar` is set to 1 or 0 depending on the previous condition, `i` is 3, and `count` remains 0.
