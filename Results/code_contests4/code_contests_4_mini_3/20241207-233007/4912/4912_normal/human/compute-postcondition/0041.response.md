Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, and `temp` is an empty list. If `s[i - 1:i + 2]` equals '101', then `temp` contains `one`, `tar` is set to 1, `i` is 2, `count` remains 0, and `one` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty list, `tar` is 0, `i` is 2, `count` remains 0, and if `s[2]` is '1', then `one` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `s[2]` is '0' and `tar` is 1, `temp` includes a copy of `temp`, and `one` is set to 0.***
