The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value among `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`. The values of `x` are not specified, but `temp` will hold the highest of these three values. The states of other variables (`count`, `f`, `res`, and `m`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is incremented by `temp`, `f` is an empty list, `res` contains more elements, `x` will be the next element in `res`, and `temp` is the maximum of `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by `temp`, `f` is an empty list, `res` contains more elements, `x` will be the next element in `res`, and `temp` is the maximum of `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]**.
