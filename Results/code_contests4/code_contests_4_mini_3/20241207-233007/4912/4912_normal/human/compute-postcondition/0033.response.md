The code `temp.append(one)` appends the value of `one` to the list `temp`. However, the value of `one` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the list `temp` is updated with an undefined value.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `temp` is updated to include an undefined value, `tar` is 0, `i` is 2, and `count` remains 0.**
