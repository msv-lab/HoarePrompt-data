The code initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered by this assignment, but `temp` is now reset to an empty list. The output state should reflect this change. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `res` is now a list containing a copy of `temp`, `count` is 0, `one` is set to 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `s`, `temp` is [], `tar` is 0, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+2` does not equal '101', `s[i]` is '0' while `tar` is 1.**
