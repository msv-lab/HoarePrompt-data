The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list, which means it is now reset and no longer contains any previous values. The other variables (`S`, `n`, `s`, `tar`, `i`, `count`, and `res`) remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `temp` is an empty list, `tar` is set to 1 or 0 depending on the previous condition, `i` is 3, `count` remains 0, and `res` is updated to include a copy of the previous `temp`.
