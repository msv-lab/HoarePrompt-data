The value of `one` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `one` is either 0 or 1, so after execution, `one` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `res` is a list containing a copy of `temp`, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 2, `temp` is [], `tar` is now 0, and `i` is 1 with `s[i]` being '1' while the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+2` does not equal '101'.
