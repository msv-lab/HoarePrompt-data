Postcondition: ***`res` is a non-empty list. If `m` is equal to 4, `temp` is the maximum of `x[0] + x[2]` and `x[3] + max(x[0], x[1])`, and `f` remains an empty list. If `m` is not equal to 4, `temp` is the maximum of `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]` if `m` is equal to 3, or the maximum of `x[0]` and `x[1]` if `m` was initially equal to 2, while `f` remains an empty list.***
