Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 3, `s` is an input string, if `s[2:5]` equals '101', then `temp` becomes a list containing `one`, `tar` is set to 1, `i` is 3, `count` remains 0, and `one` is now 0. Otherwise, `temp` is an empty list, `count` remains 0, and `one` is increased by 1 if `s[3]` is '1'; if `s[3]` is not '1', then `one` remains 0.***
