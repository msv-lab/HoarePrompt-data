Postcondition: ***`res` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of `res`, `temp` is the maximum of `x[0]` and `x[1]` if `m` is equal to 2, and `f` is an empty list. `m` is equal to 3. If `m` was 2, then `temp` has the value of the maximum of `x[0]` and `x[1]`, otherwise `temp` remains unchanged.***
