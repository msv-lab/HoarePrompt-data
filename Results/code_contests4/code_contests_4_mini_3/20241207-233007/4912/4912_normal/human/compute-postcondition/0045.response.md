The value of `one` is assigned to 0. The previous state of `one` was determined by previous conditions, but now it is explicitly set to 0. The other variables `S`, `n`, `s`, `temp`, `tar`, `i`, and `count` remain unaffected in their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `temp` is now a list containing `one`, `tar` is set to 1, `i` is 3, `count` remains 0, and `one` is now 0.
