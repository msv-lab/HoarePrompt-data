The value of `one` is directly assigned to 0, as specified in the code. Since `one` was previously either 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `s`, it is now set to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `res` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `one` is 0, `temp` is now a list containing `one` (which is now 0), `tar` is 1, `i` is 1, and the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+2` is equal to '101'.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `res` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `one` is 0, `temp` is now a list containing `0`, `tar` is 1, `i` is 1, and the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+2` is equal to '101'.**
