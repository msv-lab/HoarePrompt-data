Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `temp` is an empty list, `tar` is 0, `i` is 2, `count` remains 0. If `s[2]` is '1', then `one` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `s[2]` is '0' and `tar` is 1, `res` now includes a copy of `temp`, which is an empty list; and `one` is set to 0.***
