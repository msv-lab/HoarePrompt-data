The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 characters, ending with 'FESTIVAL'. It counts the occurrences of '1's that appear before each occurrence of the substring '101' and sums certain calculated maximum values based on these occurrences. Finally, it prints the total sum of these calculated values. The function does not return any value but instead outputs the result directly.
