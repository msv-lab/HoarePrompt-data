According to the code, the loop is set to execute a fixed number of times, specifically 2 iterations. The variable `j` will take values from 0 to 1 during these iterations. Since `n` does not directly influence the number of iterations of this particular loop, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The state of `i` is also not relevant to the loop as it is not being used within the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the only variable directly involved is `j`, which will start at 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `j` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
