The variable `b` is assigned the value `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[j][1]`. The values of `len(odd)` and `oddc_most_common[j][1]` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `j` is 2. Therefore, the output state cannot specify the exact values of `b` without knowing `len(odd)` and `oddc_most_common[2][1]`. However, we can state that `b` will be computed based on these values.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `a` is computed as len(even) - evenc_most_common[2][1]; `b` is computed as len(odd) - oddc_most_common[2][1]**
