Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and a list `v` of `n` integers (1 ≤ v[i] ≤ 100000). It separates the integers in `v` into even and odd indexed groups, counts the occurrences of each value in those groups, and calculates the minimum number of changes required to make the two groups distinct by finding the sum of elements that need to be changed. It returns this minimum value. **
