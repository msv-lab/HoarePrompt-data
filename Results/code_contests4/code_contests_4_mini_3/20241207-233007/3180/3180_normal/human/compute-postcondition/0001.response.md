The variable `v` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it will hold a map object containing integers obtained from the input string that is split into separate values. The previous state of `n` does not affect `v`, and no other variables are changed in this segment of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `v` is a map object containing integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `v` is a map object containing integers from input.**
