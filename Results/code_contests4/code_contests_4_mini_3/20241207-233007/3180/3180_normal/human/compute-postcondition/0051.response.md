Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `j` is 0. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then `a` is equal to `len(even) - evenc_most_common[2][1]`, `b` is equal to `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[j][1]`, and a new element `a + b` is appended to `m`.***
