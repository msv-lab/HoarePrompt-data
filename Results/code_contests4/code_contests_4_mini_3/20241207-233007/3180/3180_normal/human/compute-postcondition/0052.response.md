According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop is set to iterate for `j` in the range of 2, which means it will execute for `j` values of 0 and 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since the loop executes for the current value of `j`, it will run again for the next value, which is 1. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will need to be incremented to 1. Since the loop will not execute beyond the range specified, this will be the final execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `j` is 1.**
