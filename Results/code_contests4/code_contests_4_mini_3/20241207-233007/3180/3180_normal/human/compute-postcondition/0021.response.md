According to the code, the loop is set to execute twice, as `j` is in the range of 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since the range is from 0 to 1 (inclusive), there will be no more iterations after `j` reaches 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 2, which will not be the case after the current iteration. Therefore, the loop cannot execute a third time.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 2.**
