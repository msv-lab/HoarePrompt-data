Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 0; `j` is 2. If the first element of `evenc_most_common[i]` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common[j]`, then `m` is updated with the value `a + b`, where `a` is `len(even) - evenc_most_common[0][1]` and `b` is `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[2][1]***
