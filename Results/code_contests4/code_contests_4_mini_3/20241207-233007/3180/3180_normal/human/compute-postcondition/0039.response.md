According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of 2, meaning it will execute for `j` values of 0 and 1. Currently, `j` is 1 at the end of the last iteration, indicating that the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 2. However, since the range is defined as `range(2)`, there is no valid value of `j` that would allow the loop to execute again after 1.

Thus, the loop cannot execute a second time because it has already completed its iterations through the defined range. 

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; the loop cannot execute a second time as `j` has reached the end of its range.**
