Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `m` contains values based on the evaluations of the condition for all combinations of `i` and `j`, where each appended value is the sum of `len(even) - evenc_most_common[i][1]` and `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[j][1]` for pairs where the elements at the first indices of `evenc_most_common` and `oddc_most_common` are not equal.**
