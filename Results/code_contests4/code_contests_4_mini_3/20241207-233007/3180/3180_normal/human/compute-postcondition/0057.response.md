According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop is set to iterate over a range of 2, which means it will execute while `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

Since the loop will not execute when `j` is equal to 2 (as the range is 2), the loop cannot execute a third time. Therefore, there are no further iterations possible.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `j` is 2. The loop cannot execute a third time, as `j` must be less than 2.**
