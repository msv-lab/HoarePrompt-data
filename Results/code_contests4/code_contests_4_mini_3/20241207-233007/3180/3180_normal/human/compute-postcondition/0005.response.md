The `oddc` is assigned the value of `collections.Counter(odd)`, which counts the occurrences of each element in the `odd` list. The values of `n`, `even`, `odd`, and `evenc` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `even` is a list containing elements from `v` at even indices; `odd` is a list containing elements from `v` at odd indices; `evenc` is a Counter object containing counts of elements in `even`; `oddc` is a Counter object containing counts of elements in `odd`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `even` is a list containing elements from `v` at even indices; `odd` is a list containing elements from `v` at odd indices; `evenc` is a Counter object containing counts of elements in `even`; `oddc` is a Counter object containing counts of elements in `odd`.**
