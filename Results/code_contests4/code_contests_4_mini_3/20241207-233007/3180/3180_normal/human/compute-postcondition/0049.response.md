Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `j` is 0 in the first iteration; the first element of `evenc_most_common` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common` at index `j`; `a` is equal to `len(even) - evenc_most_common[2][1]; `b` is equal to `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[j][1].**
