The code creates a list `even` that contains elements from the map object `v` where the index `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`). The variable `n` is not directly affected by this operation, but it defines the context for the input values. The values of `v` will determine the contents of `even`. Since `v` contains integers from input and `n` is an even integer, the output state will reflect the creation of the new list based on the map object `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `even` is a list containing elements from `v` at even indices.**
