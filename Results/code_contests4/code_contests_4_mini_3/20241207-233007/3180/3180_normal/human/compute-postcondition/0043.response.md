Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `evenc_most_common[1][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[2][0]`, then `a` is calculated as the length of `even` minus `evenc_most_common[1][1]`, `b` is the length of `odd` minus `oddc_most_common[2][1]`, and `m` is updated to append the value of `a + b`.***
