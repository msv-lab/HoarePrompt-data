Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 0; `j` is 1. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then `m` is updated by appending the sum of `a` and `b`, where `a` is `len(even) - evenc_most_common[i][1]` and `b` is `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[j][1]***.
