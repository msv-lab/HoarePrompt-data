The function `func` does not directly accept any parameters through its signature, but it operates on two inputs: `n` and `v`. Here, `n` is an even integer constrained such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100000 \), and `v` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100000.

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the prompt, but based on the constraints provided, we can infer that the function likely processes the list `v` in relation to the integer `n`. However, since the output details are not given, we cannot ascertain the specific return values or conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts `n`, an even integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and `v`, a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ v[i] ≤ 100000 for each i).**
