To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Requirements
1. **Game of Nim**: The game involves `N` piles of stones, with each pile containing `a_i` stones.
2. **Cheater's Move**: The cheater can choose to eat 0 or 1 stone from each pile before the game starts.
3. **Objective**: The cheater wants to ensure a win regardless of the cheetah's moves and minimize the number of stones eaten.
4. **Output**: If the cheater can guarantee a win, output the number of stones eaten; otherwise, output `-1`.

### Program Logic
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of piles (`n`) and the number of stones in each pile (`a`).
2. **Binary Representation**: The program calculates the maximum length of the binary representation of the stone counts in the piles.
3. **Count of '1's**: It computes how many times a '1' appears at each bit position across all piles.
4. **XOR Calculation**: The program computes the XOR of all stone counts (`axor`).
5. **Winning Condition**: If `axor` equals `0`, it prints `0`, indicating that the cheater has already lost before starting the game.
6. **Cheating Logic**: The program then iterates through the binary representation of `axor`:
   - If a '1' is found at a position, it checks if there is at least one corresponding '1' in the `cnt` array. If not, it prints `-1` (indicating the cheater cannot guarantee a win).
   - If a corresponding '1' is found, it increments the count of stones eaten (`ans`), adjusts the `cnt`, and modifies `axor`.

### Analysis of Correctness
1. The program correctly identifies the number of stones the cheater must eat to ensure a win by using the properties of XOR in Nim games.
2. It checks for the possibility of winning by validating the presence of '1's in the `cnt` array, which represents the counts of significant bits (i.e., the ability to remove stones).
3. The logic for determining the number of stones to eat is consistent with the requirement to guarantee a win while minimizing the stones eaten.
4. The handling of edge cases, such as when `axor` equals `0`, is appropriately addressed, leading to correct output.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the logic required to determine the number of stones the cheater eats (or the impossibility of winning) based on the rules of the Nim game.

Correctness: **True**
