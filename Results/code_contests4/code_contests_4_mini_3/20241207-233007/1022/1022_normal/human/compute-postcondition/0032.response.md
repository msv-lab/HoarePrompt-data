Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt` is a list of size `mxlba + 5` initialized to all 0s except `cnt[k]` which is now 1 for the highest index `k` such that `bit[k]` is '1', `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 1`, `lb` is greater than 0, and the value of `bit[j]` is '1'.***
