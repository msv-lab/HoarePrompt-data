The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 2; `la` is greater than 1; `ans` is incremented by 1; `cnt[2]` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
