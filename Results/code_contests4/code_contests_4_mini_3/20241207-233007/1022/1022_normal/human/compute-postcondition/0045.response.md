According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is incremented by the number of '1's found in the binary representation of `a[1]`, `cnt[1]` is incremented for the first '1' found to the left of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[2]` is incremented for the second '1' found to the left of `cnt[1]`, and so on, up to `cnt[lb - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
