Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is the total number of integers processed, `i` is 2, and `la` is greater than 1. If `axor[i]` is '1', and if `cnt[i]` is 0, -1 is printed and the program execution is terminated. Otherwise, `tmp` is computed as `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`, `ans` is potentially incremented by 1, `cnt[2]` is decremented by 1, and `axor` is updated to reflect its binary string representation of its previous value. If `axor[i]` is not '1', there are no changes made to the variables.***
