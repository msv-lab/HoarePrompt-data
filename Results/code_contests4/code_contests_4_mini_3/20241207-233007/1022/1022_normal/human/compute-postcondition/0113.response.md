The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but it will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 2; `la` is greater than 1; `ans` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 2; `la` is greater than 1; `ans` is incremented by 1.**
