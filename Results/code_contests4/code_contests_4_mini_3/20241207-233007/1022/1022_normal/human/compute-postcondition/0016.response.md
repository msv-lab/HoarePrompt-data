In the provided code snippet, the expression `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` is modifying the `cnt` list. The variable `j` is defined as `lb - 1`, which means when evaluating `lb - 1 - j`, it simplifies to `lb - 1 - (lb - 1)`, resulting in `0`. Therefore, `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1.

Since `cnt` was initialized to all 0s, the first element (`cnt[0]`) will change from `0` to `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt` is a list of size `mxlba + 5` initialized to all 0s except `cnt[0]` which is now 1, `i` is 0, `bit` is a binary representation of a non-zero integer such that `lb` is at least 1, `j` is `lb - 1`.**
