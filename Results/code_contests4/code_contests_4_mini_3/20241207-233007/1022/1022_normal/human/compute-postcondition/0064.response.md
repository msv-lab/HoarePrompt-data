According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The states before the loop execution indicate that `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, but that does not directly dictate whether the loop will run, as `n` is the variable that controls the loop iterations. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration, and since `axor` is 0, it is not directly relevant to the loop execution condition. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the necessary state adjustments would be:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0**.
