The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. None of the variables are modified during this execution, but the program will stop running. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables before the program terminates.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 1; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0); -1 is printed and the program is terminated.**
