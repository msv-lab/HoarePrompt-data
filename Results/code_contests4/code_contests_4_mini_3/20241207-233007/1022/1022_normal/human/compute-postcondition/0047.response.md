Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is incremented by the number of '1's found in the binary representation of `a[1]`, `cnt[1]` is incremented for the first '1' found to the left of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[2]` is incremented for the second '1' found to the left of `cnt[1]`, and so on, up to `cnt[lb - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, `lb` is the length of `bit`, `bit` is assigned the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is now the length of `bit`.**
