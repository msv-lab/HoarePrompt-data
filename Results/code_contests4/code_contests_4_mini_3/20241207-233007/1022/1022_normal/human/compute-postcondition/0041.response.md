In the given initial state, we have the following information:

- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer.
- `cnt[0]` is now 1 plus the previous value of `cnt[0]`.
- `cnt[1]` is increased by 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `lb - 3`.
- `lb` is greater than or equal to 3.

The code snippet `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` updates the `cnt` array at the index `lb - 1 - j`. 

Calculating `lb - 1 - j`:
- Since `j = lb - 3`, we can substitute this into the expression: 
  `lb - 1 - j = lb - 1 - (lb - 3) = lb - 1 - lb + 3 = 2`.

Thus, the code modifies `cnt[2]` by adding 1 to it.

- The previous values of `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` have been incremented already, but we don't have specific values for them. The key change is that `cnt[2]` is now increased by 1.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes in `cnt` while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is now 1 plus the previous value of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]` is increased by 1, `cnt[2]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 3`, and `lb` is greater than or equal to 3.**
