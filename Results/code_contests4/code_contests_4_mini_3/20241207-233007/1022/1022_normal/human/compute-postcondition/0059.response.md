The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1, affecting `cnt` at index `lb - 1 - j`. Other variables remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
