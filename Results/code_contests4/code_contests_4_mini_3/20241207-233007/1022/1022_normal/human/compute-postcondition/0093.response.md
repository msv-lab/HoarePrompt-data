The variable `axor` is currently an integer in binary form, and the code snippet updates `axor` by converting it back to a binary string representation. The previous state of `axor` is not affected by the conversion, and it is now represented as a binary string without the '0b' prefix.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation which is greater than 0; `ans` is 1; the `i`-th element of `axor` is '1'; `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1 and now is greater than or equal to 0; if `la - i - 1` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2); `axor` is updated by performing `axor = int(axor, 2) ^ tmp; `axor` is now a binary string representation of its previous integer value.**
