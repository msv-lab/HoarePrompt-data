Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 1; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0); `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2), where (la - i - 1) is greater than or equal to 0; `axor` is updated to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `tmp`; `axor` is now represented as a binary string without the '0b' prefix.**
