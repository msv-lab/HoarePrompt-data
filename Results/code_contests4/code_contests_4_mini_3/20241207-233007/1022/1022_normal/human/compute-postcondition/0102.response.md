The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 1; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0); `ans` is increased by 1; `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
