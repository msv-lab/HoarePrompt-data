The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt` is a list of size `mxlba + 5` initialized to all 0s except `cnt[0]` which is now 1 and `cnt[1]` is now 1, `i` is 0, `bit` is a binary representation of a non-zero integer such that `lb` is at least 1, and `j` is `lb - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
