Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0); if `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, the value -1 is printed before exiting. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than or equal to 0; if `la - i - 1` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2); `axor` is updated as `axor = int(axor, 2) ^ tmp` and is now a binary string representation of its previous integer value.***
