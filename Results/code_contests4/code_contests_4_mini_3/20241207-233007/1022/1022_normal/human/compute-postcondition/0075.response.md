The value of `axor` is converted to its binary representation using the `bin()` function, and the `[2:]` slice is used to remove the '0b' prefix that indicates a binary number in Python. The value of `axor` before this operation can vary, but the output depends on its value being non-zero or zero. 

If `axor` is non-zero, it will be represented as a binary string. If `axor` equals 0, as stated, the output should be 0.

Since the output is determined by the binary representation of `axor`, I will conclude with the following output state. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is the total number of integers processed, `i` is `n - 1`; `axor` is the binary representation of the previous `axor` value or 0 if it was zero.**
