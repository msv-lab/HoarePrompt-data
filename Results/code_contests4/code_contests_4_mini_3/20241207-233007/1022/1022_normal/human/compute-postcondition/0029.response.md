The variable `bit` is assigned the binary representation of `a[i]`, converted to a string after removing the '0b' prefix. The value of `a[i]` is not given, but since `i` is initialized to 1, `bit` will represent the binary form of the integer at index 1 of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt` is a list of size `mxlba + 5` initialized to all 0s except `cnt[k]` which is now 1 for the highest index `k` such that `bit[k]` is '1', `i` is 1, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[1]`, and `j` is -1 after the loop completes execution.
