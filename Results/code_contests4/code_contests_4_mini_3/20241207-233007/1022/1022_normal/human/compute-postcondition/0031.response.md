According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lb`, which represents the length of the binary representation `bit`. The loop will iterate from `lb - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `lb` must be greater than `0`, which implies that `bit` must contain at least one '1' in its binary representation.

Given that `j` starts at `lb - 1`, it will be initialized to `lb - 1`, and it will be decremented in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. 

Also, `i` is set to 1 before the loop starts, but its value does not directly affect the execution of the loop. The other variable states (`N`, `n`, `mxlba`, `cnt`, `bit`) are provided and may influence subsequent operations within the loop, but they do not need to be adjusted for the loop execution itself.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `lb` should be greater than 0, and `j` should be initialized to `lb - 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt` is a list of size `mxlba + 5` initialized to all 0s except `cnt[k]` which is now 1 for the highest index `k` such that `bit[k]` is '1', `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 1`, `lb` is greater than 0**
