The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 2; `la` is greater than 1**
