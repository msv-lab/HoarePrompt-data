Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 1; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0). If `axor[i]` is '1' and `cnt[i]` is 0, -1 is printed and the program is terminated. Otherwise, if `axor[i]` is '1' and `cnt[i]` is not 0, `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`; `axor` is updated to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `tmp`, and `axor` is now represented as a binary string without the '0b' prefix. If `axor[i]` is not '1', no changes are made to the program state.***
