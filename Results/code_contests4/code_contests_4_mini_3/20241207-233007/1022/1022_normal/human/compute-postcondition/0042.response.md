The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is now 1 plus the previous value of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]` is increased by 1, `cnt[2]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 3`, and `lb` is greater than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
