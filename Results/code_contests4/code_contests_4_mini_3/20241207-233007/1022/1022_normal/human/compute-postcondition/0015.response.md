Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt` is a list of size `mxlba + 5` initialized to all 0s, `i` is 0, `bit` is a binary representation of a non-zero integer such that `lb` is at least 1, `j` is `lb - 1`, and the `j`-th element of `bit` is '1'.***
