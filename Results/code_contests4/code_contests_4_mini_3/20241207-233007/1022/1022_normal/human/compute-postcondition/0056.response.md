Postcondition: ***If `bit[j]` is '1', then `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is incremented by the number of '1's found in the binary representation of `a[1]`, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[2]` is incremented for the second '1' found to the left of `cnt[1]`, and so on, up to `cnt[lb - 1]`, with `i` set to 2, `j` set to `lb - 2`, and `lb` greater than or equal to 1, while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `bit[j]` is not '1', no changes are made to the `cnt` array in this context.***
