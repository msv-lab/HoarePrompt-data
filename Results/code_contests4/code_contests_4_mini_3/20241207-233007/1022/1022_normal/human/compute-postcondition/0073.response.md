The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately without modifying any variables. Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is the total number of integers processed, `i` is `n - 1`, `axor` is the bitwise XOR of all integers in the array `a` from index 0 to `n - 1`, and the output is 0.
