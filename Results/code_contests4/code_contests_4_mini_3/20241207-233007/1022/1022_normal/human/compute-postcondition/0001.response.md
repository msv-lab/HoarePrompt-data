The list `a` is assigned the values obtained from `int(raw_input())` for `n` times. Since `n` is an input integer, the values in `a` will depend on the user input. The previous state of `N` is not directly affected by this code. However, `a` will contain `n` integers, each of which is the result of `int(raw_input())`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from user input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from user input.**
