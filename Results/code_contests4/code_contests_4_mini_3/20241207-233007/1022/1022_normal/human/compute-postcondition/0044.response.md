After analyzing the provided loop code and the initial state, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as follows:

The loop iterates over the binary representation of `a[1]` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. It increments the count in the `cnt` array for the first encountered '1' bit, starting from the rightmost bit. If there are no '1' bits in the binary representation of `a[1]`, the `cnt` array will remain unchanged beyond its initial state.

Considering that `lb` is the length of the `bit`, the loop will execute until `j` reaches -1, potentially updating `cnt` based on the positions of '1' bits in `bit`. 

If there are at least some '1' bits in `bit`, the output state will be:
- `cnt[0]` will be incremented for the first '1' found.
- For each subsequent '1' found further to the left, corresponding `cnt` indices will be incremented.

If there are no '1' bits in `bit`, then `cnt` will remain unchanged except for the initial condition of `cnt[k]` where `k` is the highest index such that `bit[k]` was '1'.

Therefore, the overall output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is incremented by the number of '1's found in the binary representation of `a[1]`, `cnt[1]` is incremented for the first '1' found to the left of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[2]` is incremented for the second '1' found to the left of `cnt[1]`, and so on, up to `cnt[lb - 1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is -1, `lb` is the length of `bit`.**
