The variable `axor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `tmp`. The variable `tmp` is constructed by taking the binary representation of `1` repeated `la - i - 1` times, and then converting it to an integer. The previous value of `axor` is a binary integer, and this operation will affect its value based on the XOR rules. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation which is greater than 0; `ans` is 1; the `i`-th element of `axor` is '1'; `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1 and now is greater than or equal to 0; if `la - i - 1` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`, which is a binary number represented by `la - i - 1` ones; `axor` is updated by performing `axor = int(axor, 2) ^ tmp`.**
