Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is now 1 plus the previous value of `cnt[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 1`, `lb` is greater than 0, and if `bit[j]` is '1', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
