The code `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` increments the value at the index `lb - 1 - j` of the list `cnt`. The variable `j` is defined as `lb - 2`, so the index being affected is `lb - 1 - (lb - 2)`, which simplifies to `1`. Therefore, `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1.

The previous state indicates that `cnt[0]` is 1, and all other indices (including `cnt[1]`) are initialized to 0. Thus, after executing the code, `cnt[1]` will become 1.

The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt` is a list of size `mxlba + 5` initialized to all 0s except `cnt[0]` which is now 1 and `cnt[1]` is now 1, `i` is 0, `bit` is a binary representation of a non-zero integer such that `lb` is at least 1, and `j` is `lb - 2`.**
