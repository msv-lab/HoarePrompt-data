The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation which is greater than 0; `ans` is 1; the `i`-th element of `axor` is '1'; `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1 and now is greater than or equal to 0; and `la - i - 1` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
