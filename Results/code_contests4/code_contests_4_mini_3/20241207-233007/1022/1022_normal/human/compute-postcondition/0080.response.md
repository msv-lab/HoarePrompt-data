The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is -1. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0); `ans` is 0**
