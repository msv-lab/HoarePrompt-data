Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0); if `axor[i]` is '1', and if `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, then -1 is printed before exiting; otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1 (and remains greater than or equal to 0); if `la - i - 1` equals 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2); `axor` is updated as `axor = int(axor, 2) ^ tmp`, reflecting its previous integer value in binary representation. If `axor[i]` is not '1', no changes are made to `cnt`, `ans`, or `axor`.***
