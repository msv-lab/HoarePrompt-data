The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program exits, but the execution of the code stops at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0); `ans` is 0; the `i`-th element of `axor` is '1'; and `cnt[i]` is equal to 0; and the value -1 is printed before exiting.
