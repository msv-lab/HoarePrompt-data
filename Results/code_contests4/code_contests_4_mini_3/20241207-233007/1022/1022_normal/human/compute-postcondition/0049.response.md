Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is incremented by the number of '1's found in the binary representation of `a[1]`, `cnt[1]` is incremented for the first '1' found to the left of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[2]` is incremented for the second '1' found to the left of `cnt[1]`, and so on, up to `cnt[lb - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is `lb - 1`, `lb` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `bit[j]` is '1'.***
