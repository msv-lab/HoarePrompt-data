The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. After execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 1; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0).

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 1; `la` is the length of `axor` in binary representation (which is greater than 0)**
