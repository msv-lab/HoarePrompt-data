The line `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` modifies the list `cnt` at the index calculated by `lb - 1 - j`. Here, `j` is `lb - 1`, which means the index is `lb - 1 - (lb - 1)`, resulting in an index of `0`. Therefore, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt` has been modified such that `cnt[0]` is now 1 + previous value of `cnt[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 1`, `lb` is greater than 0, and the value of `bit[j]` is '1'.**
