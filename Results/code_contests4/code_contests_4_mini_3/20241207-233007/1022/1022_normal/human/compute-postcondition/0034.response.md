The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is now 1 + previous value of `cnt[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 1`, `lb` is greater than 0, and the value of `bit[j]` is '1' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
