Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is incremented by the number of '1's found in the binary representation of `a[1]`, `cnt[1]` is incremented by the count of the first '1' found to the left of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[2]` is incremented by the count of the second '1' found to the left of `cnt[1]`, and so on, up to `cnt[lb - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is set to -1, and `lb` is the length of `bit`. If there are any '1's in the binary representation of `a[i]`, the first '1' encountered will cause `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` to be incremented by 1, and the loop will terminate early. If no '1's are found, then `cnt` remains unchanged for that context.**
