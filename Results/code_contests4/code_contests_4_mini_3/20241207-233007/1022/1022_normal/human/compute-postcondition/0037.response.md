The code `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` increments the value at the index `lb - 1 - j` of the `cnt` array by 1. The previous value of `cnt[0]` is now `1 + previous value of cnt[0]`, and `j` is `lb - 2`. Thus, the index `lb - 1 - j` can be simplified to `1`, since `lb - 1 - (lb - 2) = 1`.

This means that the value of `cnt[1]` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is now 1 plus the previous value of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 2`, and `lb` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `mxlba` is either 0 or a positive integer, `cnt[0]` is now 1 plus the previous value of `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `lb - 2`, and `lb` is greater than or equal to 2.**
