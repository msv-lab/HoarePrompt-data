The variable `mxlba` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from user input; `mxlba` is 0.
