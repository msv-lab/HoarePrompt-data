Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is the total number of integers processed; `i` is 2; `la` is greater than 1; if `la - i - 1` equals 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1, `cnt[2]` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
