The function accepts a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and a list of integers a_i (2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile i from 1 to N). It calculates the maximum length of the binary representations of the integers in the list, counts the occurrences of '1's at each bit position across these representations, and computes the bitwise XOR of all integers. If the XOR result is 0, it outputs 0. If not, it determines the number of significant '1's in the XOR result that can be matched with available counts from the bit positions, returning this count. If any significant '1' in the XOR result cannot be matched, it outputs -1. The function does not handle cases where N is 0, which should ideally not occur given the constraints.
