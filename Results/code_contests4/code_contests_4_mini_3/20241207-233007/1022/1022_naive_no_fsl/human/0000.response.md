Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of stones the cheater will eat in all edge cases. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2
2
3
```

In this case, both players start with a configuration where the cheetah could potentially win. The cheater should be able to eat one stone from one of the piles (to ensure a winning state). However, the program would incorrectly evaluate this scenario and potentially produce an incorrect output such as `-1` or a number of stones that does not minimize the stones eaten.

Additionally, if we input the case where all piles have the same number of stones, e.g., `3` piles of `100`, the output is `-1` as per the program's logic. However, in scenarios where the cheater can eat one stone from each pile (leaving `99` stones in each pile), the cheater would still have a winning strategy. Thus, the output should not be `-1` in this case, indicating a flaw in the logic.

Overall, the program does not handle various scenarios correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
