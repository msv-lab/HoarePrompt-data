You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Hooray! Polycarp turned n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his n birthdays: from the 1-th to the n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are beautiful.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — how many years Polycarp has turned.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.

Example

Input


6
18
1
9
100500
33
1000000000


Output


10
1
9
45
12
81

Note

In the first test case of the example beautiful years are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) represents the number of years Polycarp has turned, and the length of s is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representation of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) that is provided as input for multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer read from input, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) for each test case.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line into separate values and converting them to integers, where each integer corresponds to a positive integer n that satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the input value read from the standard input, which is a positive integer 'n' such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained from splitting the input read from the standard input

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of integers, where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) represents the number of years Polycarp has turned, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the length of args.
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of integers representing the number of years Polycarp has turned. If `debug` is true, the output is a string representation of the integers in `args` joined by spaces. If `debug` is false, there is no output specified.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: X is a positive integer, representing the number of years Polycarp has turned, with 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9.
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns 0 since (maxX - minX - 2) equals -2, leading to max(0, -2 * 2) which is max(0, -4) = 0


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
