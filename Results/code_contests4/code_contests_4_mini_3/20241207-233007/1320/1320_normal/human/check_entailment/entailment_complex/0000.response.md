Correctness: **False**

The code does not implement the logic required to count the "beautiful" years as defined in the problem statement. 

### Issues identified:

1. **Missing Logic to Count Beautiful Numbers**: The problem requires calculating the number of beautiful years (numbers that consist of only one digit repeated). However, none of the provided functions implement this logic. The code does not process the input values to count how many beautiful numbers exist up to `n`.

2. **Functionality of Provided Functions**: 
   - **func_1**, **func_2**, **func_3**, **func_4**, **func_5**, **func_6**, **func_7**: These functions primarily handle input and output operations but do not perform any calculations related to the problem. They simply read or write data without processing it to determine the count of beautiful numbers.
   - **func_8**: This function is entirely incorrect as it assumes `X` is a collection of numbers rather than a single integer, leading to a constant output of `0`, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

3. **No Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The problem states that there can be multiple test cases (up to 10,000), but there's no logic in the functions to handle and process each test case accordingly.

### Conclusion:
Since the code does not implement the necessary logic to count beautiful numbers and fails to properly handle the input/output as specified in the problem description, it is not correct. There is no example of the code working correctly since it does not even attempt the required computation.

Hence, the final verdict is that the program is incorrect.
