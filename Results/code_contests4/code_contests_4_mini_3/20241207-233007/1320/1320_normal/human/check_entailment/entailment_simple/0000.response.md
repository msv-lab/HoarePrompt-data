Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Definition of Beautiful Numbers**: The problem states that a positive integer is considered beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times (e.g., 1, 22, 333, 4444). The program, however, does not include any logic to count or identify these beautiful numbers.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program appears to have several functions (func_1 to func_8) that are either placeholders or incorrectly defined. None of these functions contain the necessary logic to compute the count of beautiful numbers between 1 and n for the given test cases.

3. **Output Specification**: The problem requires the program to output the count of beautiful years for each test case in order, yet the functions provided do not perform any such counting or outputting of the results based on the input values of n.

For example, for an input of `n = 18`, the expected output is `10`, which represents the beautiful numbers from 1 to 18 (1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 11). However, the program does not compute this at all, returning incorrect or no output.

4. **Missing Core Logic**: Key logic to evaluate the beautiful numbers is absent in the program. The functions provided seem to handle input and output but do not implement the logic required to determine the count of beautiful years.

Overall, the program lacks the fundamental implementation to solve the problem as described. Hence, it does not meet the requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
