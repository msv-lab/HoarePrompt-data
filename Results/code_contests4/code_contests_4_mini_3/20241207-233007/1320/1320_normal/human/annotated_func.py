#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) represents the number of years Polycarp has turned, and the length of s is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `s`, representing the number of years Polycarp has turned, and outputs the string representation of this list to standard output. It does not return any value or process the content of the list in any way.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representation of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) that is provided as input for multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` that represents a positive integer and writes this string to standard output, followed by a newline character. It does not perform any validation on the input string nor does it handle any exceptions that may arise from the output operation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer read from input, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer from input, returning that integer. The integer is expected to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) for each test case. However, the function does not handle multiple test cases as suggested by the annotations, since it only reads and returns a single integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line into separate values and converting them to integers, where each integer corresponds to a positive integer n that satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object that produces integers derived from splitting the input line into separate values. Each integer corresponds to a positive integer `n`, adhering to the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since the function does not explicitly handle any error cases or invalid inputs, it assumes that the input will always meet the specified criteria.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the input value read from the standard input, which is a positive integer 'n' such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` from standard input and returns it, ensuring that `n` is within the range of 1 to 10^9. There are no checks for input validation, so if the input is outside this range, the function may not handle it correctly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained from splitting the input read from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, and returns a list of these substrings as strings. It does not accept any parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of integers, where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) represents the number of years Polycarp has turned, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the length of args.
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of integers representing the number of years Polycarp has turned. If `debug` is true, the output is a string representation of the integers in `args` joined by spaces. If `debug` is false, there is no output specified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable `args`, which is expected to be a tuple of integers representing the number of years Polycarp has turned. The function checks if debugging is enabled and, if so, prints the integers in `args` as a space-separated string. However, the function does not return any results or perform any further processing on the integers in `args`, meaning it does not fulfill the stated purpose of processing the years or providing results based on them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: X is a positive integer, representing the number of years Polycarp has turned, with 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9.
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns 0 since (maxX - minX - 2) equals -2, leading to max(0, -2 * 2) which is max(0, -4) = 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer X and incorrectly attempts to determine a minimum and maximum value from it, which does not make sense since X is a single integer. As a result, the function will always return 0, since the expression (max(X) - min(X) - 2) will evaluate to -2, leading to max(0, -4). The implementation suggests a misunderstanding of the input type, as it tries to treat X as a collection of values rather than a single integer.
