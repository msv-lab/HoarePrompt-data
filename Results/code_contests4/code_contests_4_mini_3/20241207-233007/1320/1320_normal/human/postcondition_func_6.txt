The function accepts a variable `args`, which is expected to be a tuple of integers representing the number of years Polycarp has turned. The function checks if debugging is enabled and, if so, prints the integers in `args` as a space-separated string. However, the function does not return any results or perform any further processing on the integers in `args`, meaning it does not fulfill the stated purpose of processing the years or providing results based on them.
