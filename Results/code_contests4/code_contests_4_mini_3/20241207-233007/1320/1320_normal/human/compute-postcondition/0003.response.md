The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `X`. `X` is a positive integer representing the number of years Polycarp has turned, with the constraint that 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the program returns 0 since the calculation leads to a negative value, resulting in a final output of 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a positive integer `X` and return 0 based on the specified calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer X and returns 0 based on the calculations performed.**
