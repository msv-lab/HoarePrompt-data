The code assigns `minX` the value of `min(X)`. Since `X` is a positive integer, the `min` function applied to a single integer returns that integer itself. Therefore, `minX` will be equal to `X`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`X` is a positive integer, `minX` is equal to `X`**
