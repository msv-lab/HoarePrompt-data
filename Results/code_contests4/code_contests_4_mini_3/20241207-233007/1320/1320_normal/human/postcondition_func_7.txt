The function accepts a positive integer X and incorrectly attempts to determine a minimum and maximum value from it, which does not make sense since X is a single integer. As a result, the function will always return 0, since the expression (max(X) - min(X) - 2) will evaluate to -2, leading to max(0, -4). The implementation suggests a misunderstanding of the input type, as it tries to treat X as a collection of values rather than a single integer.
