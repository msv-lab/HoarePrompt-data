You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hooray! Polycarp turned n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his n birthdays: from the 1-th to the n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are beautiful.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — how many years Polycarp has turned.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.

Example

Input


6
18
1
9
100500
33
1000000000


Output

45
12
81

Note

In the first test case of the example beautiful years are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
