The function accepts an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It calculates the minimum sum of values from `a` corresponding to indices in `s` that match the characters of the word "hard". The function iterates through each character of "hard", determining ranges in `s` to count the ambiguity values from `a`, and returns the smallest sum found. If no valid characters match, it returns infinity as the minimum sum.
