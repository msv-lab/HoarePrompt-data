The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `en` is decremented by 1, `j` is -1, `cur` is decremented by 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
