The variable `en` is decremented by 1. Since the value of `en` is not provided in the initial state, I cannot determine its exact previous value. Thus, the output state will indicate that the decrement action took place without specifying the previous value of `en`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`en` is decremented by 1**
