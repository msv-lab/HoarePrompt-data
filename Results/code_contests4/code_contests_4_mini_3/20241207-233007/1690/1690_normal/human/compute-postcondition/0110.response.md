To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and the initial state of the variables.

1. The loop iterates from `j = n - 1` down to `j = 0`, decrementing `en` by 1 during each iteration.
2. The loop continues until `j` reaches -1 or until the `cur` variable equals `i`. If `cur` equals `i`, the loop breaks early.
3. The `cur` variable decrements only when the character at `s[j]` matches the character at `word[cur]`.

Since `j` starts at `n - 1` and decrements until it reaches -1, the maximum number of iterations is `n`. However, the loop may terminate early if `cur` equals `i` before all iterations are finished.

After the loop finishes executing, we can summarize the values of the variables:

- `j` will be -1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early; otherwise, `j` will be the last value before the break occurred.
- `cur` will be adjusted downwards only if characters match. The final value of `cur` will depend on how many matches were found before the loop terminated, or if it was equal to `i`.
- `en` will be decremented by the total number of iterations that were executed. If the loop executed all `n` iterations, `en` will be `initial_en - n`, where `initial_en` is its value before the loop.

Thus, the overall output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`j` is -1; `cur` is the final index reached in `word` after matches; `en` is equal to its initial value minus the number of iterations executed.**
