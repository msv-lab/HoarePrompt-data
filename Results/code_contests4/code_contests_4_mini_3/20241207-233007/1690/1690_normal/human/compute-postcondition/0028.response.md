`cur` is assigned the value of 3. The previous value of `cur` is not specified, but it is now set to 3. Other variables `n`, `j`, and `be` remain unaffected since they are not involved in this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is `n` or less; `cur` is 3; `be` is the number of iterations executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is `n` or less; `cur` is 3; `be` is the number of iterations executed.**
