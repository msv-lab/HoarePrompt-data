The value of `cur` is assigned the value 3. The other variables (`j`, `en`, `be`, `tem`, `s`, and `word`) remain unchanged. The previous value of `cur` is either equal to `i` or less than `i`, depending on matches found. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, `s` is unchanged, and `word` is unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, `s` is unchanged, and `word` is unchanged.**
