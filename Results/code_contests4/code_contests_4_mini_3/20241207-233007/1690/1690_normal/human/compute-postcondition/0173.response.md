The value of `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`, where `j` is equal to `n`. The specific value of `a[j]` is unknown, but since `n` is greater than 0, `j` is valid. The previous values of `be` and `en` do not affect the computation. After execution, the state of `tem` will reflect this update. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n`, `be` is greater than `en` (which is 0), `n` is greater than 0, and `tem` is increased by `a[j]`.

Output State: **`j` is `n`, `be` is greater than `en` (which is 0), `n` is greater than 0, and `tem` is increased by `a[j]`**
