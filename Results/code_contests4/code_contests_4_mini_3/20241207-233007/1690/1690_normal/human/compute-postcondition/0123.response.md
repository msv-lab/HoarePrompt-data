According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which ranges from 0 to 3 for a total of 4 iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4. 

Since the loop is set to terminate after 4 iterations, there will be no further condition related to `s`, `word`, `tem`, or `ans` that affects whether the loop continues; the loop's execution depends solely on the value of `i`.

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and will be incremented to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 4.

State: **`j` is equal to `en - 1`, `en` is greater than or equal to `be`, `s` and `word` are sequences, `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` from `be` to `en - 1` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, for the loop to execute a fifth time `i` must be equal to 4.**
