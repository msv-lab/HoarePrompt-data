The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The value of `j` is `n`, and for the loop to execute a next time, `n` must be greater than itself, which is not possible. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cur` is increased by 1 while `j` remains `n`. 

Output State: **`j` is `n`; `cur` is increased by 1**
