According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, starting with `j` initialized to 0 on the first iteration. The value of `n` is already defined to be within the range of 1 to 10^5, so it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `j` is indicated to be either `en - 1` or less than `be`, but since `en` is equal to `n`, we can infer that `j` will start at 0 for the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
- `n` is within the valid range (already guaranteed by the initial state).
- `j` is initialized to 0 for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
