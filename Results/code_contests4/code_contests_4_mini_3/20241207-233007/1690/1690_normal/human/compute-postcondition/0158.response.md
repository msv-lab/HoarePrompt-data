According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, making `j` equal to `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `j` will still be non-negative, allowing the loop to execute again.

State: **`j` is `n - 2`, `en` is `n - 1`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 0**
