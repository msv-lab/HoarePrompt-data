The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is not specified, but it is stated that `cur` is not equal to `i`. The values of `n`, `j`, and the elements of `s` and `word` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1 and is now equal to its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1**
