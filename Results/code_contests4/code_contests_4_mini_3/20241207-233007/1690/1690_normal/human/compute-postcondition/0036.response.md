Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 1`, and `cur` is 3. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or statement. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to 2, `be` remains 0, and if the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, the condition is satisfied, with further actions depending on subsequent program logic.***
