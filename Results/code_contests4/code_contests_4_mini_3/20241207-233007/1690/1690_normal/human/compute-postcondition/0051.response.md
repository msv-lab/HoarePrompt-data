According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `be` and `en`. For the loop to execute, `be` must be less than `en`. Since `j` is initialized to `-1` if the loop executed for all iterations or to the last index checked if the loop broke early, it is necessary to ensure that `be` is set correctly within the valid range of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
1. `be` should be less than `en` (which means `en` must be greater than `be`).
2. The initial value of `j` should be set to `be`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is set to `be`, for the loop to execute `be` is less than `en`**
