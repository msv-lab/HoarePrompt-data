`cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 3, so after execution, `cur` will be 2. The values of `n`, `j`, and `en` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is 2, `en` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is 2, `en` is decreased by 1**
