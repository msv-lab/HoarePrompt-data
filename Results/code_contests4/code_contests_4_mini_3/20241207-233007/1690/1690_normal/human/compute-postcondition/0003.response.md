According to the code, the loop will execute a fixed number of times, specifically 4 times, regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `s`, `a`, and `ans`. The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to 3 in successive iterations.

Since the loop does not depend on `n` or any other condition to execute, the only states that will be relevant at the start of the loop are the initialization of `i` and the loop's execution count. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0**
