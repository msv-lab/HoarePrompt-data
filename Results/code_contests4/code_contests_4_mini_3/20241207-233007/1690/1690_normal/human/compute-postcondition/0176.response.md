The value of `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The variable `j` has the value of `n + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `n + 1` must be less than `en`. However, since the value of `a[j]` is not specified, we cannot determine the specific change to `tem`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n + 1`, `tem` is increased by `a[j]` where `j` must be less than `en`.

Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `tem` is increased by `a[j]` where `j` must be less than `en.**
