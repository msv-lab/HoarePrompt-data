`cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 3, so after execution, `cur` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `j`, `be`, `en`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is 2, `be` remains 0, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.
