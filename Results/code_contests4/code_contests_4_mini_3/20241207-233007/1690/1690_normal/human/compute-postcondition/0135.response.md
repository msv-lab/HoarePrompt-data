According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `en - 1` (which is `n - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it equal to `n`. 

Therefore, after the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, and it will be incremented to `n` for the next iteration. Since `j` will now be equal to `n`, the loop will not execute again unless `n` changes.

State: **`j` is `n`, for the loop to execute a next time `n` must be greater than `n` (which is not possible).**
