According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, there are two scenarios to consider: if `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. 

After the last iteration, `j` is increased by 1, so it will become 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 2, `cur` remains unchanged, and `be` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
