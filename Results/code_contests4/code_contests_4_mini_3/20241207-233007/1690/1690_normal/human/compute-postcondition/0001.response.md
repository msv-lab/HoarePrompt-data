The code snippet defines a lambda function `rints` that reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list of integers. The previous state of `n`, `s`, and `a` remains unchanged, but now there is a new variable `rints` that can be used to read and convert input into a list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 998244353); `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line and converts it into a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 998244353); `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line and converts it into a list of integers.**
