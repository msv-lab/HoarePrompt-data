To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the following:

1. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. The loop continues until either `cur` equals `i`, or the end of the range is reached.
3. If the current character in `s` matches the character in `word` at index `cur`, then `cur` is incremented.
4. Regardless of whether the character matched or not, `be` is always incremented.

From the output states provided after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `cur` could increment if `s[0]` matches `word[0]`.
- After 2 iterations: `cur` may or may not have changed based on whether `s[1]` matched `word[1]`.
- After 3 iterations: `cur` will not be greater than `i` unless the matching conditions are satisfied.

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
- If `cur` equals `i`, it indicates that the loop broke early due to the break condition.
- If `cur` never reached `i`, it means the loop completed all iterations without a match or until the end of `s`.

The value of `be` will be equal to the number of iterations completed, which will be `n` unless the loop breaks earlier. 

If the loop executes completely, `cur` will be the number of matched characters from the start of `word` that were found in `s`, and `be` will equal `n`, indicating that all elements were processed.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is `n-1`; `cur` is the number of matched characters from `word` in `s` up to the point of the loop exit, `be` is equal to `n`.**
