Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. If `cur` is equal to `i`, `be` is increased by 1 and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, `cur` is increased by 1 and `be` is increased by 1, with the loop able to execute a second time only if `n` is greater than 2.***
