The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The initial state does not provide any information on `cur`, so we only know that `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. Since the increment of `cur` does not affect `n` or `j`, the output state reflects the change to `cur`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 1, `cur` is increased by 1**
