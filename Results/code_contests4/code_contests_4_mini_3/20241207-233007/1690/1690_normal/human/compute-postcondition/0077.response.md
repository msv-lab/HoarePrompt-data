The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is unknown as it is not provided in the initial state. The variables `n` and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is 1; `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is 1; `cur` is increased by 1**
