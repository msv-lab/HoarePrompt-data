Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is either `en - 1` if the loop executed for all iterations or `j` is less than `be` if the loop broke early; `cur` is either 3 or updated to a value between 0 and 3 inclusive, depending on matches with `word[cur]`; `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` values where `s[j]` matched `word[i]` for all valid `j` in the range from `be` to `en - 1; `be` remains unchanged; `en` is decreased by the total number of iterations executed; `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`.**
