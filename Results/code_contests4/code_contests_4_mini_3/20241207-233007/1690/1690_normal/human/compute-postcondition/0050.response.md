Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is -1 if the loop executed for all iterations or the last index checked if the loop broke early; `cur` is either 3 or updated to a value between 0 and 3 inclusive, depending on matches with `word[cur]`; `be` is the number of iterations executed, and `en` is decreased by the total number of iterations executed.**
