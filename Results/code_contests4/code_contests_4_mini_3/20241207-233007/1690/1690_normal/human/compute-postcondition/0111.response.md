According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `be` and `en`. The loop will execute if `be` is less than `en`, meaning that there is a range of values for `j` to iterate over. Before the loop starts, `j` is -1, which is the initial value and will be updated in the first iteration of the loop. The current value of `cur` and `en` being equal to its initial value minus the number of iterations executed is also relevant to ensure correct indexing.

For the loop to execute, `en` must be greater than `be`, and `j` will start at `be`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` should be `be` and ensure that `en` is greater than `be`.

State: **`j` is `be`, for the loop to execute `en` must be greater than `be`**
