According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop starts at `be` and goes up to `en - 1`, meaning the last value of `j` before the loop ends is `en - 1`. Since `j` is currently `be + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `en`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `be + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to `be + 2`. 

Thus, the conditions that must hold for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` must be less than `en`, so `be + 2` must be less than `en`.

In summary, to allow for one more iteration of the loop:
- `j` should be updated to `be + 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `be + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `s[j]` must equal `word[i]`, and `be + 2` must be less than `en`.**
