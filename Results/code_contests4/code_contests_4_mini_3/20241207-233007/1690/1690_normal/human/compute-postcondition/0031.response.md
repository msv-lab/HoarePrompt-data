The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` is 0, and `cur` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
