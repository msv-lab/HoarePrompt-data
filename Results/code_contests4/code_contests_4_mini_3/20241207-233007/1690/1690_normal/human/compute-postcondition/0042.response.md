Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 2`, and `cur` is 3. If `cur` equals `i`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if `cur` does not equal `i`, then `s[j]` is compared with `word[cur]`, and if they are equal, `cur` is updated to 2, with the condition that for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.***
