Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n-1`, if `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element of `s` at index `j` is equal to the element of `word` at index `cur`, then `cur` is decremented by 1.***
