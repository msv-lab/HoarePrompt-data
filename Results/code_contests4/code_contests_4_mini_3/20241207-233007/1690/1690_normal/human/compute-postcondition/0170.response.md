To analyze the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we must consider the loop's behavior based on its structure and the provided initial state.

The loop iterates `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`. In each iteration, if `cur` equals `i`, the loop breaks. If the character at `s[j]` matches the character at `word[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1. Regardless of the condition, `en` is decremented by 1 in every iteration.

Let's summarize the conditions:
- If `cur` reaches `i` during the iterations, the loop stops prematurely.
- If `cur` does not equal `i` after all iterations, it will continue until `j` reaches `-1`.

Based on the output states after the loop executes a few times:
1. After 1 iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, `en` is `n - 1`, `cur` remains unchanged unless the condition is met.
2. After 2 iterations, `j` is `n - 2`, `en` is `n - 2`, and so on.
3. After 3 iterations, `j`, `be`, and `tem` remain unchanged while `en` continues to decrement.

Assuming the loop runs to completion (i.e., it does not break due to `cur == i`), `j` will reach `-1`, `en` will be decremented to `0`, and `cur` will either remain unchanged or decrement based on the comparisons made.

Now, let's define the final output state after all iterations have completed:

- `j` is `-1` (loop has finished iterating).
- `en` is `0` (decremented through all iterations).
- `be` remains `n`.
- `tem` remains `0`.
- `cur` may or may not have decremented based on the character matches.
- `s` and `word` are unchanged.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`j` is -1, `en` is 0, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either `cur - k` (k being the number of matches) or unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 0.**
