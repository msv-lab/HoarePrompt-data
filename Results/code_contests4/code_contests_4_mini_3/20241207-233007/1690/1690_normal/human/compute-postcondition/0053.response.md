The variable `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The previous values of `j` and `a[j]` were known, as `j` is set to `be` and the conditions state that `be` is less than `en`. The value of `a[j]` is determined by the index `j`. However, the specific value of `a[j]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem` after the increment. Other variables, such as `n`, `be`, `en`, and `word`, are not affected directly by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is set to `be`, `be` is less than `en`, the character at index `j` of the string `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of the string `word`, and `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is set to `be`, `be` is less than `en`, the character at index `j` of the string `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of the string `word`, and `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`.**
