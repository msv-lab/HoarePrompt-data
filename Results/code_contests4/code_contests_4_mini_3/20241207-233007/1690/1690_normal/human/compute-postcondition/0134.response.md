Output State: **`j` is `en - 1`, `en` is `n`, `be` is 1, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0 when `cur` is equal to `i` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to 1, and if `s[j]` is equal to `word[0]`, the program recognizes this match; otherwise, no action is taken.**
