According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, which means the loop has reached its end condition. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, resulting in `j` being `n + 1`, but since the loop will not execute again in this case (as `j` is not less than `n`), we cannot adjust `j` to allow another iteration.

State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `cur` is unchanged, `be` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n + 1` (which is not possible)**.
