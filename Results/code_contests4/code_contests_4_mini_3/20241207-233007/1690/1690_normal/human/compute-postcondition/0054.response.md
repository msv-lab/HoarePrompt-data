Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is set to `be`, and `be` is less than `en`. If the character at index `j` of the string `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of the string `word`, then `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`. There is no change to `tem` if the characters are not equal.***
