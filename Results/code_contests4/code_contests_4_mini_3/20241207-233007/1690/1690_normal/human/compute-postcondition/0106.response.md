The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, so we cannot specify the new value of `cur`. The other variables `en` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `en` is decremented by 1, `j` is -1, and `cur` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`en` is decremented by 1, `j` is -1, and `cur` is decremented by 1.**
