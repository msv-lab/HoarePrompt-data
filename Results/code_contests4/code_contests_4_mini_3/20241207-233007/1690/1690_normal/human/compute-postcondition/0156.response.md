Postcondition: ***`j` is `n - 1`, `en` is `n`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i` and `cur` is updated to 2, the character at index `j` of `s` is compared with the character at index `cur` of `word`, and the condition is satisfied if they are equal.***
