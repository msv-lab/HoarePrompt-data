Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is either `en - 1` or less than `be`; `cur` is either 3 or updated to a value between 0 and 3 inclusive; `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` values where `s[j]` matched `word[i]` for all valid `j`; `be` remains unchanged; `en` is `n`; `tem` is 0.**
