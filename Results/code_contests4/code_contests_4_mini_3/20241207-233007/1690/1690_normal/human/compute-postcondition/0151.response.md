The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 1`, `en` is `n`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, and `cur` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
