`cur` is assigned the value `3`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `j`, and `be`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is `n-1`; `cur` is 3; `be` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is `n-1`; `cur` is 3; `be` is equal to `n`**
