The variable `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous state of `cur` is unknown, but it's affected directly by this operation. The values of `en` and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `en` is decremented by 1, `j` is at least 0, and `j` will be `n - 2`; `cur` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`en` is decremented by 1, `j` is at least 0, `j` will be `n - 2`; `cur` is decremented by 1.**
