The variable `en` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `en` is `n - 1`, so after execution, `en` becomes `n - 2`. The values of other variables (`j`, `be`, `tem`, `s`, `word`, `cur`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 2`, `en` is `n - 2`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n - 2`, `en` is `n - 2`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged**
