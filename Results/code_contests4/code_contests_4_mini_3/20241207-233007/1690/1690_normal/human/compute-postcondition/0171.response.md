According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `be` and `en`. The loop will execute when `be` is less than `en`. Given that `be` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `en` (which is 0) for the loop to execute. Additionally, we need to adjust `j` to the starting value of `be`, which is `n`.

State: **`j` is `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `be` is greater than `en` (which is 0), and `n` is greater than 0**
