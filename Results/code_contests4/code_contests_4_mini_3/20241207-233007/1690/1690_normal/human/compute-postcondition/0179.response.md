The variable `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. Since `j` is `n + 2`, the specific value of `a[j]` will depend on the contents of the array `a` at that index. However, since we do not have the values of `n`, `j`, or `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem` after this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment operation based on the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`tem` is increased by `a[j]`, where `j` is `n + 2`**
