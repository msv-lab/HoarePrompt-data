The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is 3, `en` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
