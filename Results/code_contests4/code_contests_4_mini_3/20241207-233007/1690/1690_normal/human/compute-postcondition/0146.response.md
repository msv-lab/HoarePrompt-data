The value of `be` is incremented by 1, which means that its previous value is increased by 1. The other variables `j`, `cur`, and `n` remain unchanged, but we note that `be` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n + 1`, `cur` is unchanged, `be` is increased by 1, and `n` cannot be greater than `n + 1`.

Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `cur` is unchanged, `be` is increased by 1, and `n` cannot be greater than `n + 1.**
