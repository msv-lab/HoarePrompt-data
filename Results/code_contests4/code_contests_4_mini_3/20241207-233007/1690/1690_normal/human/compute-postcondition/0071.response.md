The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is not specified, but it is known that `cur` is not equal to `i`. The other variables `n`, `j`, and the characters at the specified indices are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `cur` is incremented by 1, and the character at index `j` of string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of string `word`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `cur` is incremented by 1, and the character at index `j` of string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of string `word.**
