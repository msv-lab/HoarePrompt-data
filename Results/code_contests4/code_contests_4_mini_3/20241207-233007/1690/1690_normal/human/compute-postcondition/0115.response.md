According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `be` and `en`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `be`, and `en` is greater than `be`, meaning the loop can execute again. 

Since `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, the new value of `j` will be `be + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be `be + 1`, and it must still be less than `en`.

State: **`j` is `be + 1`, `en` is greater than `be + 1`, `s` and `word` are sequences.**
