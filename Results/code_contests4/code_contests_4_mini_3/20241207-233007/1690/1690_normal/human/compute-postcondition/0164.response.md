According to the code, the loop executes while `j` is in the range from `n - 1` down to `0`. The current state shows that at the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will be `n - 3`. 

Additionally, since the loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to be able to execute again. 

So, the updated state will reflect that `j` is now `n - 3`, while other variables remain unchanged. 

State: **`j` is `n - 3`, `en` is `n - 2`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
