`cur` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0.
