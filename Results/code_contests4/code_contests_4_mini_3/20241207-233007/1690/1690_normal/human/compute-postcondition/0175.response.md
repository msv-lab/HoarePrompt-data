According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, `be` is greater than `en`, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `j` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n + 1` must be less than `en`.

State: **`j` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again `n + 1` must be less than `en`**
