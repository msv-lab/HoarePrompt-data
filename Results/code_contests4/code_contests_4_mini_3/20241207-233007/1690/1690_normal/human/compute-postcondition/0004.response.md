The variables `be`, `en`, and `tem` are assigned the values 0, `n`, and 0, respectively. The variable `n` retains its original integer value within the specified range (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5). The other variables (`s`, `a`, `ans`, `word`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0**
