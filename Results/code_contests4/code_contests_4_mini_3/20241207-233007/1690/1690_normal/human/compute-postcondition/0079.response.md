Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 1. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is increased by 1; if `s[j]` is not equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` remains unchanged.***
