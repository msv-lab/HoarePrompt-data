According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `0`, which means the loop can potentially execute again if `j` is still greater than or equal to `0`. 

Since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, after the last iteration, `j` will be decreased by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be `-1`, which means it cannot execute again. However, since `j` was at least `0`, we can assume that it was `0` before decrementing, making it `-1` after decrementing.

Additionally, thereâ€™s no specification about how `cur` and `en` would affect the loop continuation aside from their current values. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next valid condition for `j`, which would be `j` being `-1` and `cur` and `en` remaining unchanged.

State: **`en` is decremented by 1, `j` is -1, `cur` is decremented by 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`**
