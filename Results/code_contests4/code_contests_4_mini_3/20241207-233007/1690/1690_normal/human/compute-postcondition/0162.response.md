Postcondition: ***`j` is `n - 2`, `en` is `n - 1`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged. If `cur` equals `i`, the most internal loop is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` is set to 2, and the loop continues executing as long as `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` and `n` is greater than 0.***
