According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, which is guaranteed by the given condition (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5). The loop initializes `j` to `n - 1` and decrements it until it reaches -1. Given that `j` is stated to be `n` or less, its initial value before the first iteration of the loop will be `n - 1`. 

Since `cur` is set to 3 and `be` is the number of iterations executed, which starts at 0 before the loop begins, we can conclude that:

- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.
- The initial value of `j` will be `n - 1` which is valid because `j` must start from `n - 1` and go down to -1.

Thus, the state must indicate that `j` starts at `n - 1` before the loop executes. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `n - 1`**
