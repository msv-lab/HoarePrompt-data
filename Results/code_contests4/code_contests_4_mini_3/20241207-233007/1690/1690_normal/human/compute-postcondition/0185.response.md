The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 998244353\), corresponding to the ambiguity associated with the i-th character in the string `s`.

The function processes these inputs and produces an output, but the exact nature of the output is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, I can describe the parameters and the constraints but not the specific return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where each integer in `a` represents the ambiguity associated with the characters in `s`.**
