The variable `en` is decremented by 1, but there is no information provided about the initial value of `en`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `cur`, `be`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` remains 0, and `en` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` remains 0, and `en` is decreased by 1.**
