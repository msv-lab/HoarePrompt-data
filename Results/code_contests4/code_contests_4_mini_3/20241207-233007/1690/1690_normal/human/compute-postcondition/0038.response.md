According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` will be `n - 2`. 

Also, the loop will continue to run until `j` reaches -1. Since `cur` is set to 3, `be` remains 0, and `en` has been decreased by 1, we are not making any changes to those variables for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is 3, `be` remains 0, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
