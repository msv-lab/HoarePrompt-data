The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 3, so after execution, `cur` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `j`, `be`, `i`, `s`, and `word`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 2, `be` is 0, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 2, `be` is 0, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`.**
