`cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 2, `cur` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 2, `cur` is increased by 1**
