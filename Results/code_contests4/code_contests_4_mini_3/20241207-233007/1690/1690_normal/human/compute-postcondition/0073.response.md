Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i` and the character at index `j` of string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of string `word`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.***
