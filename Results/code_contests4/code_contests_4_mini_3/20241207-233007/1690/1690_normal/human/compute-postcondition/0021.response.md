According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. After the current iteration, `j` will be increased by 1, making it 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
