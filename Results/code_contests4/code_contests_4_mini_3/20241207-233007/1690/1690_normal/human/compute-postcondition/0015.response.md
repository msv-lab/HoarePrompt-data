According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `cur` has been incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1. The variable `n` can be any integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). However, since `j` is now 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
