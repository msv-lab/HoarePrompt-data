According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is set to `be`, and `be` is less than `en`, which means the loop can execute again. Since the loop starts with `j` equal to `be`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will increase by 1 after the current iteration. 

Thus, `j` will be set to `be + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `en`, so we need `be + 1` to be less than `en`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `be + 1`, and `be` is less than `en` for the loop to execute again.**
