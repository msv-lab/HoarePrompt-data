According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to the range defined by `n`. The loop is designed to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is 3, and `en` has been decreased by 1. 

Since `j` is initially set to `n - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, so that `j` can be 0 (the minimum value that it can take).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is 3, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
