According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the range defined by `be` and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented, which means it will be `n + 2`. Therefore, `j` must be less than `en` for the loop to execute again.

To summarize:
- `j` is currently `n + 1`.
- In the next iteration, `j` will be `n + 2`.
- For the loop to execute again, `n + 2` must be less than `en`.

State: **`j` is `n + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `en`**
