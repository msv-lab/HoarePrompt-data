According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be incremented to 1, and `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to allow this increment.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
