The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 3`, `en` is `n - 2`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged, and we break out of the loop. 

Output State: **`j` is `n - 3`, `en` is `n - 2`, `be` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `s` is unchanged, `word` is unchanged, and we break out of the loop.**
