According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, the loop will execute at least once because `n` is always at least 1. The loop variable `j` will start from 0 and will increment until it reaches `n - 1` (inclusive). Therefore, the state values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is 0**
