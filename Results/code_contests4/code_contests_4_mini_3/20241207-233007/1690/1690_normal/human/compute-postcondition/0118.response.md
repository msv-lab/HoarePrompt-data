According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `be + 1`, and since `en` is greater than `be + 1`, it indicates that there is still room for `j` to increase. 

In this case, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will now be `be + 2`. The loop will be able to execute again under the condition that `j` (which would be `be + 2`) is still less than `en`.

State: **`j` is `be + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `en` must be greater than `be + 2`**
