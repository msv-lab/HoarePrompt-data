According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `en - 1`, which is `n - 1`, and will iterate from `0` to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. 

Given the states, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, and `tem` is currently calculated as the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` from `be` to `en - 1` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`. However, the initial state of `tem` being 0 does not affect whether the loop executes.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, since `j` is initialized to `en - 1`, which is `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is at least 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`j` is `en - 1`, `en` is `n`, `be` is 0, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
