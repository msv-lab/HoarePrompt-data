To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the conditions and how the variables interact throughout the loop. 

The loop iterates through the range of `n` and checks if the character in the string `s` at index `j` matches the character in the string `word` at index `cur`. The loop can terminate early if `cur` equals `i`. The variable `be` counts the number of iterations regardless of whether the characters match.

1. If `cur` reaches the length of the string `word` (which is 4 since `word` is 'hard'), the loop will stop matching further characters since `cur` will be equal to `i`. In this case, `be` will equal the number of characters checked in `s` until that point.

2. If the loop iterates through all `n` characters in `s` without `cur` reaching `i`, then `cur` will be less than `i` because the condition to break the loop (i.e., `cur == i`) has not been satisfied.

In summary, at the end of the loop:
- `cur` will be the number of characters from `word` that matched the corresponding characters in `s` up to `n` or the length of `word`.
- `be` will be the total number of iterations executed, which will be equal to `n` if `cur` has never reached `i` or equal to the number of checked characters if `cur` reaches `i` before `j` runs from 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is `n` or less; `cur` is the number of matched characters from `word`, `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is equal to `n` if `cur` is less than `i`, otherwise it will be the index at which the loop breaks).**
