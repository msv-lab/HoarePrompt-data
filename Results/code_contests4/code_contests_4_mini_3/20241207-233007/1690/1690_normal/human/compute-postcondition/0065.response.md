The variable `cur` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `cur` could be either `3` or updated to a value between `0` and `3`, but since it is explicitly set to `0`, the final value of `cur` is now `0`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `tem`, `be`, `en`, and the array `a` or `s`) remain unchanged and unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `j` is either `en - 1` or less than `be`; `cur` is 0; `tem` is 0; `be` remains unchanged; `en` is `n`.
