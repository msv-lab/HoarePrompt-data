According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`. The loop will iterate from `n-1` down to `0`, inclusive. Given that `n` is an integer in the range of 1 to 10^5, it guarantees that `n-1` is at least 0, meaning the loop can execute at least once.

Before the loop starts, `j` is set to `n-1`, which is the starting point of the loop, and `cur` and `be` are defined but do not directly impact the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to execute, `n` should remain within its defined range, and `j` will correctly start at `n-1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `j` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `n-1`**
