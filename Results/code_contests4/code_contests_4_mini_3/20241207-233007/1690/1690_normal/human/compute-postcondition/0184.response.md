Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `ans` is the minimum sum of `a[j]` values for all valid indices `j` where `s[j]` matches `word[i]` over all iterations of `i`; `be` is the starting index for the inner forward loop; `en` is the final index for the inner backward loop; `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` values within the range from `be` to `en - 1` for each respective `i`; and the value of `ans` is printed.**
