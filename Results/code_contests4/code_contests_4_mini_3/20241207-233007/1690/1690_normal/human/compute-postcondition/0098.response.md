According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which starts at `n - 1` and decrements with each iteration. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `en` has been decremented by 1, but we need to focus on the state related to the loop.

Since `j` starts at `n - 1`, and assuming it was decremented in the previous iteration, it must now be at least 0 for the loop to execute again. If the loop is to execute one more time, `j` will be decremented by 1, meaning it will now take the value of `j` equal to `n - 2` (if it was `n - 1` before).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be at least 0 before the next iteration.

State: **`en` is decremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be at least 0, and `j` will be `n - 2`.**
