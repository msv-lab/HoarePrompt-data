Postcondition: ***`j` is `n + 1`, `cur` is unchanged, and `be` is increased by 1. If `cur` equals `i`, we break out of the loop. Otherwise, `j` remains `n + 1`, `cur` is unchanged, `be` is increased by 1, and if `s[j]` equals `word[cur]`, then `cur` is increased by 1, and `be` is also increased by 1. However, it is impossible for `n` to be greater than `n + 1`.***
