To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the provided code and check if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program should read pairs of a word and a page number.
2. Each word can be associated with multiple page numbers.
3. A word should be printed in alphabetical order.
4. The page numbers for each word should be printed in ascending order.
5. The program should handle up to 100 pairs of word and page number inputs.

### Code Analysis:
- The program utilizes `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to create a dictionary where each word maps to a list of page numbers.
- For each line of input, it splits the line into a word and a page number and appends the page number (converted to an integer) to the list corresponding to that word.
- After processing the input, it sorts the words alphabetically and prints each word followed by the sorted list of its associated page numbers.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The program expects input from `stdin`, but if it receives an empty input or improperly formatted lines (e.g., missing page numbers), it may lead to errors. Specifically, if a line does not contain exactly two parts when split by space, it will raise a `ValueError`.
   
2. **Page Number Validation**: The program does not validate that the page numbers are less than or equal to 1000 as mentioned in the problem description. If a user inputs a page number greater than 1000, the program would accept it without any error, which violates the requirement.

3. **Word Length**: The program does not enforce the maximum length of the word (30 characters). If a user inputs a word longer than 30 characters, the program will still accept it, which is against the specifications.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified above, particularly the lack of input validation for both the word length and page number, the program does not adhere fully to the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as specified.

Correctness: **False**
