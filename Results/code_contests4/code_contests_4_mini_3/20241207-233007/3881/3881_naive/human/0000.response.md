To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem description:
- The program should read pairs of a word and a page number.
- Each word should be printed in alphabetical order along with a list of corresponding page numbers in ascending order.
- A word never appears on a page more than once.
- Constraints on input have been given regarding the maximum length of the word and the page number.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1():
    index = defaultdict(list)
    for line in stdin:
        (word, page) = line.split()
        index[word].append(int(page))
    for word in sorted(index):
        print(word)
        print(*sorted(index[word]))
    exit()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program expects input from `stdin`. However, it does not handle cases where the input may not be in the expected format (e.g., if a line does not contain exactly two elements or if the page number is not a valid integer). This could lead to a runtime error.
   
2. **Output Order**:
   - The program sorts the words alphabetically and sorts the page numbers for each word. This matches the problem requirement.

3. **Duplicate Pages**:
   - The problem states that a word never appears on a page more than once. The code does not enforce this in terms of input validation, which means if the input is incorrect (e.g., duplicates), the program will not alert the user and will simply append the page number to the list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle empty input or invalid input formats. If no valid input is provided, the program will not produce any output, which may not be the intended behavior. 

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle invalid or edge case inputs correctly. For example, if the input is:
```
style 12
even invalid_page
introduction 3
```
The line with "even invalid_page" will cause a `ValueError` when converting `invalid_page` to an integer, which the program does not account for. 

Given this analysis, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
