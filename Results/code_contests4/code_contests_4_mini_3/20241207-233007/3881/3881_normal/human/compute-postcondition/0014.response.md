According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `index` and its sorting. The loop iterates over the sorted words in `index`. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the first word in the sorted list of keys from the `index`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more word in the sorted list of keys. Since `word` is currently the first word, the next word will be the second word in the sorted list. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `word` is updated to the next word in the sorted order. If there are at least two unique words in `index`, the loop will be able to execute again with `word` set to the second word.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each `word` to a list of `page` numbers where the word appears, `word` is the second word in sorted(index)**
