According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lines to read from `stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `word` is the first part of the next split line, and `page` is the second part of the next split line. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `word` and `page` will be updated with the values from the next line read from `stdin`. Therefore, `index` will have `int(page)` appended to the list corresponding to `word`.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists; `word` is the first part of the next split line, `page` is the second part of the next split line; for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more line to read from stdin.**
