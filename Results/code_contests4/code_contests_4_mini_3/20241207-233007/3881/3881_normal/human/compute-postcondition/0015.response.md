The code `print(word)` outputs the current value of the variable `word`. The `word` is defined as the second word in the sorted `index`. Since the initial state indicates that `index` is a defaultdict of lists, we assume it contains multiple words, and thus the second word will have a specific value depending on the contents of `index`. The other variable, `index`, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each `word` to a list of `page` numbers where the word appears; `word` is the second word in sorted(index)**
