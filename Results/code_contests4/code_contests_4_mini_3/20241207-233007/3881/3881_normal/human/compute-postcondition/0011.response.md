According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `index`. The loop will iterate over the sorted keys of the `index`, which means that `index` must contain at least one word for the loop to execute. If `index` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. 

For the loop to be executed, `index` should not be empty and should contain at least one mapping of a `word` to a list of `page` numbers. Also, since the loop iterates over `sorted(index)`, the first `word` will be the smallest key in the `index`, and it will be the first element processed in the loop.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each `word` to a list of `page` numbers where the word appears, for the loop to execute `index` must not be empty and must have at least one mapping, `word` is the first word in sorted(index)**
