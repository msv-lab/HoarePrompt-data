The loop processes each line of input, splitting it into a `word` and a `page` number, and appends the integer value of `page` to a list associated with the `word` in the `index` defaultdict. After all iterations of the loop have executed, `index` will contain all words as keys, with each key mapping to a list of corresponding page numbers where the word appears.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., there are no lines in `stdin`), `index` will remain a defaultdict of lists that is empty.

Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each `word` to a list of `page` numbers where the word appears; if no lines were processed, `index` is empty.**
