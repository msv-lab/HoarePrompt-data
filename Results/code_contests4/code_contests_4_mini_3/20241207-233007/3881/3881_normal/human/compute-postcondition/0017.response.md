According to the code, the loop iterates over the words in the sorted version of the `index`. The variable `word` represents the current word being processed from the sorted list of words. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the second word in the sorted list. For the loop to execute one more time, the next `word` will be the third word in the sorted list of `index`. 

To adjust the state accordingly, we note that the sorted list must have at least three words for the loop to continue. Therefore, the state must reflect the current situation with the next `word` being the third in sorted order.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each `word` to a list of `page` numbers where the word appears; `word` is the third word in sorted(index), for the loop to execute one more time sorted(index) must have at least 3 words.**
