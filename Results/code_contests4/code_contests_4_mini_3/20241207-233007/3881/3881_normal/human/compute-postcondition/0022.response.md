The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output description, it processes pairs of strings (words) and integers (page numbers) where each word has at most 30 characters and the page number is an integer less than or equal to 1000. The total number of pairs is limited to 100, and each word can only appear once on the same page. The function likely performs some operations based on these constraints but does not return any specific values or outputs based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and works with pairs of words and page numbers, but does not return any specific output.**
