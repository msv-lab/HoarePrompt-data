The `index` is a defaultdict of lists, which means it automatically creates a new list for any new key. The `word` variable holds the first part of the split line, and `page` holds the second part as an integer after converting it. 

The code `index[word].append(int(page))` appends the integer value of `page` to the list associated with the key `word` in the `index` defaultdict. 

Since `index` is a defaultdict, if `word` does not already exist in `index`, a new list will be created for it. The existing values in the list will be preserved and the new integer from `page` will be added to this list.

Since the previous state does not provide specific values for `index`, `word`, or `page`, but indicates an update is occurring, the output state reflects the action taken.

Output State: **`index` is updated with `page` added to the list for `word`**
