The code prints the sorted list of page numbers associated with the `word` in the `index`. The `word` is defined as the third word in the sorted keys of the `index`. The initial state indicates that `index` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each `word` to a list of `page` numbers where the word appears. The output will be the page numbers for the specific `word`, printed in sorted order. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each `word` to a list of `page` numbers; `word` is the third word in sorted(index); the corresponding page numbers are printed in sorted order.

Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each `word` to a list of `page` numbers; `word` is the third word in sorted(index); the corresponding page numbers are printed in sorted order.**
