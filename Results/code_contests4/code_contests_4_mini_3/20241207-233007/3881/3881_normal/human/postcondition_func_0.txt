The function reads pairs of words and page numbers from input, storing them in a defaultdict that maps each word to a list of unique page numbers where the word appears. It then prints each word in sorted order followed by the sorted list of associated page numbers. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; it only outputs the results directly to the standard output. It assumes that the input consists of valid pairs of strings and integers, with words not exceeding 30 characters and page numbers being less than or equal to 1000.
