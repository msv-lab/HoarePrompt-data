Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it does so:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads pairs of words and page numbers from input. It assumes that the input consists of valid pairs, which align with the constraints provided in the problem statement (words with at most 30 characters and page numbers less than or equal to 1000).

2. **Data Structure**: The program uses a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module, which is appropriate for storing lists of page numbers for each word. This allows it to efficiently append page numbers to a list associated with each word.

3. **Unique Page Numbers**: The problem states that a word never appears on the same page more than once. The program doesn't explicitly check for duplicates when appending page numbers, but the problem description implicitly assumes that such duplicates won't occur in the input. Hence, the program adheres to this aspect.

4. **Sorting**: The program sorts the words alphabetically using `sorted(index)` and also sorts the associated page numbers with `sorted(index[word])`. This meets the requirement of printing the words in alphabetical order and their corresponding page numbers in ascending order.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints each word followed by its sorted list of page numbers, which matches the specified output format in the problem description.

6. **No Errors in Constraints**: The program does not violate any of the constraints provided (e.g., number of pairs, character limits on words, and page number limits).

Given all of the above, the program accurately fulfills the problem requirements and is thus correct.
