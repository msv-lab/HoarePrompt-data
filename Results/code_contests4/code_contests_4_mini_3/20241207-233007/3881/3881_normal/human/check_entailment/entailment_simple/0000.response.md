Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program conforms to the description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads pairs of a word and a page number from standard input. It correctly splits each line into a word and a page number, adhering to the input format specified.

2. **Data Structure**: It uses a `defaultdict` of lists to map each word to a list of page numbers. This is appropriate because it allows for multiple page numbers to be associated with a single word, as required by the problem description.

3. **Page Number Handling**: The program correctly converts page numbers from strings to integers and appends them to the list associated with each word. It adheres to the constraint that a word will not appear on the same page more than once, as it uses lists to gather page numbers without duplicates.

4. **Sorting**: The program prints the words in alphabetical order and the associated page numbers in ascending order. This is explicitly achieved through the use of `sorted()` when iterating through the keys of the dictionary and when printing the lists of page numbers.

5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the requirement of printing each word followed by its corresponding list of page numbers, each on a new line.

Overall, the program effectively satisfies all conditions laid out in the problem description, ensuring correct functionality for valid input cases as specified. Therefore, the correctness evaluation is True.
