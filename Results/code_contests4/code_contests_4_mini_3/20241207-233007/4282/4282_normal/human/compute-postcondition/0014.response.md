The last element of the list `f` is updated by appending the character `c` to it. Since `f` initially contains an empty string, `f[-1]` refers to that empty string. When `c` is appended, the last element of `f` will now contain the value of `c`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list containing the character `c` as the last element, and the previous value of `f` was a list with an empty string.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing the character `c` as the last element; previously, `f` was a list containing an empty string.**
