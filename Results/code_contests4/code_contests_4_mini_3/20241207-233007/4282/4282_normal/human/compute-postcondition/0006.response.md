Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing an empty string; if `n` is not an empty string, then `f` is updated to contain the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`. The sequence `s` has at least 1 element, and `c` is the first character from ''.join(s), which is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', or '('. If `n` is an empty string, no changes occur to `f`.***
