Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that starts with an empty string. If `c` is '(', `f` contains the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` and has at least two empty strings. If `c` is ')', an IndexError occurs due to accessing `f[-1]`, and `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('')`. For any other character `c` that is one of the operators '+', '-', '*', '/', `f` is updated to contain `c` as its last element. If `c` is not one of these characters, `n` is increased by the value of `c`.***
