Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that, if `c` is equal to '(', contains the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` and has at least two empty strings. If `c` is equal to ')', an IndexError occurs due to accessing `f[-1]`, and `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('')`. Otherwise, `f` is updated to contain the character `c` as the last element, and `f` was previously a list containing an empty string.***
