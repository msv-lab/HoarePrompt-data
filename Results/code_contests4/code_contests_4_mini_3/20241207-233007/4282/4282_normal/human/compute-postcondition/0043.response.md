Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that starts with an empty string. If `c` is equal to '(', `f` now contains an additional empty string. If `c` is equal to ')', then `f` remains unchanged as an empty list, `n` is an empty string, and an error occurs due to invalid evaluation. For other values of `c`, `f` is updated by adding `c` to `f[-1]`. In the else part, `n` is incremented by `c`, where `c` is an unspecified value.***
