Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing an empty string. If `c` is equal to ')', `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('')`, and an IndexError occurs due to attempting to access `f[-1]`. Otherwise, `f` is updated to contain the character `c` as the last element, and `f` was previously a list containing an empty string.***
