The value of `n` is incremented by `c`. However, the initial values of `n` and `c` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `n`. The state of `f` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list that starts with an empty string, `n` is incremented by `c` (where `c` is an unspecified value). 

Output State: **`f` is a list that starts with an empty string, `n` is incremented by `c` (where `c` is an unspecified value)**
