Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing the final processed string segments or results derived from the characters in `s`. If `n` is a non-empty string containing the last operand that was not processed before the loop ended, then `f[0]` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` to it. If `n` is an empty string, no changes are made to `f`.***
