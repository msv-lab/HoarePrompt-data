Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that starts with an empty string. If `c` is equal to '(', `f` now has an additional empty string appended to it, resulting in a list with two empty strings: ['', '']. If `c` is equal to ')', `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('10')`, and `f[-1]` is updated by adding `m` to it, provided `n` is not an empty string; if `n` is an empty string, no changes are made to `f`. If `c` is not equal to ')', then `f[-1]` is updated by adding `c` to it, again only modifying `f[-1]` if `n` is not an empty string; if `n` is an empty string, no changes are made to `f`.***
