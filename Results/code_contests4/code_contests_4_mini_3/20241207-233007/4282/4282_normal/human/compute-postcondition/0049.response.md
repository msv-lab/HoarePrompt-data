The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string that contains a number of `#define` constructions followed by an expression to check, formatted as `"#define name expression"`. The number of constructions `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= 100`, and each line can contain any number of spaces with a maximum length of 100 characters. After executing the function body, it returns the level of the evaluated expression represented by `f[0]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `s` containing `#define` constructions and an expression, and return the level of the evaluated expression. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string s containing #define constructions and an expression, returns the level of the evaluated expression represented by f[0].**
