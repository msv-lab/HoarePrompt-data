Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that starts with an empty string. If `c` is equal to '(', an additional empty string is appended to `f`, resulting in a list with two empty strings: ['', '']. If `c` is equal to ')', `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('10')`, and `f[-1]` is updated by adding `m` to it, provided `n` is not an empty string; if `n` is empty, no changes are made to `f`. If `c` is not equal to ')', `f[-1]` is updated by adding `c` to it, again only modifying `f[-1]` if `n` is not an empty string; if `n` is empty, no changes are made to `f`. If none of the conditions are met (i.e., `c` is not one of the specified operators), `n` is increased by `c`, and for the loop to execute again, there must be more characters in `s` to process.***
