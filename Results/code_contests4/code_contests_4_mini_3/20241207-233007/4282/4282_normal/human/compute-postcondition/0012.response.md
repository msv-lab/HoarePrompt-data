The code attempts to update the last element of the list `f` using the result of `m`, which is assigned the result of `func_1('')`. However, since `f` is an empty list, trying to access `f[-1]` will result in an "IndexError" because there are no elements in the list. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, and the execution results in an error. 

Output State: **`f` is an empty list; `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('')`, and an IndexError occurs due to attempting to access `f[-1]`.**
