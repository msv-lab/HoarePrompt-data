Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that starts with an empty string. If `c` is equal to ')', then `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('10')`, and `f[-1]` is updated by adding `m` to it. If `c` is not equal to ')', then `f[-1]` is updated by adding `c` to it. If `n` is not an empty string, `f[-1]` is modified in both cases; if `n` is an empty string, no changes are made to `f` in the case where `c` is ')'.***
