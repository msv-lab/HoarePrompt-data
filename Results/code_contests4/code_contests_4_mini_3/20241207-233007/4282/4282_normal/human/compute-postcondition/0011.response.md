Given the initial state:

- `f` is a list containing an empty string.
- `if n` is not an empty string, then `f` is updated to contain the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`.
- The sequence `s` has at least 1 element.
- `c` is the first character from ''.join(s), which is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', or '/'.
- The character `c` is not '(', and `c` is equal to ')'.

Now analyzing the code:

```
m = func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0'])
```

1. `f.pop()` removes the last element from `f`, which is an empty string `''`.
2. The expression `eval(f.pop()).level == '0'` evaluates the expression from the popped value. Since the popped value is an empty string, `eval('')` will raise a `SyntaxError`, but for the sake of this task, we will assume that it returns an object that has a `level` attribute.
3. The value of `10` is a string, and when accessed as `func_1('10'[False])`, it evaluates to `func_1('')` since `False` (the result of `eval(f.pop()).level == '0'` if we assume it evaluates to `False`) means taking the first character of the string `'10'`, which is an empty string.
4. `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('')`.

Since we don't have the actual implementation of `func_1`, we can't determine the value of `m`, but we can state that `m` is assigned a value based on the result of `func_1('')`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`f` is an empty list; `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('')`.**
