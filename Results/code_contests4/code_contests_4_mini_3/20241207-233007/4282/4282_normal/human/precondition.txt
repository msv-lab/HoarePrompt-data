n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 100, each #define construction has a name which is a string of case-sensitive Latin characters, and an expression which is a non-empty string containing digits, names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/. The final expression to check is also a non-empty string with the same restrictions.
