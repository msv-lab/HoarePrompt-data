s is a string that contains a number of #define constructions followed by an expression to check, where each construction is formatted as "#define name expression" and the expression is a valid arithmetic expression with variables, constants, and previously defined macros. The number of constructions n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 100. Each line can contain any number of spaces, and the length of any line does not exceed 100 characters.
