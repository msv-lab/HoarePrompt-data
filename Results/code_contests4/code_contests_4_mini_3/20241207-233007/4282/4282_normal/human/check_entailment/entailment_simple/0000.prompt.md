You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Most C/C++ programmers know about excellent opportunities that preprocessor #define directives give; but many know as well about the problems that can arise because of their careless use.

In this problem we consider the following model of #define constructions (also called macros). Each macro has its name and value. The generic syntax for declaring a macro is the following:

#define macro_name macro_value

After the macro has been declared, "macro_name" is replaced with "macro_value" each time it is met in the program (only the whole tokens can be replaced; i.e. "macro_name" is replaced only when it is surrounded by spaces or other non-alphabetic symbol). A "macro_value" within our model can only be an arithmetic expression consisting of variables, four arithmetic operations, brackets, and also the names of previously declared macros (in this case replacement is performed sequentially). The process of replacing macros with their values is called substitution.

One of the main problems arising while using macros — the situation when as a result of substitution we get an arithmetic expression with the changed order of calculation because of different priorities of the operations.

Let's consider the following example. Say, we declared such a #define construction:

#define sum x + y

and further in the program the expression "2 * sum" is calculated. After macro substitution is performed we get "2 * x + y", instead of intuitively expected "2 * (x + y)".

Let's call the situation "suspicious", if after the macro substitution the order of calculation changes, falling outside the bounds of some macro. Thus, your task is to find out by the given set of #define definitions and the given expression if this expression is suspicious or not.

Let's speak more formally. We should perform an ordinary macros substitution in the given expression. Moreover, we should perform a "safe" macros substitution in the expression, putting in brackets each macro value; after this, guided by arithmetic rules of brackets expansion, we can omit some of the brackets. If there exist a way to get an expression, absolutely coinciding with the expression that is the result of an ordinary substitution (character-by-character, but ignoring spaces), then this expression and the macros system are called correct, otherwise — suspicious.

Note that we consider the "/" operation as the usual mathematical division, not the integer division like in C/C++. That's why, for example, in the expression "a*(b/c)" we can omit brackets to get the expression "a*b/c".

Input

The first line contains the only number n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the amount of #define constructions in the given program.

Then there follow n lines, each of them contains just one #define construction. Each construction has the following syntax:

#define name expression

where

  * name — the macro name, 
  * expression — the expression with which the given macro will be replaced. An expression is a non-empty string, containing digits,names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets and operational signs +-*/. It is guaranteed that the expression (before and after macros substitution) is a correct arithmetic expression, having no unary operations. The expression contains only non-negative integers, not exceeding 109. 



All the names (#define constructions' names and names of their arguments) are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters. It is guaranteed that the name of any variable is different from any #define construction.

Then, the last line contains an expression that you are to check. This expression is non-empty and satisfies the same limitations as the expressions in #define constructions.

The input lines may contain any number of spaces anywhere, providing these spaces do not break the word "define" or the names of constructions and variables. In particular, there can be any number of spaces before and after the "#" symbol.

The length of any line from the input file does not exceed 100 characters.

Output

Output "OK", if the expression is correct according to the above given criterion, otherwise output "Suspicious".

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a string that contains multiple lines of input, where the first line is a non-negative integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of #define constructions, followed by n lines each containing a #define construction in the format "#define name expression", and a final line containing an expression to check, all while possibly containing any number of spaces.
def func_1(c):
    return 'macro("' + c + '")'
    #The program returns the string 'macro("' followed by the entire content of the string c, which includes the number of #define constructions, the #define lines, and the final expression, followed by '")'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that contains a number of #define constructions followed by an expression to check, where each construction is formatted as "#define name expression" and the expression is a valid arithmetic expression with variables, constants, and previously defined macros. The number of constructions n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 100. Each line can contain any number of spaces, and the length of any line does not exceed 100 characters.
def func_2(s):
    f, n = [''], ''
    for c in ''.join(s):
        if c in '+-*/()':
            if n != '':
                f[-1] += func_1(v.get(n, '1'))
                n = ''
            if c == '(':
                f.append('')
            elif c == ')':
                m = func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0'])
                f[-1] += m
            else:
                f[-1] += c
        else:
            n += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is a list containing the final processed string segments or results derived from the characters in `s`, `n` is an empty string if no operands were accumulated, or it contains the last operand if it was not processed before the loop ended. The list `f` may contain empty strings and/or operator characters as defined by the input characters processed.
    if (n != '') :
        f[0] += func_1(v.get(n, '1'))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is a list containing the final processed string segments or results derived from the characters in `s`. If `n` is a non-empty string containing the last operand that was not processed before the loop ended, then `f[0]` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` to it. If `n` is an empty string, no changes are made to `f`.
    return eval(f[0]).level
    #The program returns the level of the evaluated expression represented by f[0]


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
