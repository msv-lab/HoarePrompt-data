#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a string that contains multiple lines of input, where the first line is a non-negative integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of #define constructions, followed by n lines each containing a #define construction in the format "#define name expression", and a final line containing an expression to check, all while possibly containing any number of spaces.
def func_1(c):
    return 'macro("' + c + '")'
    #The program returns the string 'macro("' followed by the entire content of the string c, which includes the number of #define constructions, the #define lines, and the final expression, followed by '")'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `c`, which contains multiple lines of input formatted as a non-negative integer followed by `#define` constructions and an expression to check. It returns a new string that wraps the entire content of `c` within the format 'macro("...")', effectively enclosing the content within the 'macro' function call syntax.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that contains a number of #define constructions followed by an expression to check, where each construction is formatted as "#define name expression" and the expression is a valid arithmetic expression with variables, constants, and previously defined macros. The number of constructions n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 100. Each line can contain any number of spaces, and the length of any line does not exceed 100 characters.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is a list containing the final processed string segments or results derived from the characters in `s`, `n` is an empty string if no operands were accumulated, or it contains the last operand if it was not processed before the loop ended. The list `f` may contain empty strings and/or operator characters as defined by the input characters processed.
    if (n != '') :
        f[0] += func_1(v.get(n, '1'))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is a list containing the final processed string segments or results derived from the characters in `s`. If `n` is a non-empty string containing the last operand that was not processed before the loop ended, then `f[0]` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` to it. If `n` is an empty string, no changes are made to `f`.
    return eval(f[0]).level
    #The program returns the level of the evaluated expression represented by f[0]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` that contains a series of `#define` constructions followed by a mathematical expression. It processes the string to evaluate the expression and returns the "level" of the evaluated expression. The function handles operators and parentheses within the expression and defaults undefined variables to '1'. It is important to note that if `s` contains no valid arithmetic expression or if all variables are undefined, the function may not produce a meaningful evaluation, as it assumes the presence of valid constructs in the input string.
