The function accepts a string `c`, which contains multiple lines of input formatted as a non-negative integer followed by `#define` constructions and an expression to check. It returns a new string that wraps the entire content of `c` within the format 'macro("...")', effectively enclosing the content within the 'macro' function call syntax.
