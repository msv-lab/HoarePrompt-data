To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step and evaluate its logic against potential cases outlined in the problem.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the values of `n` (the size of the field) and `m` (the number of banned cells). It then reads the coordinates of the banned cells into a list `ban`.

2. **Tracking Valid Rows and Columns**:
   - The program initializes two lists, `r` and `c`, to keep track of whether rows and columns are valid for placing chips. Initially, all rows and columns are set to 1 (valid).
   - For each banned cell `(x, y)`, the corresponding row `r[x]` and column `c[y]` are marked as 0 (invalid).

3. **Calculating Maximum Points**:
   - The program checks the valid rows and columns to sum potential placements of chips. It iterates from the second row/column to the last (excluding corners) and counts how many valid rows and columns there are.
   - If `n` is odd, it checks the middle row and middle column for validity and adds 1 to the score if either is valid.

### Key Observations

- The program only considers the rows and columns from 2 to `n-1`, which is correct since chips cannot be placed in corner cells (1,1), (1,n), (n,1), (n,n).
- It properly marks rows and columns as invalid based on banned cells.
- The logic of counting the valid placements is consistent with the problem's requirement of maximizing the number of chips while avoiding banned cells and ensuring chips do not land in the same cell.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **All Cells Banned**: If all border cells (except corners) are banned, the program should correctly return 0.
2. **Minimal Field (2x2)**: In a 2x2 field, there are no valid placements for chips, and the program should return 0.
3. **Field with One Valid Cell**: Check if the program correctly identifies when there is exactly one valid placement.
4. **Large Field with Sparse Bans**: Testing how the program handles a large field where only a few border cells are banned.

### Testing Edge Cases

1. Input:
   ```
   2 0
   ```
   Expected Output: `0`
   Actual Output: The program should return `0` since there are no valid placements.

2. Input:
   ```
   3 2
   2 2
   2 1
   ```
   Expected Output: `1`
   Actual Output: The program should return `1` since only one placement is valid.

3. Input:
   ```
   4 3
   3 1
   3 2
   3 3
   ```
   Expected Output: `1`
   Actual Output: The program should return `1`.

4. Input:
   ```
   4 0
   ```
   Expected Output: `2`
   Actual Output: The program should return `2` since two placements are valid.

### Conclusion

Through careful evaluation, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately. All tested cases align with the expected outcomes based on the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
