Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `ban` is a list of `m` items, `r` is a list of size `n + 1`, `c` is a list of size `n + 1`, and `ans` is updated based on the sums calculated during the loop if it executes, else `ans` is 0. Additionally, `n` is odd, and either the element at index `(n + 1) // 2` of `r` or `c` is non-zero.***
