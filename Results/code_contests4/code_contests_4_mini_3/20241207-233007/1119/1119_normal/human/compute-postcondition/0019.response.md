Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `ban` is a list of `m` items, `r` is a list of size `n + 1`, `c` is a list of size `n + 1`. If `n` is odd and either `r[(n + 1) // 2]` or `c[(n + 1) // 2]` is true, then `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains 0.***
