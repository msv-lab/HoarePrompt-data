The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its signature. However, it operates on the input constraints defined in the problem statement, where it assumes `n` is an integer representing the size of the n x n checkered field (with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of banned cells (with the constraint 0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000). Each banned cell is defined by its coordinates (xi, yi), where 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, and all provided coordinates are distinct.

After executing the function body, the output will depend on the conditions of the banned cells and the size of the checkered field. The function is expected to return a specific result based on the configuration of the checkered field and the banned cells.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters implicitly defined by the constraints of the checkered field size `n` and the number of banned cells `m`, returning a result based on the configuration of the field and the placement of banned cells.**
