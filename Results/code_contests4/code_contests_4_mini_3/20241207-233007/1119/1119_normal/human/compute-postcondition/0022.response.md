Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (the size of an n x n checkered field) and a non-negative integer `m` (the number of banned cells). It processes the banned cell coordinates, updates the row and column availability, and calculates the total number of available cells. If `n` is odd and the middle cell is not banned, it increments the total by 1. Finally, it prints the total number of available cells. The function does not handle cases where `m` exceeds the total cells available or where invalid coordinates for banned cells may be provided. **
