You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two integers A and B as the input. Output the value of A + B.

However, if A + B is 10 or greater, output `error` instead.

Constraints

* A and B are integers.
* 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


A B


Output

If A + B is 10 or greater, print the string `error` (case-sensitive); otherwise, print the value of A + B.

Examples

Input

6 3


Output

9


Input

6 4


Output

error
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9.
def func():
    testSNs = raw_input().split()
    SCORE = int(0)
    for x in range(testSNs[0]):
        if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0:
            SCORE += testSNs[x]
        else:
            continue
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` and `B` are integers, `testSNs` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `SCORE` is the sum of all non-multiple-of-10 integer values from `testSNs[1:]`, or 0 if all are multiples of 10.
    print(SCORE)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers from input, sums all integers that are not multiples of 10, and prints this sum. It does not accept any parameters and has no return value. If all integers are multiples of 10, the printed score will be 0. Additionally, the function has a bug where it incorrectly attempts to use `testSNs[0]` as the upper limit for the loop, which may lead to incorrect behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
