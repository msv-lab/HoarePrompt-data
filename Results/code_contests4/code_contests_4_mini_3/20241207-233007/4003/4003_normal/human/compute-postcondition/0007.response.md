Postcondition: ***`A` and `B` are integers, `testSNs` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, and `testSNs[0]` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 1. If the integer value of `testSNs[x]` is not a multiple of 10, then `SCORE` is set to `int(testSNs[x])`. Otherwise, `SCORE` is 0, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
