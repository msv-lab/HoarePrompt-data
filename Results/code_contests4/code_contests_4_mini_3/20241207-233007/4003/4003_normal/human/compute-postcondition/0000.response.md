The variable `testSNs` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input as a string, splits it by whitespace, and stores the resulting list in `testSNs`. The values of `A` and `B` are not affected by this line of code, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 ≤ `A`, `B` ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that 1 ≤ `A`, `B` ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
