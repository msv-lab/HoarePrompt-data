The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the provided constraints, `A` and `B` are integers constrained by the condition 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9. However, since the function definition does not include parameters, it suggests that `A` and `B` may be set within the function itself or are otherwise defined in a different context. 

Given that no output details are provided, we cannot ascertain specific return values or cases. Therefore, based on the available information, we can only describe the constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It may operate within the constraints that A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9, but specific return values or behaviors are not defined.**
