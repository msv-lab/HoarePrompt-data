The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it affects the loop that is currently running. The values of `A`, `B`, and `testSNs` remain unchanged, but we skip the rest of the current loop iteration and start the next one.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers, `testSNs` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `testSNs[0]` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `testSNs[0]`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
