Postcondition: ***`A` and `B` are integers, `testSNs` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, and `testSNs[0]` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `testSNs[x]` is not divisible by 10, `SCORE` is increased by the value of `testSNs[x]`. Otherwise, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
