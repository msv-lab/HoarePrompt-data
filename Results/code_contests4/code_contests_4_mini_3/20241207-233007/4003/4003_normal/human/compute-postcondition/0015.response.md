Postcondition: ***`A` and `B` are integers, `testSNs` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `testSNs[0]` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `x` is `n + 1`. If `testSNs[x]` is not divisible by 10, then SCORE is increased by the value of `testSNs[x]`. Otherwise, we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
