The variable `SCORE` is assigned the value of `int(0)`, which converts the integer `0` into an integer (though it remains `0`). The values of `A`, `B`, and `testSNs` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that 1 ≤ `A`, `B` ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `SCORE` is 0.**
