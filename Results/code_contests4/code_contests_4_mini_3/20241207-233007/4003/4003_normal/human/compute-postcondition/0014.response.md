The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in, moving directly to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers, `testSNs` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `testSNs[0]` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is `n + 1` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
