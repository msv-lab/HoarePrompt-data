The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the loop is being executed for the first time, and since `testSNs[0]` is a valid string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 1, the loop will continue to the next iteration without making any changes to the values of `A`, `B`, `SCORE`, or `testSNs`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `testSNs` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `SCORE` is 0 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `testSNs` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `SCORE` is 0 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
