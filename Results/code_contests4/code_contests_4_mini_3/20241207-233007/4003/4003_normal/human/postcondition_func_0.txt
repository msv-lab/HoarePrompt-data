The function reads a list of integers from input, sums all integers that are not multiples of 10, and prints this sum. It does not accept any parameters and has no return value. If all integers are multiples of 10, the printed score will be 0. Additionally, the function has a bug where it incorrectly attempts to use `testSNs[0]` as the upper limit for the loop, which may lead to incorrect behavior.
