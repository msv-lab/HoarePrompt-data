Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code tries to use `raw_input()` to read input, which is not appropriate for the problem since it does not correctly handle the input format (two integers separated by a space). 

Additionally, the loop `for x in range(testSNs[0])` incorrectly uses `testSNs[0]` as a loop range, which is actually a string (the first input number), and this will result in a TypeError. 

The logic inside the loop also does not sum the integers A and B correctly; it attempts to check if each value is divisible by 10, which is irrelevant to the task of summing A and B, and does not check if their sum is 10 or greater to output "error".

For example, if the input is `6 4`, the expected output should be `error`, but the provided code will not produce this output correctly. Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
