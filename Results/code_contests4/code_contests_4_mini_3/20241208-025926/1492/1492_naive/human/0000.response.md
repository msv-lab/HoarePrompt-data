To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and consider potential edge cases.

The task is to compute the minimal number of discrete jumps Vasya needs to make to reach the n-th skyscraper based on the given rules. The program utilizes a dynamic programming approach to track the minimum number of jumps required to reach each skyscraper.

### Key Points from the Program:
1. The program initializes a `dp` array to store the minimum jumps required to reach each skyscraper.
2. It uses two stacks (`maxstack` and `minstack`) to maintain the heights of skyscrapers and their indices for efficient calculation of jumps.
3. The logic iterates through the heights and updates the `dp` array based on conditions defined in the problem description.

### Potential Cases to Test:
- **Case 1**: All skyscrapers have the same height.
    - Input: `n = 3`, heights = `[5, 5, 5]`
    - Expected output: `1` (Since he can jump directly from the first to the last).
  
- **Case 2**: Heights are in strictly increasing order.
    - Input: `n = 4`, heights = `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
    - Expected output: `3` (He needs to jump between each pair).

- **Case 3**: Heights are in strictly decreasing order.
    - Input: `n = 4`, heights = `[4, 3, 2, 1]`
    - Expected output: `3` (He needs to jump between each pair).

- **Case 4**: Alternating heights.
    - Input: `n = 5`, heights = `[1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`
    - Expected output: `4` (He needs to jump from 1 to 2, then to 4, then to 5).

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the first potential case where all skyscrapers have the same height.

**Input:**
```
3
5 5 5
```

**Expected Output:** 
```
1
```

**Program Behavior:**
1. The program initializes `dp` to `[0, 0, 0]`.
2. It does not account for the fact that if all skyscrapers have the same height, Vasya can jump directly from the first to the last.
3. Instead, the logic will incorrectly increment the jump count based on previous heights leading to an inaccurate answer.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where all skyscrapers have the same height correctly, leading to an incorrect result. Since we identified at least one potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem, the overall correctness is deemed false.

Correctness: **False**.
