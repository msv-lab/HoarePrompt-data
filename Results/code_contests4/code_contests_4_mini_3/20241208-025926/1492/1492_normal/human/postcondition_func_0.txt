The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `h` of `n` integers. It computes a dynamic programming array `dp` that represents the minimum number of operations required to process the heights in `h` based on specific conditions related to their order. Finally, it prints the last computed value in the `dp` array, which corresponds to the result for the entire list of heights. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or where the heights are outside the specified range, but it assumes valid input as per the initial conditions.
