The function accepts a tuple `o`, which contains an integer representing the total number of skyscrapers and a list of their heights. It then attempts to read a line of input, splitting it into integers and adding the value of `o` to each of those integers. However, the code does not correctly access the first element of the tuple `o` (the number of skyscrapers) nor does it utilize the heights of the skyscrapers; it simply adds the entire tuple to each input integer, which will result in a TypeError. The function is not implemented correctly according to the annotations and will fail when executed.
