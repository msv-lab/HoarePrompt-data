To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code and its annotations against the problem description. 

### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires calculating the minimal number of discrete jumps Vasya can take from the first skyscraper to the last skyscraper. A jump is defined as discrete under certain conditions involving the heights of the skyscrapers.

### Code Analysis:
The main function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum number of discrete jumps. It utilizes two stacks (`maxstack` and `minstack`) to keep track of the maximum and minimum heights encountered so far, along with their indices. 

The key operations include:
- Iterating through the heights.
- Checking conditions for jumping based on the current height and the heights stored in the stacks.
- Updating the `dp` array, which records the minimum jumps needed to reach each skyscraper.

### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations highlight that the implementation assumes valid input but does not handle edge cases explicitly:
- It does not check if the heights in `h` conform to the problem's requirements (e.g., less than 1 or more than \(10^9\)).
- There is a mention of the function `func_3`, which incorrectly attempts to use input in a way that can lead to a `TypeError` due to the summation of a tuple instead of accessing its elements properly.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Jump Validity**: The code must ensure that the conditions for a discrete jump are satisfied for every jump possibility. The logic for checking jumps seems to revolve around maintaining stacks, but there is no explicit validation of the jump conditions as described in the problem statement.
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not consider cases where heights are equal, which can be problematic for determining valid discrete jumps.
3. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_3`'s implementation is incorrect as it introduces a TypeError, suggesting that not all functions in the code are working correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the code, particularly the incorrect handling of input in `func_3` and the potential missed validation of jump conditions, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it could lead to errors and does not guarantee the correct calculation of discrete jumps under all specified conditions.
