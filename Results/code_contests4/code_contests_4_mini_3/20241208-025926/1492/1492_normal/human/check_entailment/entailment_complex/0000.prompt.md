You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the i-th one is h_i. Today some villains have set on fire first n - 1 of them, and now the only safety building is n-th skyscraper.

Let's call a jump from i-th skyscraper to j-th (i < j) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i < j and one of the following conditions satisfied: 

  * i + 1 = j 
  * max(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}) < min(h_i, h_j) 
  * max(h_i, h_j) < min(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}). 



At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach n-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — total amount of skyscrapers.

The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, …, h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — heights of skyscrapers.

Output

Print single number k — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

In the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5.

In the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.

Sequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: 1 → 3 → 5.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `dp` contains the final computed values based on the conditions of the loop; `minstack` contains the last processed values from `h`; `maxstack` contains the last processed values from `h`; `minidx` contains the indices of the elements in `h` corresponding to the values in `minstack`; `maxidx` contains the indices of the elements in `h` corresponding to the values in `maxstack`.
    debug_print(dp)
    print(dp[n - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `h` of `n` integers. It computes a dynamic programming array `dp` that represents the minimum number of operations required to process the heights in `h` based on specific conditions related to their order. Finally, it prints the last computed value in the `dp` array, which corresponds to the result for the entire list of heights. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or where the heights are outside the specified range, but it assumes valid input as per the initial conditions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and h is a list of n integers where each height h_i satisfies 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input, which can vary based on the input provided, but will contain integers split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input to retrieve a list of integers, which can contain between 2 and 300,000 integers, each ranging from 1 to 1,000,000,000. It returns this list of integers as output. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input may not meet the specified constraints, such as fewer than 2 integers or integers outside the specified range.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a tuple containing two elements: the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) representing the total number of skyscrapers, and the second element is a list of n integers h_i (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 1,000,000,000) representing the heights of the skyscrapers.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of an input integer and the tuple 'o' containing the number of skyscrapers and their heights.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `o`, which contains an integer representing the total number of skyscrapers and a list of their heights. It then attempts to read a line of input, splitting it into integers and adding the value of `o` to each of those integers. However, the code does not correctly access the first element of the tuple `o` (the number of skyscrapers) nor does it utilize the heights of the skyscrapers; it simply adds the entire tuple to each input integer, which will result in a TypeError. The function is not implemented correctly according to the annotations and will fail when executed.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 300000, and m is a list of n integers where each integer represents the height of a skyscraper and satisfies 1 <= m[i] <= 10^9 for 0 <= i < n.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n elements generated by calling func_2() n times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `m` of `n` integers representing the heights of skyscrapers. It returns a list of `n` elements, each generated by calling the function `func_2()`, which is invoked `n` times. The function does not utilize the list `m` in any way, meaning the heights of the skyscrapers do not influence the output.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000), and h is a list of n integers where each height h_i satisfies (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 1,000,000,000).
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns the result of the function f executed with the given dimensions, repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty, otherwise it returns the result of f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable `f` and a list `dim`. It executes `f` repeated `dim[0]` times if `dim` is not empty, passing the remaining dimensions from `dim` as arguments to `f`. If `dim` is empty, it simply returns the result of `f()`. Edge cases include scenarios where `dim` is empty, leading to a direct call of `f()`, or if `dim[0]` is zero, resulting in an empty list since nothing is repeated. Additionally, if `dim` has more dimensions than expected by `f`, this may lead to errors during execution.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
