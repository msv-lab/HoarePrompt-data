Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimal number of discrete jumps from the first skyscraper to the last one based on the problem description. 

1. The program uses a dynamic programming approach with a `dp` array where `dp[i]` is intended to store the minimum number of jumps required to reach the i-th skyscraper. While it initializes and updates this array, the logic for updating `dp[i]` seems to rely on the conditions for discrete jumps, but it does not explicitly check all necessary conditions as described in the problem.

2. The conditions for a discrete jump state that either:
   - The jump is to an adjacent building (`i + 1 = j`).
   - The maximum height between skyscrapers i and j is less than the minimum height of skyscrapers i and j.
   - The maximum height of skyscrapers i and j is less than the minimum height between skyscrapers i and j.

   The program, however, does not seem to implement a complete check for these conditions. Specifically, it tries to use stacks (`minstack` and `maxstack`) to track heights but does not ensure that the height conditions for all possible jumps are correctly evaluated.

3. There are also additional functions (func_3, func_4, func_5) that seem unrelated to the main functionality and do not contribute to solving the problem as described. These functions introduce unnecessary complexity and do not adhere to the task of calculating the number of discrete jumps.

In summary, the program does not adequately implement the logic necessary to find the minimum number of discrete jumps according to the rules given in the problem description. It lacks proper validation of the jump conditions and includes extraneous functions that do not serve the primary purpose. Thus, the program is not correct.
