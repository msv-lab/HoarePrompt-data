To determine the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, we analyze the functions, their logic, and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the minimum number of discrete jumps Vasya can take from the first to the last skyscraper, based on specific jumping conditions.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:** This function implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum number of discrete jumps. It utilizes stacks to keep track of the maximum and minimum heights. The DP array `dp` is updated based on the jumping conditions described in the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function reads a list of integers from input, representing the heights of the skyscrapers.

3. **Function `func_3`:** This function attempts to read input and modify it based on a value from its tuple argument. However, it has a coding error and will not function as intended.

4. **Function `func_4`:** This function seems to be intended to read multiple sets of heights but does not utilize the heights parameter correctly.

5. **Function `func_5`:** This function handles the execution context and input management but does not directly contribute to the calculation of jumps.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The hints for `func_1` indicate it computes a DP array based on specific conditions related to the heights.
- It notes that the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or heights are outside the specified range, but it assumes valid input as per the problem constraints.

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. The jumps are based on strict conditions regarding the heights. If the heights are all the same, the function might miscalculate since the jump conditions require strict inequalities.
2. The handling of the input and the way that heights are read could lead to issues if the input does not meet the assumptions.
3. The incorrect implementation in `func_3` would cause the program to fail if it were invoked, but this function is not used in the main logic.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` appears to handle the core logic of the problem adequately, as it tries to compute the minimum jumps based on the conditions provided. However, due to the presence of a function (`func_3`) that will cause errors and potential edge cases not being handled (specifically regarding equal heights), the overall program does not guarantee correctness in all scenarios.

Thus, we can confidently state:

Correctness: **False**. 

The primary issue arises from the potential for equal heights among skyscrapers not being handled correctly, which could lead to an incorrect jump count.
