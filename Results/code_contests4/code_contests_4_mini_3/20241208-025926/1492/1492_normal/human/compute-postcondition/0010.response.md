The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since `i` is 0 and the condition `i == 0` is true, this indicates that we are inside a loop, and the `continue` statement will cause the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of that loop and continue with the next iteration.

The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop where `i` is currently 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, `first` is the first element of the list `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0, `minstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `minidx` is [0], `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `ar` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
