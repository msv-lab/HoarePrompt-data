The code `minidx.pop()` removes the last element from the list `minidx`. Since `minidx` is currently an empty list, attempting to pop an element will have no effect on the state of the program, as there are no elements to remove.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`; `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0; `minstack` contains at least one element greater than `x` and now has one fewer element after the `pop`; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `x` is the first element in `ar`; `minidx` is now an empty list and we attempted to pop from an empty list.
