The code `minidx.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `minidx`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `minidx` will now include the new value of `i`, while the other variables (`n`, `h`, `first`, `maxstack`, and `minstack`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `minidx`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `maxstack` remains unchanged; `minstack` now includes `x`; `minidx` now includes the value of `i`.**
