The variable `maxidx` is modified by appending the value of `i` to it. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `maxstack` now includes `x`; `minstack` includes `x`; `minidx` includes the value of `i`; `maxidx` now includes the value of `i`.
