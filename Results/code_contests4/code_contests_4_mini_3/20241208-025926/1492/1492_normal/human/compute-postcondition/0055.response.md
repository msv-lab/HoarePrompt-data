To determine the necessary adjustments, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop:

```
while minstack and minstack[-1] > x:
```

1. The loop will execute as long as `minstack` is not empty (`minstack`) and the top element of `minstack` (`minstack[-1]`) is greater than `x`.
2. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, two conditions need to be satisfied:
   - `minstack` must not be empty.
   - The last element of `minstack` must be greater than `x`.

Given the state before the loop:

- `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1` does not provide information about `minstack` or `x`.

To ensure the loop can execute:
- We must ensure `minstack` has at least one element.
- We also need to establish a relationship between `minstack[-1]` and `x` such that `minstack[-1] > x`.

Since no specific values for `minstack` or `x` are provided, we can state that `minstack` must be non-empty and that the last element of `minstack` should be greater than `x`.

Final state adjustment:

State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1, minstack is not empty and minstack[-1] > x`**
