Postcondition: ***`minstack` has `x` appended to it, `maxstack` has `x` appended to it, `minidx` has `i` appended to it, and `maxidx` has `i` appended to it. If `i` is equal to 0, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `x` should be the next element in `ar`, continuing to the next iteration of the loop.***
