The code `minstack.pop()` removes the last element from `minstack`. Since `minstack` is not empty, its state will change as the last element is removed. The other variable `dp[i]` remains unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`, `minstack` has one less element after the pop operation.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`, `minstack` has one less element after the pop operation.**
