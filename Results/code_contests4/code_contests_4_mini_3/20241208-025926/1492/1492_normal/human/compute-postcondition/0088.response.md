Postcondition: ***`minstack` is not empty. If the last element of `maxstack` is equal to `x`, it is removed, resulting in `maxstack` having one less element, while `minidx`, `maxidx`, and the last element of `minstack` remain unchanged. If the last element of `maxstack` is not equal to `x` or `maxstack` is empty, there are no changes to `dp[i]`, `minstack`, `minidx`, `maxidx`, or `maxstack`.***
