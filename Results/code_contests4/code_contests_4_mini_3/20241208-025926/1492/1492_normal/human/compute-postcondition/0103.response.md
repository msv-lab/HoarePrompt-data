According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `minstack` and the last element of `minstack`. The loop will execute as long as `minstack` is not empty and the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `minstack` is not empty, and its last element must be greater than `x`, which means the loop can execute again. However, after the last iteration, the last element of `minstack` has been removed, and `minidx` remains empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, `minstack` must still contain at least one element that is greater than `x`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `minstack` has at least one element left after the last element was removed.

State: **`dp[i]` is now `dp[i - 1] + 1`, `minidx` is empty, and for the loop to execute again, `minstack` must have at least one element greater than x.**
