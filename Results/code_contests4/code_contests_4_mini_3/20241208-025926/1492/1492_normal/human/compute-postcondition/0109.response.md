The `maxidx` variable has an operation that removes the top element from it. This means that the last element added to `maxidx` is discarded. The previous states of `minstack` and `minidx` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The value of `dp[i]` also remains unchanged since the operation pertains only to `maxidx`.

Output State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `dp[i]` is now `dp[i - 1] + 1`, and the top element is removed from `maxstack`.**
