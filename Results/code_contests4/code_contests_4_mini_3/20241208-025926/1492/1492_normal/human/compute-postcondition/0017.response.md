The `minstack.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `minstack` list. Since `minstack` initially contains the value of `first`, which is greater than `x`, this operation will result in `minstack` being empty after the pop. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, `first` is greater than `x`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0, `minstack` is now empty, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `ar`, `minidx` is now an empty list.**
