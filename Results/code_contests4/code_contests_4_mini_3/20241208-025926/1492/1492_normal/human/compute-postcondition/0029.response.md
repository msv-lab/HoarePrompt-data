According to the code, the `while` loop can execute as long as `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `maxstack` has one less element, and since it is not empty, we need to ensure that the last element of `maxstack` is still less than `x` for the loop to execute again. 

Given that `first` is greater than `x`, it is implied that `x` must have been less than the last element of `maxstack` prior to the last iteration for the loop to have executed at all. Therefore, we need to adjust the last element of `maxstack` to ensure it remains less than `x` in the next iteration.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. We do not need to adjust any other states.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` now has one less element and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`; `minstack` is now empty; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `x` is the first element in `ar`; `minidx` is now an empty list and one element has been removed from `maxidx`.**
