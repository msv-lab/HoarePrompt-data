Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `maxstack` includes `x`; `minstack` includes `x`; `minidx` includes the value of `i`; `maxidx` includes the value of `i`; if `i` is 0, the conditions remain unchanged, and the loop will execute a second time since `i` is less than `n - 1`.***
