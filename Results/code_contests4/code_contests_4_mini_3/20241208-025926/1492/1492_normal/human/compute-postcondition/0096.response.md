The line `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1` assigns the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1` to `dp[i]`. The variable `i` has previously been appended to both `minidx` and `maxidx`, indicating it is used as an index in the `dp` list. Assuming `dp` is a list where `dp[i - 1]` is defined, the operation will effectively increase the value at index `i` by 1 compared to the value at index `i - 1`. 

Since the output state is not directly affected by the appended values of `minstack`, `maxstack`, `minidx`, and `maxidx`, we focus solely on the impact of the current line of code.

Assuming the initial condition of `i` is not zero and `dp[i - 1]` is defined, the value of `dp[i]` will now be `dp[i - 1] + 1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i]` is now `dp[i - 1] + 1`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is now `dp[i - 1] + 1`**
