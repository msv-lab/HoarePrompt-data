The last element of `maxstack` is removed by the `pop()` method. Since it is stated that `maxstack` now has one less element and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`, the output state indicates that `maxstack` has been modified but the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` has one less element; `minstack` is now empty; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `x` is the first element in `ar`; `minidx` is now an empty list and one element has been removed from `maxidx`.**
