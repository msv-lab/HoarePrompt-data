The code `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1` assigns a new value to `dp[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` equals -1. The value of `dp[-1]` is not valid in this context because it is outside the bounds of the list, which has `n` elements initialized to zero. Therefore, the code cannot be executed without an error, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, `first` is the first element of the list `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0, `minstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `minidx` is [0], `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `ar`, and an error occurs due to invalid index access in `dp[-1]`.**
