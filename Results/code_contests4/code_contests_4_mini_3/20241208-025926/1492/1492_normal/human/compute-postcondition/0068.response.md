According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `maxstack` is not empty and the top element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `maxstack` is empty (as stated). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `maxstack` must contain at least one element that is less than `x`. This means we need to adjust the state to indicate that `maxstack` should have at least one element that meets this condition.

State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` has elements removed corresponding to the number of times the loop executed, `dp[i]` remains equal to `dp[i - 1] + 1, the top element of `maxstack` has been removed, and for the loop to execute again `maxstack` must contain at least one element less than x**
