The operation `minidx.pop()` removes the last element from the `minidx` list. Since the initial state specifies that `minstack` is now empty after popping the last element, this indicates that there were previously elements in `minidx`, but after the operation, it becomes empty. 

No other variables are affected by this operation directly. Therefore, after executing the code, the only relevant change is that `minidx` is now empty. 

Output State: **`dp[i]` is now `dp[i - 1] + 1`, `minidx` is now empty, and `x` is less than the previous last element of `minstack`.**
