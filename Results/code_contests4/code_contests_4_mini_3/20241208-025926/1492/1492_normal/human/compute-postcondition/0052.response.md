The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the loop for the current iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement; however, it indicates that the loop will continue its execution under the specified conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `maxstack` now includes `x`; `minstack` includes `x`; `minidx` includes the value of `i`; `maxidx` now includes the value of `i`; `i` is less than `n - 1`, and the loop will execute a second time.
