The value of `maxidx` is modified by appending `i` to it. The other variables, `minstack`, `maxstack`, and the last element of `minstack`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `minstack` has `x` appended to it; `maxstack` now has `x` appended to it; `minidx` has `i` appended to it; `maxidx` now has `i` appended to it; and the last element of `minstack` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`minstack` has `x` appended to it; `maxstack` now has `x` appended to it; `minidx` has `i` appended to it; `maxidx` now has `i` appended to it; and the last element of `minstack` remains unchanged.**
