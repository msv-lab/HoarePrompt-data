According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `minstack` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `minstack` is not empty and the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` is not empty and `minstack[-1] > x`, which means the loop can execute again. However, we need to ensure that `minstack` still remains not empty and that the last element is still greater than `x` after removing the last element in the previous iteration.

Since the last element of `minstack` has been removed, we need to adjust `minstack` to ensure it still has elements that satisfy the loop condition. Therefore, we must specify that for the loop to execute one more time, the new last element of `minstack` (after the previous pop) must also be greater than `x`.

State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`, `minstack` is not empty and for the loop to execute again, the new last element of `minstack` must be greater than x**
