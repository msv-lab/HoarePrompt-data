Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value (0) and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1` if `maxidx` is non-empty; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 0; the `minstack` is not empty and the top element of `minstack` is equal to `x`.***
