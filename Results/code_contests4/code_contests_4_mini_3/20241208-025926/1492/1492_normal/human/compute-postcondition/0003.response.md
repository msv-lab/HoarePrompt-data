The variable `dp` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n`, where `n` is an integer from input in the range 2 to 300000. The previous values of `n` and `h` remain unchanged, and `first` also retains its value as the first element of `h`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is the first element of the list `h`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is the first element of the list `h`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.**
