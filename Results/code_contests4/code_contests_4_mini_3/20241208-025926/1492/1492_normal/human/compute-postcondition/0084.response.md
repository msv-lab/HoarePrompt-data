Postcondition: ***`minstack` is not empty. If the last element of `minstack` is equal to `x`, it is removed, while `minidx`, `maxidx`, and `maxstack` remain unchanged. If `minstack` is empty or its last element is not equal to `x`, there are no changes to `dp[i]`, `minstack`, `minidx`, `maxidx`, or `maxstack`.***
