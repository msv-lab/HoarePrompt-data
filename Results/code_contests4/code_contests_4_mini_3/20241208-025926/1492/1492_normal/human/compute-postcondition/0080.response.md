Postcondition: ***`minstack` is empty and `minidx` has all elements removed corresponding to the total number of times the loop executed. If `maxidx` is not empty, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`, while `maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`. If `maxidx` is empty, there are no changes to `dp[i]`, `minstack`, or `maxstack`.***
