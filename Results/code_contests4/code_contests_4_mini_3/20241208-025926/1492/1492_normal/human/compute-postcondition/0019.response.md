According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `minstack` and the condition that its last element must be greater than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` is empty, which means the loop cannot execute again since the condition `minstack` must be truthy (non-empty) to enter the loop. 

To allow for the loop to execute one more time, `minstack` needs to contain at least one element that is greater than `x`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `minstack` is filled with appropriate values.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`; `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0; `minstack` contains at least one element greater than `x`; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `x` is the first element in `ar`; `minidx` is now an empty list.**
