Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`. If the top element of `minstack` equals `x`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged and the top element of `minidx` is removed. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unaffected as there is no else part.***
