The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`. Assuming `i` is within the valid range (0 to `n - 1`), `dp[i - 1]` is used to calculate the new value of `dp[i]`. The output state does not change other variables directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1**
