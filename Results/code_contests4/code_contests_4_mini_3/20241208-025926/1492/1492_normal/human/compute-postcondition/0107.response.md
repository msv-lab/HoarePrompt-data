According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the state of the variable `maxstack`. The loop can execute if `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. 

Right before the loop, `maxstack` is not mentioned in the provided state, but since we need it to not be empty for the loop to run, we can infer that `maxstack` must contain at least one element. Additionally, since `maxstack[-1]` must be less than `x`, we need to adjust the last element of `maxstack` to ensure that it satisfies this condition.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `maxstack` needs to have at least one element that is less than `x`. 

State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `dp[i]` is now `dp[i - 1] + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `maxstack` must contain at least one element less than x**
