The code `minidx.pop()` removes the last element from the list `minidx`. The previous value of `minidx` is [0], so after executing the pop operation, `minidx` will be an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, `first` is the first element of the list `h` and must be greater than `x`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0, `minstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `ar`, `minstack` is modified to remove its last element, `minidx` is now an empty list.**
