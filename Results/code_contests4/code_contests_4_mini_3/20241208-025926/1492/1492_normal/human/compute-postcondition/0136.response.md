The `debug_print(dp)` function is called to print the contents of the `dp` variable. No modifications to the state of `n`, `h`, `minstack`, `maxstack`, `minidx`, or `maxidx` occur during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current variables without any changes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `dp` contains the final computed values based on the conditions of the loop; `minstack` contains the last processed values from `h`; `maxstack` contains the last processed values from `h`; `minidx` contains the indices of the elements in `h` corresponding to the values in `minstack`; `maxidx` contains the indices of the elements in `h` corresponding to the values in `maxstack`; The contents of `dp` have been printed.**
