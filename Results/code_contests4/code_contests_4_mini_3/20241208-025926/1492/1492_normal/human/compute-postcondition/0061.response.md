According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `minstack` and `x`. The loop will continue executing as long as `minstack` is not empty and the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` has one less element after the pop operation, which means it still has elements, but we do not know the value of the last element after the pop.

For the loop to execute one more time, the last element of `minstack` (after the pop) must still be greater than `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`.

State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`, minstack has one less element after the pop operation and for the loop to execute again, the last element of minstack must be greater than x**
