Postcondition: ***`minstack` is not empty and the top element of `minstack` is equal to `x`, `minidx` is not empty, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1` if `maxidx` is not empty. If `maxidx` is empty, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged, `maxstack` remains empty, and `maxidx` is not empty.***
