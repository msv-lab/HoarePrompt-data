According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `maxstack` is now empty, which means the loop cannot execute again since the first condition (`maxstack`) is not satisfied. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `maxstack` needs to contain at least one element that is less than `x`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` needs to contain at least one element less than `x`; `maxidx` is now empty; `minstack` is now empty; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `x` is the first element in `ar`; `minidx` is now an empty list.**
