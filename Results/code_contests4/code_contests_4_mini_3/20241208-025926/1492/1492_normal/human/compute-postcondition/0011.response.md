Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, `first` is the first element of the list `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0, `minstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `minidx` is [0], `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `ar`, and since `i` is equal to 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
