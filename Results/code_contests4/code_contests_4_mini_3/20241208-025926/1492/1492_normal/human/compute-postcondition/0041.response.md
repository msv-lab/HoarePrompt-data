The operation `minidx.pop()` removes the top element from the list `minidx`. Since the initial state mentions that `dp[i]` is updated based on the contents of `maxidx`, and `minstack` has its top element removed (which is `x`), it indicates that `minidx` is being modified but does not affect the values of `n`, `h`, `first`, or `dp`. 

The effect of `minidx.pop()` is that the last element in `minidx` is removed, but we do not have information about the specific elements in `minidx` or its previous state. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp[i]` remains the same; the top element of `minidx` is removed.**
