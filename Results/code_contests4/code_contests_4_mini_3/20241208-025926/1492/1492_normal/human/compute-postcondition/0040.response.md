The code `minstack.pop()` removes the top element from `minstack`. Since it is stated that `minstack` is not empty and its top element is equal to `x`, this action will effectively remove `x` from the `minstack`. The other variables (`n`, `h`, `first`, `dp`, and `maxidx`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: the top element of `minstack` which is `x` is removed, and the remaining elements of `minstack` are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value (0) and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1` if `maxidx` is non-empty; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 0; the top element of `minstack` which is `x` is removed.**
