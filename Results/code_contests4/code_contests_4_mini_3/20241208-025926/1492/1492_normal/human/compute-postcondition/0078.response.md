Postcondition: ***`minstack` is empty, `minidx` has all elements removed corresponding to the total number of times the loop executed, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`, `maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` is not empty. If `minidx` is empty, there are no changes to `dp[i]`, `minstack`, or `maxstack`.***
