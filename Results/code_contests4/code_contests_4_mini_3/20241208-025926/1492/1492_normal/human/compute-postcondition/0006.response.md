`minstack` is assigned a list containing the value of `first`. The previous state indicates that `first` is the first element of the list `h`. Therefore, `minstack` now contains that single value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is the first element of the list `h`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`; `maxidx` is a list containing the value 0; `minstack` is a list containing the value of `first`.**
