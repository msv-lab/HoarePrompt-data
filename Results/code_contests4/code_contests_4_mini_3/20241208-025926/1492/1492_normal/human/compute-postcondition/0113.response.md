According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. The loop can execute if `maxstack` is not empty and the top element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `maxstack` must not be empty and the top element of `maxstack` must be less than `x`, and that the top element has been removed from `maxstack`.

Since the top element has already been removed from `maxstack`, for the loop to execute one more time, `maxstack` must contain at least one more element that is still less than `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `maxstack` is not empty and that its new top element is less than `x`.

State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `dp[i]` is now `dp[i - 1] + 1`, `maxstack` contains at least one element less than x**
