Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; if `maxstack` is not empty and the top element of `maxstack` equals `x`, then the top element of `maxstack` is removed, and `maxidx` is now one element shorter. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unaffected.***
