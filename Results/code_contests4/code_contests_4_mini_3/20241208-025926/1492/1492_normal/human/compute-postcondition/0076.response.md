The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. The previous value of `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i - 1] + 1`. The variable `minidx` is not empty, so `minidx[-1]` references the last element of `minidx`, which allows access to the corresponding value in `dp`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `minstack` is empty, `minidx` has all elements removed corresponding to the total number of times the loop executed, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`, `maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, and `minidx` is not empty.

Output State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` has all elements removed corresponding to the total number of times the loop executed, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`, `maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, and `minidx` is not empty.**
