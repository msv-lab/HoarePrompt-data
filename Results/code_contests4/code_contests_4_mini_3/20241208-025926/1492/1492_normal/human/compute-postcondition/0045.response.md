The `maxidx.pop()` operation removes the top element from the `maxidx` stack. Since the initial state specifies that `maxstack` is not empty, the removal of the top element from `maxidx` will occur without affecting other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `maxstack` is not empty; the top element of `maxstack` has been removed; `maxidx` is now one element shorter.**
