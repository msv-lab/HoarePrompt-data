Output State: **`minstack` has `x` appended to it; `maxstack` has `x` appended to it; `minidx` has `i` appended to it; `maxidx` has `i` appended to it; `i` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute a second time; `x` should be the next element in `ar`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
