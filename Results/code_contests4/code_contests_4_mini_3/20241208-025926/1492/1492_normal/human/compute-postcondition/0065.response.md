According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. The loop can execute if `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. Right before the loop, `maxstack` is stated to be empty, which means it does not satisfy the first condition for the loop to execute. Since `maxstack` is empty, it needs to be adjusted to include at least one element that is less than `x` for the loop to execute.

State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` has elements removed corresponding to the number of times the loop executed, `dp[i]` remains equal to `dp[i - 1] + 1, for the loop to execute the first time maxstack must contain an element less than x**
