The operation `minidx.pop()` removes the last element from the `minidx` list, reducing its length by one. The value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged as it is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`, which is not affected by the pop operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`, `minstack` has one less element after the pop operation.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`, `minstack` has one less element after the pop operation.**
