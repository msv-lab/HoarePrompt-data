The `maxidx` list has its last value removed through the `pop()` method. The initial state indicates that `maxidx` contains the value `[0]`. After executing `maxidx.pop()`, the last value, which is `0`, is removed. This affects `maxidx`, leading it to become an empty list. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `first` is greater than `x`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` is now empty after popping its last value; `maxidx` is now empty; `minstack` is now empty; `ar` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `x` is the first element in `ar`; `minidx` is now an empty list.**
