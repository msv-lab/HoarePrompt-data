The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `h`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and `h` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `h_i` must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the heights in the list `h`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `h` of `n` integers, where `n` is between 2 and 300000 and each integer in `h` is between 1 and 10^9.**
