The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `m` of `n` integers representing the heights of skyscrapers. It returns a list of `n` elements, each generated by calling the function `func_2()`, which is invoked `n` times. The function does not utilize the list `m` in any way, meaning the heights of the skyscrapers do not influence the output.
