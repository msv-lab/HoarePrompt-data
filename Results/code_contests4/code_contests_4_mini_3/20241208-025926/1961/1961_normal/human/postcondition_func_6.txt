The function accepts a variable-length argument list where the first element is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, `k`, followed by an array of `n` positive integers. The function prints the arguments if `debug` is true, but does not return any results or process the test cases further, as there are no additional computations or return statements in the provided code.
