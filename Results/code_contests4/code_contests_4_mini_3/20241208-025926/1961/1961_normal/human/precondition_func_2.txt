t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500) representing the number of elements in the array, m is a positive integer representing your position in line (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) representing the number of people whose choices you can fix; the second line of each test case contains n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array.
