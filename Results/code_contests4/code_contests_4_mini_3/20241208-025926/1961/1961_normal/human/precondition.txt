t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.
