s is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer t (the number of test cases), followed by t tuples, each containing three integers n, m, k (representing the number of elements in the array, your position in line, and the number of people whose choices you can fix) and n positive integers representing the elements of the array. The constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the array.
