The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `lcut` is calculated as max(0, pl - l + 1); `rcut` is calculated as max(0, r - pr + 1); either `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
