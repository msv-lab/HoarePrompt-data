Postcondition: ***`lcut` and `rcut` are calculated values based on the given formulas. If `rcut` is less than or equal to `k` and `pr - l` is greater than or equal to `seglen`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (0) and the return value of `func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and `ans` remains 0.***
