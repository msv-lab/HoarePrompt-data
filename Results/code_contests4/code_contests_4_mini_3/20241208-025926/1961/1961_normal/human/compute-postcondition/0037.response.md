Postcondition: ***`ans` remains 0; `pi` is `pri_idx + 1`; `pl`, `pr` are assigned values from `prilist[pi]`; `lcut` is max(0, pl - l + 1); `rcut` is max(0, r - pr + 1) but cannot be fully determined due to the unknown `r`. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
