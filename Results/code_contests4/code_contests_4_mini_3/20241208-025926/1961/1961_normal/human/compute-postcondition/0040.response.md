Postcondition: ***`ans` remains 0; `pi` is updated to `pri_idx + 1`; `pl` and `pr` are assigned values from `prilist[pi]`; `lcut` is calculated as max(0, pl - l + 1); `rcut` is calculated as max(0, r - pr + 1) but its exact value cannot be determined due to the unknown `r`. If `lcut` is less than or equal to `k` and `r - pl` is greater than or equal to `seglen`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of 0 and the result of `func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the loop will continue to the next iteration.***
