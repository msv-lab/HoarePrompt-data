Postcondition: ***`lcut` and `rcut` are calculated values based on the given formulas. If `lcut` is less than or equal to `k` and `r - pl` is greater than or equal to `seglen`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (0) and the return value of `func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and `ans` remains 0.***
