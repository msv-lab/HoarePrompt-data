Postcondition: ***`ans` remains 0, `pi` is `pri_idx + 1`, `v`, `pl`, `pr` are assigned from `prilist[pi]`, `lcut` is either `pl - l + 1` or 0, `rcut` is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on the values of `r` and `pr`. If either `lcut` or `rcut` is 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or structure.***
