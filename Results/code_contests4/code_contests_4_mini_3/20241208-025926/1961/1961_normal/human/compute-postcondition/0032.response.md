According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pri_idx` and the length of `prilist`. If `pi` is less than `len(prilist) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pi` is `pri_idx`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `pi` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `pi` will become `pri_idx + 1` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute again, `pri_idx` must be less than `len(prilist) - 1`. Thus, if `pri_idx` is currently less than `len(prilist) - 1`, it should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`ans` remains 0, for the loop to execute a second time `pi` is `pri_idx + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `pri_idx` must be less than `len(prilist) - 1**
