The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly in. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` remains 0; `pi` is `pri_idx + 1`; `pl`, `pr` are assigned values from `prilist[pi]`; `lcut` is max(0, pl - l + 1); `rcut` is max(0, r - pr + 1) but cannot be fully determined due to the unknown `r`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
