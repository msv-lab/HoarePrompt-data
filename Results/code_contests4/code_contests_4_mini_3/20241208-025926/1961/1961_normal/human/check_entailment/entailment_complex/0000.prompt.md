You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your n - 1 friends have found an array of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. You have decided to share it in the following way: All n of you stand in a line in a particular order. Each minute, the person at the front of the line chooses either the first or the last element of the array, removes it, and keeps it for himself. He then gets out of line, and the next person in line continues the process.

You are standing in the m-th position in the line. Before the process starts, you may choose up to k different people in the line, and persuade them to always take either the first or the last element in the array on their turn (for each person his own choice, not necessarily equal for all people), no matter what the elements themselves are. Once the process starts, you cannot persuade any more people, and you cannot change the choices for the people you already persuaded.

Suppose that you're doing your choices optimally. What is the greatest integer x such that, no matter what are the choices of the friends you didn't choose to control, the element you will take from the array will be greater than or equal to x?

Please note that the friends you don't control may do their choice arbitrarily, and they will not necessarily take the biggest element available.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of elements in the array, your position in line and the number of people whose choices you can fix.

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.

Output

For each test case, print the largest integer x such that you can guarantee to obtain at least x.

Note

In the first test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the last element and the second person to take the first element.

  * the first person will take the last element (5) because he or she was forced by you to take the last element. After this turn the remaining array will be [2, 9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * the second person will take the first element (2) because he or she was forced by you to take the first element. After this turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * if the third person will choose to take the first element (9), at your turn the remaining array will be [2, 3, 8] and you will take 8 (the last element); 
  * if the third person will choose to take the last element (8), at your turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3] and you will take 9 (the first element). 



Thus, this strategy guarantees to end up with at least 8. We can prove that there is no strategy that guarantees to end up with at least 9. Hence, the answer is 8.

In the second test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the first element. Then, in the worst case, both the second and the third person will take the first element: you will end up with 4.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, k followed by a list of n positive integers representing the array elements. n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3500), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1). The elements of the array are positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 3500.

    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) followed by a list of n positive integers. The function does not process the test cases or return any results; instead, it simply writes the string representation of the entire input list to the standard output. There is no handling of the integers or the array elements in the provided implementation.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer t (the number of test cases), followed by t tuples, each containing three integers n, m, k (representing the number of elements in the array, your position in line, and the number of people whose choices you can fix) and n positive integers representing the elements of the array. The constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the array.
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `s`, where each tuple contains test case information including a number of elements in an array, a position in line, a number of people whose choices can be fixed, and the array of integers themselves. The function writes the string representation of `s` to standard output but does not perform any processing or return any results based on the test case information. It does not handle any potential cases for processing the input data or generating results.

def func_3():
    return int(readln().strip())
    #The program returns an integer from the input line after stripping any whitespace. The integer represents the first value read from the input, which corresponds to the number of test cases or elements as per the context provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a single integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases, and returns that integer. It does not handle any additional logic or edge cases related to the test cases or the subsequent input lines.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases where each test case has three integers n, m, k such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, followed by n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of n positive integers converted from the input values read, which are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input containing multiple integers and returns an iterable of integers converted from the input values. The input should consist of integers where the first integer represents `n`, the count of subsequent integers, which are all positive integers. The function does not handle any input validation or errors that may arise from incorrect input formats.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500) is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, m is a positive integer representing your position in line (1-indexed), and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) is a non-negative integer representing the number of people whose choices you can fix. The array consists of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_5():
    return readln().strip()
    #The program returns a string input from the user, which is the first line read and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string input from the user, which is the first line read and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. It does not handle any exceptions related to input reading or empty input cases, so if the input is empty after stripping, it will return an empty string.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array consists of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns an array of strings representing the input values read from the standard input, split by whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns an array of strings that represent the input values read from the standard input, split by whitespace. It assumes the input contains valid strings and does not handle any potential input errors or exceptions.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are three integers n (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500), m (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) followed by n positive integers representing the elements of the array (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `debug` is true, the output will print the string representation of each element in `args` joined by spaces. If `debug` is false, there is no output generated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length argument list where the first element is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, `k`, followed by an array of `n` positive integers. The function prints the arguments if `debug` is true, but does not return any results or process the test cases further, as there are no additional computations or return statements in the provided code.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers representing the range of the array indices, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of people whose choices can be fixed, A is a list of positive integers representing the elements of the array, prilist is a list of integers representing the indices of the people whose choices are fixed, pri_idx is an integer representing the current index in the prilist, and seglen is an integer representing the length of the segment of the array being considered.

    for pi in xrange(pri_idx, len(prilist) - 1):
        v, pl, pr = prilist[pi]
        
        lcut = max(0, pl - l + 1)
        
        rcut = max(0, r - pr + 1)
        
        if lcut == 0 or rcut == 0:
            continue
        
        ans = 0
        
        if lcut <= k and r - pl >= seglen:
            ans = max(ans, func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen))
        
        if rcut <= k and pr - l >= seglen:
            ans = max(ans, func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen))
        
        if ans:
            return ans
        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lcut` and `rcut` are final calculated values based on the last index in `prilist`, `ans` is 0 if no conditions were met to update it, `pi` is equal to `len(prilist) - 1`, and the loop has completed without returning a non-zero `ans`.
    ans = 10000000000.0
    for i in xrange(l, r + 1):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the minimum of the maximum values from the valid indices accessed in `A`, `pi` is equal to `len(prilist) - 1`, `lcut` and `rcut` are unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum of the maximum values from the valid indices accessed in matrix 'A'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `l`, `r`, `k`, and `seglen`, a list of positive integers `A`, a list of integers `prilist`, and an integer `pri_idx`. It recursively computes the minimum of the maximum values in the specified ranges of `A` while considering certain constraints based on the `prilist`. If no valid segments are found, it returns a large constant value. The function effectively checks the boundaries defined by `l` and `r` and adjusts the number of available choices `k`, returning the minimum of maximum values in the range `[l, r]` that can accommodate a segment of length `seglen`. If no valid segment exists, it results in returning a large value instead.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
