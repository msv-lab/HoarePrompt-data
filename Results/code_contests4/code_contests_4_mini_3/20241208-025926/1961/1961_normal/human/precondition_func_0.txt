s is a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, k followed by a list of n positive integers representing the array elements. n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3500), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1). The elements of the array are positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
