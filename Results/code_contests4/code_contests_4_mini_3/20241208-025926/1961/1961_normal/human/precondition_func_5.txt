t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array consists of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
