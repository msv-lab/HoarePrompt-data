The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) followed by a list of n positive integers. The function does not process the test cases or return any results; instead, it simply writes the string representation of the entire input list to the standard output. There is no handling of the integers or the array elements in the provided implementation.
