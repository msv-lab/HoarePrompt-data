t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500) is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, m is a positive integer representing your position in line (1-indexed), and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) is a non-negative integer representing the number of people whose choices you can fix. The array consists of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
