args is a variable-length argument list where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are three integers n (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500), m (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) followed by n positive integers representing the elements of the array (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
