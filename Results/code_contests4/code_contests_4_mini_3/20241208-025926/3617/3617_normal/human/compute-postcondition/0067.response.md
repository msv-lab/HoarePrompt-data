The variable `m` is being reassigned to an empty list. This means that all previous values stored in `m` are lost, and it will now contain no elements. The values of `N` and `diff` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`; `m` is now an empty list; `diff` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`; `m` is now an empty list; `diff` remains unchanged.**
