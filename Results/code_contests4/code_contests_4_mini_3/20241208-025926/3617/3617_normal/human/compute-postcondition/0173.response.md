The variable `left` is updated by adding the value of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` to its current value. The variable `j` is 3 and `i` is 4, so we will calculate `abs(diff[3] - diff[4])` and add this to the existing value of `left`. The values of `m`, `N`, `A`, and `diff` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `left` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 4, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[3] - diff[4])`, `j` is 3**
