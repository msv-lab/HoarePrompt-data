The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Since `j` is `i + 1`, the new value of `right` will be updated with the term `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, and `right` is updated to `right + abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, and `right` is updated to `right + abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])**
