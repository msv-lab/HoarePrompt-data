Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than 2, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 2, `left` is equal to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, `right` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[2])` for `j` from `3` to `N - 1; `m` now includes the value of `left + right`.**
