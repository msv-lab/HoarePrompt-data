According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again if `j` can take on a value less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means `j` has taken on the value 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2, and `j` will then range from 0 to 1.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, left is updated based on the absolute difference of `diff[j]` and `diff[1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 2.**
