The variable `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is also 2, the calculation simplifies to `abs(diff[2] - diff[2])`, which equals `abs(0)`, resulting in 0. The previous value of `left` is unknown, but it will remain unchanged since we are adding 0 to it. Therefore, the output state reflects that `left` is unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `left` is unchanged.**
