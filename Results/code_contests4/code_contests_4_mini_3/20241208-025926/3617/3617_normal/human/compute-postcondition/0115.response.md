The code updates the variable `right` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is `N - 1` and `i` is `N - 2`, this means we are calculating `abs(diff[N - 1] - diff[N - 2])`. The previous value of `right` is 0, so after execution, `right` will be equal to `abs(diff[N - 1] - diff[N - 2])`. The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `left` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 2`, `j` is `N - 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j < i, `right` is abs(diff[N - 1] - diff[N - 2]), and `m` has appended the value of `left + right` at each iteration.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 2`, `j` is `N - 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j < i, `right` is abs(diff[N - 1] - diff[N - 2]), `m` has appended the value of `left + right` at each iteration.**
