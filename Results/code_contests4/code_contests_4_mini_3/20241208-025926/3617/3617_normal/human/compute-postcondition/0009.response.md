The expression `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` modifies the value of `left` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The initial state indicates that `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `left` is 0. The variable `diff` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be an array or list from which values can be accessed using the indices `j` and `i`.

Since `i` is 1, the calculation involves `diff[1]` and `diff[j]`. The exact values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are unknown, but they will affect the value of `left`. The previous value of `left` is 0, and it will be updated based on the expression.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `left` is updated based on the absolute difference of `diff[j]` and `diff[1]`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `left` is updated based on the absolute difference of `diff[j]` and `diff[1]**
