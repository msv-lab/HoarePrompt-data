Given the initial state and the loop code, we can analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i`, which means it will execute `i` times. During each iteration, it adds the absolute difference between the `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` to `left`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop complete, `left` will contain the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` values (for `j` from `0` to `i-1`) and `diff[i]`.

Since `N` is greater than `0` and `i` is less than `N - 1`, the loop will execute `i` times, and `left` will be increased accordingly. 

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i - 1`, and `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1.**
