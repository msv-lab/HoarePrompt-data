The variable `right` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables, `N`, `i`, `j`, and `left`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i - 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, and `right` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i - 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, and `right` is 0.**
