The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `N` (which is greater than 0) and `i` (which is 0). The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is 0**
