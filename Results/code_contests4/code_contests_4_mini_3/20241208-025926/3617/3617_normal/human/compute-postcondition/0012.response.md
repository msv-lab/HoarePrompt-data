According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is less than 2. This means that the loop has executed for `j` equal to 0 and 1. For the loop to execute a third time, `j` must be incremented to 2.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `j` will be 2 for the next iteration, and since `i` is 2, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than 2, which will not be satisfied as `j` will be equal to `i`.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference of `diff[j]` and `diff[2]`, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than 2, which it will not be as `j` is 2.**
