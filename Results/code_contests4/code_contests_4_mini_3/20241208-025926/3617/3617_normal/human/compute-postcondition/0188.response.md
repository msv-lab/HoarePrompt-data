The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `argv`. The parameter `argv` is expected to be a list of integers, where the first element represents a positive integer `N` that satisfies the constraint 1 <= N <= 200000. The subsequent elements in the list `A` (where the length of `A` is N) consist of integers that satisfy the constraint 1 <= A_i <= 10^9. After executing the function body, the output will depend on the logic implemented within the function, which is not specified here. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `argv` containing a positive integer followed by `N` integers, and it processes these inputs according to its internal logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter argv, which is a list with the first element as a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 200000) followed by N integers (1 <= A_i <= 10^9).**
