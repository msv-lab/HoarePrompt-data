Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than 4, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 2, `left` is equal to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, `right` is updated to `right + abs(diff[3] - diff[2])`, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be 3 and `N` is greater than 4.**
