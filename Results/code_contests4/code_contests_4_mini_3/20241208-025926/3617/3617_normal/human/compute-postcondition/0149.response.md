The value of `left` is assigned to 0. The previous value of `left` is not specified in the initial state, but it is being reset to 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than 2, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 2, `j` is `N - 1`, `right` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all valid `j` values, `left` is now 0.

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than 2, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 2, `j` is `N - 1`, `right` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all valid `j` values, `left` is now 0.**
