Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `left` is updated based on the sum of the absolute differences of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and `right` is updated by adding the absolute differences of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1`.**
