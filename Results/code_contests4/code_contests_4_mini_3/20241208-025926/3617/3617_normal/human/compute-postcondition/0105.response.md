The value of `left` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `left` was the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all valid `j` values where `j < i`, but that is now overridden to `0`. The values of `i`, `j`, `right`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 1`, `j` is `N - 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j > i; `m` has appended the value of `left + right`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 1`, `j` is `N - 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j > i; `m` has appended the value of `left + right`.**
