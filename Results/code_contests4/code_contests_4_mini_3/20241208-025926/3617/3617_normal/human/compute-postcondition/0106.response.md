According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `i - 1`. Given that `i` is `N - 1` and `N` is greater than `1`, `i` is at least `1`, ensuring that there are valid values for `j` to iterate over. 

Before the loop starts, `N` being greater than `1` allows `i` to be `N - 1`, which is at least `1`. Therefore, the valid range for `j` will be from `0` to `i - 1` (which is `N - 2`). 

At the start of the loop:
- `j` should be set to `0` for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 1`, `j` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j > i, `m` has appended the value of `left + right`**
