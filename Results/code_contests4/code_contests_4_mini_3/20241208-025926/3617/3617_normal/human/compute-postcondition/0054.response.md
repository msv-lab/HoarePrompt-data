According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute for the next value of `j` if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `N - 1`, which means `j` is currently `i + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value, which is `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`, which implies that `i + 2` must be less than `N`. 

So, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`. 

The updated states will be:
- `j` will be `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, `right` is updated to abs(diff[j] - diff[i]), `m` now includes the value `left + right` appended to it, for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than `i + 2`**.
