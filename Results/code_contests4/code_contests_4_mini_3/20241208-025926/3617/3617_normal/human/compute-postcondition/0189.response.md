Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 200000) and a list A of N integers (1 <= A_i <= 10^9). It calculates the sorted differences between each element in A and its 1-based index, computes the sum of absolute differences for each index in the sorted differences list, and prints the minimum sum of these differences. The function continues processing until there are no more lines of input. **
