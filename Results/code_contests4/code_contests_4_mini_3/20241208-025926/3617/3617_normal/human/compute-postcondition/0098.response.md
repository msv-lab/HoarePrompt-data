According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `N`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `N - 1`, so `i + 1` is at most `N - 1`. Therefore, `j` will begin at `i + 1` and can take values up to `N - 1`. 

Since `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` can take on the next value after `i`, which is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `i + 1`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 1` (i.e., greater than `N - 1`).

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `N - 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i + 1`**
