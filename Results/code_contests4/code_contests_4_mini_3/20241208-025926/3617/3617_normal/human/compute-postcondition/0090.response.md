According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i` and the range defined for `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The loop will now iterate with `j` taking values from 0 to 1.

Since `N` is greater than 1, it remains unchanged, and `left` will be updated again based on the new calculation involving `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `left` is updated by adding abs(diff[j] - diff[i]), for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 2**
