According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop range is defined as `range(i + 1, N)`, which means that the loop will iterate starting from `i + 1` up to `N - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 1` must be less than `N`. 

Given that `i` is currently less than `N - 1`, it follows that `i + 1` will definitely be less than `N`. Therefore, the loop can execute.

At the start of the loop:
- `N` is greater than 0
- `i` is less than `N - 1`, which implies `i + 1` is less than `N`
- `j` will be initialized to `i + 1` when the loop starts.

Thus, the state before the loop starts can remain as it is, with the addition that `j` will be equal to `i + 1` when the loop begins.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, and `right` is 0**
