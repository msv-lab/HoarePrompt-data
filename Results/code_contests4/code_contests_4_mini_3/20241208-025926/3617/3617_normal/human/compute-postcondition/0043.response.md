The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the other variables since they retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `N`, `left` is 0, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from i + 1 to N - 1; `m` now includes the value `left + right` appended to it.
