According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `N`, which means `j` must have valid values in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. Given that `N` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `N - 1` for the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` holds the final value after all iterations, which means it must be adjusted to be less than `N - 1` to allow `j` to have a valid initial value.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `N - 1` for the loop to execute the first time, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j < i, `right` is initialized to 0**
