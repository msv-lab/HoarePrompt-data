Output State: **`m` is an empty list, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences calculated from the loop, `j` is `i + 1`, `right` is updated to `right + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`**
