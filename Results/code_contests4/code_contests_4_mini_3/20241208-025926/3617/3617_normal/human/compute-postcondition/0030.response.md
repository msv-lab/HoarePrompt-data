According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `i` is less than `N - 1`, `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. Thus, in order to execute this loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be at least 2**
