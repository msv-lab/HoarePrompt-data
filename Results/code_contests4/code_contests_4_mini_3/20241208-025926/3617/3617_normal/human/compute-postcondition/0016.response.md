According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute if there is at least one valid iteration, which means `i + 1` should be less than `N`. Given that `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `N`, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is also less than `N` for the loop to execute at least once. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure `i` is less than `N - 1`. At the start of the loop, `j` will start from `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1, left` is updated based on the sum of the absolute differences of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`, `right` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `i + 1`**
