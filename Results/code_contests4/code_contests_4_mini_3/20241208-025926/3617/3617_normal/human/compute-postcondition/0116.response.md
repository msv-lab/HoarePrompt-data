According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `N`. The loop is set to execute for the range starting from `i + 1` up to `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N - 2`. Therefore, `j` will start at `N - 1`. 

Since `N` is greater than 1, this means that `j` will take the value of `N - 1` in the current iteration and will not execute again because `j` needs to be less than `N`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented such that `i + 1` becomes less than `N`. 

In the next iteration, `i` will need to be increased. The only way for the loop to execute again would be for `i` to be less than `N - 1`, which would require `i` to be incremented to `N - 1`. However, since `i` is currently `N - 2`, it cannot be incremented further without adjusting `N`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` would need to be updated to `N - 1`, and `j` would have to start from `N`, which is not valid.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 1`, and for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `N`, which means `N` must be adjusted to be greater than `N - 1`.**
