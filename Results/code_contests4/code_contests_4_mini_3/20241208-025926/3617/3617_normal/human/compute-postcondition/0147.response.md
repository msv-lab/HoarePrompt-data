Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than `i`, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences calculated from the loop, `j` is `N - 1` if the loop executed, or undefined if the loop did not execute, `right` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all valid `j` values, or remains 0 if the loop did not execute.**
