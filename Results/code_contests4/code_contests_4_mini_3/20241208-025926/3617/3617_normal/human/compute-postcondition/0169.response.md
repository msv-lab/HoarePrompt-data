The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is 0 and `i` is 3, the value of `left` will be updated to `left + abs(diff[0] - diff[3])`. The previous value of `left` is 0, so the new value of `left` becomes `abs(diff[0] - diff[3])`. The other variables `m`, `N`, `A`, and `diff` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 3, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[3])`, `j` is 0**.
