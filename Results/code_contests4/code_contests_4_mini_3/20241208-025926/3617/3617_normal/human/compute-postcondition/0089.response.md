The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Since `N` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1, it implies that `i + 1` (which is 2) is less than `N`. The values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not specified, so we cannot calculate an exact value for `left`. However, we can infer that `left` will increase by a positive amount since the absolute function ensures a non-negative result.

The output state reflects that `left` is updated based on the expression provided, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is updated by adding abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
