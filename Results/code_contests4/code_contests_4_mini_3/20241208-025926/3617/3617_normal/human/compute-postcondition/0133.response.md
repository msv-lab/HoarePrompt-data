The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is 0 and `i` is at least 1, this means we are calculating `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`. The current value of `left` is 0, so after execution, `left` will become `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `N`, `A`, `diff`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged in this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an empty list, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`m` is an empty list, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`, `j` is 0**
