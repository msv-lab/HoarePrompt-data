According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute again if `j` can take on a value within the range defined by `i + 1` and `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N - 1`, which means that `j` starts from `i + 1`, resulting in `j` starting from `N`. Since `j` cannot be greater than or equal to `N`, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `N` (which is not possible)**
