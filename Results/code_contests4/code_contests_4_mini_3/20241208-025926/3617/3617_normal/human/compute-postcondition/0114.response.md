According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range defined by `N`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `N`, which means that `j` can take on values starting from `i + 1` up to `N - 1`. Given that `i` is currently `N - 1`, `i + 1` equals `N`, which means that the loop cannot execute since the starting point of `j` is equal to `N`.

For the loop to execute, `i` needs to be less than `N - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to `N - 2` or less, which would allow `j` to take on valid values in the range.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 2`, `j` is `N - 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j < i, `right` is 0, `m` has appended the value of `left + right` at each iteration**
