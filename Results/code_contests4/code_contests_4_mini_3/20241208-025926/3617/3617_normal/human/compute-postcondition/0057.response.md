Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, `right` is updated to include abs(diff[j] - diff[i]), `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it, and `right` is now updated with abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) added to it.**
