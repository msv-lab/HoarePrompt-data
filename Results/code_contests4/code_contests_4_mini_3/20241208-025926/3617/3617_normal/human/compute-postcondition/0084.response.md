To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the initial state and the behavior of the loop.

Initial State: 
- `N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`.
- `i` is less than `N`.
- `left` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`.
- `right` is 0.

In the loop:
```
for j in range(i + 1, N):
    right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])
```

- The loop iterates starting from `j = i + 1` to `j = N - 1`.
- For each iteration, `right` accumulates the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.

Considering the loop's conditions:
- If `i` is less than `N - 1`, the loop will execute from `j = i + 1` to `N - 1`.
- The number of iterations of the loop will be `N - (i + 1)` which simplifies to `N - i - 1`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
- `right` will contain the sum of absolute differences `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all `j` from `i + 1` up to `N - 1`.
- If `i` is equal to `N - 1`, the loop will not execute, and `right` will remain 0.

Thus, after all iterations:
- `N` remains the same as it was initially assigned.
- `i` remains less than `N`.
- `left` remains unchanged.
- `right` is the sum of the absolute differences computed during the iterations, or 0 if the loop did not execute.

Final Output State:
Output State: **`N` is the value of `int(line)`, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, and `right` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1.`**
