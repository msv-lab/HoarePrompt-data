The variable `right` is incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. The previous value of `right` was not specified, but it is updated based on the current values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `left`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `right` without specifics on its previous state.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, `right` is updated to include abs(diff[j] - diff[i]), and `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it.**
