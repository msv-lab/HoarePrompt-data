According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `line`. The loop will continue executing as long as `line` is not empty or null. At the end of the last iteration, `line` holds the input line without a newline character. For the loop to be executed one more time, `line` must contain some content. Therefore, `line` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`m` contains `N` values representing the sum of absolute differences; the minimum value of `m` is printed, and for the loop to execute again `line` must contain some content**.
