According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, which means it will execute if `i` is at least 1. In the provided state, `i` is 3, so the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will take values from 0 up to but not including `i`. The first value of `j` will be 0. 

Since the other variables (`m`, `N`, `A`, `diff`, and `left`) do not influence the execution of the loop directly, they do not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the relevant states that need to be mentioned are just `j` and `i`.

State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 3, `left` is 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
