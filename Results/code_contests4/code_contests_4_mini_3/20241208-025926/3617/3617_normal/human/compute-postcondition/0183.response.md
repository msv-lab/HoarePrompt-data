The code `m.append(left + right)` appends the sum of `left` and `right` to the list `m`. Since `m` is initially a list containing the value of `left + right`, we will calculate the new value that will be appended. 

The value of `left` is defined as the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[3]` for `j` in the range 0 to 2, and `right` is the sum of absolute differences for `j` in the range from `4` to `N - 1`. 

After executing the code, `m` will now contain its original values plus the new value `left + right`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the original value of `left + right` and the new value appended which is also `left + right`, `N` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 3, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[3]` for `j` in the range 0 to 2, `right` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[3])` for `j` in the range from `4` to `N - 1.`**
