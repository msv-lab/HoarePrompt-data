According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `line`. The loop will execute as long as `line` is not an empty string. Right before the loop, `line` is assigned the value of the input read from `stdin` after removing the newline character. For the loop to execute the first time, `line` must contain some non-empty input. Therefore, `line` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9, and for the loop to execute the first time, `line` must be a non-empty string**.
