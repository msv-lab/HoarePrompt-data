According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`. Since `i` is less than `N - 1`, it implies that `N` is greater than `i + 2`, allowing the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` by 1, making `j` equal to `i + 3`. Thus, for the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `N`.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 3` for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `N`**
