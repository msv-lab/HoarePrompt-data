Output State: **`N` is the value of `int(line)`; `i` is less than `N`; `left` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`; `right` is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1; m` is updated to include the value `left + right`.**
