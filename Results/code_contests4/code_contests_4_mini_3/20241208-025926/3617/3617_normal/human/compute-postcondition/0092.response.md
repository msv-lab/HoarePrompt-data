According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, meaning `j` can take values 0 and 1. Since `j` must be less than `i`, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` would need to be 1, as it can take the value of 0 in the first iteration and 1 in the second iteration. After the second iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented to 2, which is not less than `i` anymore.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1, and `left` must be updated accordingly based on the calculation involving `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `left` is updated by adding abs(diff[j] - diff[i]), for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 1**
