According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the condition in the range specified in the for loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `i` is less than `N - 1`, which means `i` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

After the last iteration, `j` will be increased to 1, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `i`. 

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1, and `left` is increased by abs(diff[0] - diff[i]) for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `i`**
