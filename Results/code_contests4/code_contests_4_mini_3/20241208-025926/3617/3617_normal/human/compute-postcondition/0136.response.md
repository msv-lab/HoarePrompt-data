According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `i` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`m` is an empty list, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 2 and `j` is 2.**
