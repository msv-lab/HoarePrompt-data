According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `N`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `N - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is less than `N - 1`, which means that `i + 1` is less than `N`. 

Given that `j` is currently `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be incremented by 1. Hence, `j` will become `i + 2 + 1`, which is `i + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `N`, meaning `i + 3` must be less than `N`.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, and `right` is updated to `right + abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `N`**
