According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2, which means it can no longer be less than `i`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 2, and `j` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be at least 2**
