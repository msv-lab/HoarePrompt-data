The value of `left` is assigned 0, which directly changes the previous value of `left`. The other variables `m`, `N`, `A`, `diff`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `left`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `N` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is 3, `left` is 0.**
