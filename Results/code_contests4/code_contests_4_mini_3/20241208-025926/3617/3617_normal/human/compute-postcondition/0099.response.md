The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is `i + 1`, the expression simplifies to `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`. The previous values of `right`, `diff[i]`, and `diff[i + 1]` are not specified, but we know that `N` is greater than `i + 1`, allowing the execution of this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `right` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `right` is incremented by `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`.**
