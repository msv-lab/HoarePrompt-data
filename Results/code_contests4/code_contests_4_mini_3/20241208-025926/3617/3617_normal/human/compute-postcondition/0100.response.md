According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `N`, and `j`. The loop starts with `j` equal to `i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. Since `N` is greater than 1 and `i` is less than `N - 1`, it follows that `j` must be less than `N` for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it equal to `i + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `N - 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, and `j` is `i + 2`**.
