The statement `right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` updates the value of `right` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The variable `j` is equal to `i + 2`, which means we are accessing values in the `diff` array at the indices `i` and `i + 2`. Given that `N` is greater than `1` and `i` is less than `N - 1`, it follows that both `i` and `j` are valid indices in the `diff` array.

Since `N` must be greater than `i + 2` for the loop to execute a second time, it implies that `j` is also a valid index. The specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` will determine the change in `right`, but since they are not provided, we cannot quantify the exact value of `right` after the operation.

Therefore, we can summarize the output state as follows:
`right` is updated based on the values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `right` is updated by adding `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
