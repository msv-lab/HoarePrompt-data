According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `N`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, and since `i` is less than `N - 1`, it follows that `j` is less than `N`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is currently `i + 2`, after the next iteration `j` will be `i + 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`, which means that `i` must be at most `N - 4` (since `i + 3 < N` implies `i < N - 3`).

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, `right` is updated to include abs(diff[j] - diff[i]), and `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.**
