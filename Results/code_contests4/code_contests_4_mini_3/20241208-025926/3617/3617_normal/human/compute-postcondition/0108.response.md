According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `j`. The loop will execute for each `j` value from 0 up to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N - 1`, meaning the current valid values for `j` are from 0 to `N - 2`. 

Since `j` is initialized to 0 and needs to be less than `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `j` will be set to 1.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`, which is currently `N - 1`. Thus, for the next iteration, `j` should be 1, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `N - 1`.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 1`, `j` is 1, `left` is the previous value of `left`, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j > i, `m` has appended the value of `left + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
