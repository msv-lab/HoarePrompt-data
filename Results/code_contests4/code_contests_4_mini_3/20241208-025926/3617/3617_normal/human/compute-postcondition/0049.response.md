The code `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` updates the variable `left` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` to its current value. The variables `i` and `j` are currently 1 and 2, respectively. 

Since `N` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1, we can infer that `diff` is an array or list with at least three elements (to access `diff[1]` and `diff[2]`). The current values of `diff[i]` and `diff[j]` are `diff[1]` and `diff[2]`, respectively. 

However, since we do not have specific values for `diff` or `left`, we can only describe the impact of this line of code. The value of `left` will be increased by the absolute difference of `diff[2]` and `diff[1]`, but we cannot quantify that without knowing the actual values in `diff`.

The output state thus summarizes the changes without specific numerical results:

Output State: **`left` is updated by adding `abs(diff[2] - diff[1])` to its current value, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.**
