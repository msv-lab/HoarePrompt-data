The variable `line` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')`, which reads a line from standard input and removes the trailing newline character. The previous values of `m` remain unaffected as they are not involved in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` contains `N` values representing the sum of absolute differences; the minimum value of `m` is printed, and `line` holds the input line without a newline character.
