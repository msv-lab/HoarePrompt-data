Output State: **`m` is a list containing the values of `left + right` for each index from `0` to `N - 1`, `N` is the total number of elements in `diff`, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of absolute differences based on `A`, `i` is `N`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences calculated for the last index, `right` is 0 since there are no indices greater than `N - 1`, `j` is undefined for the last iteration.**
