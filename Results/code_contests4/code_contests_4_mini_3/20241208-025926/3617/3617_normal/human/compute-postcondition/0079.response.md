The statement `right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` modifies the variable `right` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` to it. The previous states of `N` and `i` indicate that the loop is executing, which means that valid indices `i` and `j` exist such that `0 <= i < N` and `0 <= j < N`. The exact values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not specified, so we denote them as `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, and the loop continues to execute.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, and the loop continues to execute.**
