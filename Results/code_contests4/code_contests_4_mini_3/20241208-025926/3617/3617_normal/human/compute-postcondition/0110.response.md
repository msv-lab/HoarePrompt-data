According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute for `j` values ranging from `0` to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N - 1`, which means the loop has executed for `j` from `0` to `i - 1` (i.e., from `0` to `N - 2`). 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented, which will make it `N`. However, since `j` iterates from `0` to `i - 1`, if `i` becomes `N`, the range for `j` will be `0` to `N - 1`, allowing the loop to execute again for the last time.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `left` and `right` will remain the same, and `i` will be `N`, allowing `j` to take the value of `N - 1`.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is N, `j` is N - 1, `left` is the updated value, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j > i**
