According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`, which iterates from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, meaning the only valid value for `j` in the next iteration would be 0. Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be at least 2, and `j` will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, but since `j` will no longer be less than `i` at that point, the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, the state must reflect that `j` has been incremented to 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 1**
