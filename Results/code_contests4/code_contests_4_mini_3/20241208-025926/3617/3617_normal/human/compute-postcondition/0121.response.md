Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is `N - 1`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all valid j values where j < i, `right` is abs(diff[N - 1] - diff[N - 2]), `m` has appended the value of `left + right` at least once, and now `m` has appended the new value of `left + right` again.**
