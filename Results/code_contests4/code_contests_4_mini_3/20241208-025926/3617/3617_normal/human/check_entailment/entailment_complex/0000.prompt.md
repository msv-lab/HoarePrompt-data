You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Snuke has an integer sequence A of length N.

He will freely choose an integer b. Here, he will get sad if A_i and b+i are far from each other. More specifically, the sadness of Snuke is calculated as follows:

* abs(A_1 - (b+1)) + abs(A_2 - (b+2)) + ... + abs(A_N - (b+N))



Here, abs(x) is a function that returns the absolute value of x.

Find the minimum possible sadness of Snuke.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible sadness of Snuke.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(argv):
    line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
    while line:
        N = int(line)
        
        A = [int(a) for a in raw_input().rstrip('\n').split(' ')]
        
        diff = sorted([(a - (i + 1)) for i, a in enumerate(A)])
        
        m = []
        
        for i in range(N):
            left = 0
            for j in range(0, i):
                left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])
            right = 0
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])
            m.append(left + right)
        
        print(min(m))
        
        line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `line` is an empty string, `N` is an integer representing the last input value, `A` is a list of integers corresponding to the last input, `diff` is a sorted list of differences based on the last input list `A`, `m` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences for each index from 0 to N-1 with respect to the sorted list `diff`, the minimum value of `m` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 200000) and a list A of N integers (1 <= A_i <= 10^9). It calculates the sorted differences between each element in A and its 1-based index, computes the sum of absolute differences for each index in the sorted differences list, and prints the minimum sum of these differences. The function continues processing until there are no more lines of input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
