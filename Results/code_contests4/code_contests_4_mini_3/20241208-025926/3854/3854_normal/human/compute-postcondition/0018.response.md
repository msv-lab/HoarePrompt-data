The code assigns the value `0` to `nn[j]`, where `j` is `3`. The array `nn` has its indices starting from `1`, so `nn[3]` is being set to `0`. The previous values of `nn[1]` and `nn[2]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nn[3]` is now `0`, while `nn[1]` and `nn[2]` retain their previous values of `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `nn[1]` is 0, `nn[2]` is 0, `nn[3]` is 0**
