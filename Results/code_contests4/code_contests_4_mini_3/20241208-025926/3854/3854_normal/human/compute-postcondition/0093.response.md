The value of `core[j]` is assigned the result of `i + 1`. The variable `j` is `n + 1`, which means `core[j]` will be assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous state of `n`, `j`, and `d` remains unchanged as this assignment only affects `core`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, and `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, and `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1.**
