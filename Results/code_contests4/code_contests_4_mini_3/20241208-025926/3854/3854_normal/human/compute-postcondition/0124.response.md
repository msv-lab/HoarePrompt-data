According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute from `j = 1` to `j = n`, which means `j` will take on values starting from 1 up to `n`. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n + 1`, which does not affect the execution of the loop, as `i` is not involved in the loop's condition or iteration. The variable `k` is a positive integer, but it also does not impact the execution of the loop.

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 1. Given that `k` is a positive integer and `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0, these states do not influence whether the loop executes or not.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 1 as it is within the defined range in the loop statement. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
