The value of `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is 1. Since `d` is a valid index (as `nn[d]` is not equal to 0) and the previous value of `nn[d]` is 0, it will now be updated to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0 except for `nn[d]` which is now 1, `core[1]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n - 1]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is set to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0 except for `nn[d]` which is now 1, `core[1]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n - 1]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is set to `n`.**
