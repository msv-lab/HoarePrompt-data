Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, and if `core[j]` is 0, then `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `d` is not 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `cell[d]` is false and `nn[d]` is not 0, then `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, and `nn[d]` is updated to `n + 1`. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `d` is 0, no changes are made to `core` or `nn`.***
