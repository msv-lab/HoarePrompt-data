According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 3. Also, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3 (since `j` is now 3) to satisfy the condition of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `nn[1]` is 0, `nn[2]` is 0**
