According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `k`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `j` is currently at its maximum value of `k` since the loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `k + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `nn[j]` is set to 0, for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least `k + 1`**
