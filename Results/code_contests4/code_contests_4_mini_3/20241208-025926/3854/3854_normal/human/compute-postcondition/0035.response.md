Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `core[1]` is 0, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n - 1]`, `d` is not equal to 0. If `nn[d]` was not 0 before execution, then `nn[d]` is now 1, `cell[d]` is True, and `core[j]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` was 0 before execution, then `nn[d]` is now 1, while all other `nn` values remain 0, and `cell[d]` remains false (or 0).***
