The code assigns the value `0` to `nn[j]`. The value of `j` is `3`, so `nn[3]` is set to `0`. The initial values of `nn[1]` and `nn[2]` remain unchanged, as does the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `nn[1]` is 0, `nn[2]` is 0, and `nn[3]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `nn[1]` is 0, `nn[2]` is 0, `nn[3]` is 0**
