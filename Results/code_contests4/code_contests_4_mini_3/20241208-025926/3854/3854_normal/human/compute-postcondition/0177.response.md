Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes instructions for `n` cores, each consisting of `m` integers. It tracks memory commands that could either write to a memory cell (1 to `k`) or do nothing (0). The function updates a core's state based on these commands, printing the final state of each core after processing all instructions. The logic ensures that it handles cases where memory cells are already written to, as well as tracking the most recent core that accessed a specific memory cell. It does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` are out of the specified bounds. **
