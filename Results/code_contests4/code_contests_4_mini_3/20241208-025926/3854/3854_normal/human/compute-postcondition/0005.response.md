According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0. Since `n` is assigned a positive integer value, it ensures that `i` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

At the beginning of the loop, the relevant states are:
- `i` should be initialized to 0.
- `n` should be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
