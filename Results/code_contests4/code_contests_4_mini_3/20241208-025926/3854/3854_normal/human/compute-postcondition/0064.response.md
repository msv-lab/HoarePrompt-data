According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` is `n - 1`, the next iteration will have `i` equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be less than `m`, which means that `m` must be greater than `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `n`**
