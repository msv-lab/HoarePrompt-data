The variable `cell` is assigned a list of boolean values, all initialized to `False`. The length of this list is `k + 1`, which means it will contain `k + 1` elements. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `ins` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned positive integer values from the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with a length of `k + 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned positive integer values from the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with a length of `k + 1`.**
