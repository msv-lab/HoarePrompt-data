According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 (as `i` will be incremented by 1). Therefore, `i` will be updated to 3 at the beginning of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
