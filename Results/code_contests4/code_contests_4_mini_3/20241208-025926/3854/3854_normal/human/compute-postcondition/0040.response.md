The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. Given that `j` is 2 and `i` is `n - 1`, we can conclude that `d` will be assigned the value from the 2nd index of `ins` with the  `(n - 1)`th index. The states of the other variables `n`, `i`, `k`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]**
