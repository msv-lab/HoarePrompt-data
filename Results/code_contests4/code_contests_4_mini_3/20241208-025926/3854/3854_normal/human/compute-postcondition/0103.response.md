According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has finished executing and will not execute again because `j` is now beyond the upper limit of `n`.

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` to `n + 1`. Since the loop does not execute again when `j` is `n + 1`, the next state for the loop should reflect that `j` has reached this value. 

Since there are no changes to `core`, `nn`, or other variables that would affect the loop's execution based on the last iteration, we must also ensure that all relevant states remain unchanged, except for the increment of `j`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `n`**
