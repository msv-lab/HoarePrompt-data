According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop is defined to run from `j = 1` to `j = n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, and `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
