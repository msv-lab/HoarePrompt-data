The code initializes a list of lists called `ins`. The outer list will have `n + 1` sublists, and each sublist will contain `m` zeros. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` do not change, but the `ins` variable is created with a specific structure based on these values. Therefore, the output state reflects the creation of this list structure.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned positive integer values from the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros.**
