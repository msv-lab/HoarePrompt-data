According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit determined by `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `j` is equal to `k + 1`. This means that `j` is currently at `k + 1`, which is outside of the range of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 from its current state (which is `k + 1`) to `k + 2`, and `j` must be less than or equal to `k`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be set to `k + 1` (since it was `k + 1` at the end of the last iteration).
- The loop can only execute again if `k` is at least `k + 1`, which is not possible.

Thus, the loop cannot execute again under the current conditions. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `nn[j]` is set to 0, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `k` which is not possible as `j` is at `k + 1`.**
