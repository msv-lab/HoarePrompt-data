According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times, starting with `j` equal to 1 and incrementing up to `k`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is currently set to `n`, it does not directly affect the loop's execution.

For the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2 (since the first execution corresponds to `j = 1`, the second execution corresponds to `j = 2`). The condition states that `m` must be greater than `n`, indicating that there is a dependency on `m` but it does not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2**
