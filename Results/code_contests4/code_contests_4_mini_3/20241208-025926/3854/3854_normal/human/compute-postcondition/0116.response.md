According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, and assuming `n` is less than `m`, we can conclude that `i` will be increased by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute once more, `i` must become `n + 1`, and for the loop to continue executing, `m` must be greater than `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than `n + 1`**
