To analyze the provided code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code execution step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (let's denote it as `n`).
   - `i` is equal to `n + 1`, so `i = n + 1`.
   - `k` is a positive integer (let's denote it as `k`).
   - `j` is 2, so `j = 2`.
   - `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n + 1]`, which means `d` depends on the value of `ins[2][n + 1]`.
   - The statement `cell[d]` is set to True, indicating that the value at index `d` in the `cell` array is now True.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `core[j] = core[nn[d]] = i + 1` involves multiple assignments:
     - First, calculate `i + 1`, which is `n + 1 + 1 = n + 2`.
     - The assignment `core[j] = i + 1` means `core[2] = n + 2`.
     - The assignment `core[nn[d]] = i + 1` means the value at `core` at the index `nn[d]` is also set to `n + 2`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The value of `core[2]` and `core[nn[d]]` is updated to `n + 2`.
   - Other variables, such as `n`, `i`, `k`, `j`, and `d`, remain unchanged, but we note that `cell[d]` is True.

Therefore, the output state based on the initial conditions and the code execution is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value `ins[2][n + 1]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[2]` is `n + 2`, `core[nn[d]]` is `n + 2`.**
