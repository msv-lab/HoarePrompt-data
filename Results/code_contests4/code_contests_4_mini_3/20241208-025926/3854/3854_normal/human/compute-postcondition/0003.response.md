The variable `nn` is assigned a list containing `k + 1` zeros, as it is created by multiplying the list `[0]` by `k + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ins`, and `cell` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned positive integer values from the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `False` values with a length of `k + 1`; `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros.
