The code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to the position `i + 1` of the list `ins`. The variable `i` is currently 2, so the assignment occurs at index `3` of `ins`. The input is accepted as a space-separated string, split into individual components, and each component is converted to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, the input will allow the loop to execute a second time, but the specific values of the input are not defined here.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `ins[3]` is assigned a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `ins[3]` is assigned a list of integers from the input.**
