The value of `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the calculation becomes `core[j] = (n + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `core[j] = n + 2`. The value of `j` is 1, so we are updating `core[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0, `j` is 1, `core[1]` is `n + 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0, `j` is 1, `core[1]` is `n + 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.**
