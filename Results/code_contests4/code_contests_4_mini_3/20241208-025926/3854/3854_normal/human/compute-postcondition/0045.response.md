To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we analyze the provided initial state and the operation performed.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`.

The operation performed is:
```
nn[d] = j
```

Here, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. The variable `d` has been previously assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`, but we do not know the exact value of `d` since it depends on the contents of the `ins` list.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `j`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Thus, the output state after running the code would be:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `k` is still greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `d` is still assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`.
- `nn[d]` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`, and `nn[d]` is now 2.**
