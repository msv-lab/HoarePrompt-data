The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, we can substitute to find `core[j] = (n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `core[j] = n`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`, and `core[j]` is assigned the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`, `core[j]` is assigned the value of `n`**.
