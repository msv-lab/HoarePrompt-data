According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the current value of `i` is `n - 1`, but this does not affect the execution of the loop. For the loop to execute the first time, it is necessary that `m` is greater than 0. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
