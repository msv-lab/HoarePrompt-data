The variable `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][n + 1]`. The value of `nn` at index `d` is then assigned the value of `j`, which is 3. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (a positive integer), `i` (which is `n + 1`), `j` (which is 3), and `d` (which is `ins[3][n + 1]`). The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, `d` is `ins[3][n + 1]`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3.**
