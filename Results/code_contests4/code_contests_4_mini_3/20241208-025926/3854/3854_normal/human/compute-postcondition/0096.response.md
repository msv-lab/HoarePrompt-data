The code assigns the value of `j` to `nn[d]`. Since `j` is `n + 1`, this means that `nn[d]` now holds the value of `n + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, while `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which is `i + 1`. The state of `nn[d]` is now updated to `n + 1`, but the original values of `n`, `j`, `d`, and `core` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `j` is `n + 1`; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`; `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which is `i + 1`; `nn[d]` is now `n + 1`.**
