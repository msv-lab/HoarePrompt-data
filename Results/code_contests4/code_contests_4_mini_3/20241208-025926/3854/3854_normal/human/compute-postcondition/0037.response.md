Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 1. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` is set to `n`. If `nn[d]` was not 0 before execution, then `nn[d]` is now 1, `cell[d]` is true, and `core[j]` is set to `n`. If `nn[d]` was 0 before execution, then `nn[d]` is now 1 while all other `nn` values remain 0, and `cell[d]` remains false (or 0).***
