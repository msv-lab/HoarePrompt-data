Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 3. If `core[3]` was 0, then `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][n - 1]`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[3]` is assigned the value of `n`. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is set to `True`, `core[3]` is assigned the value of `n`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 3.***
