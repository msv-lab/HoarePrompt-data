According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, which implies that `j` is currently at 2 (the starting value of `j` in this iteration). 

Given that `j` started at 1 and incremented during the loop, after the last iteration, `j` would have increased to 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` will need to increment to 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 3 and `n` must be at least 3 (since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
