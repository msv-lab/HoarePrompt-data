The value of `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `j` is currently 1, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]`. Since `cell[d]` is True and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, it indicates that `d` corresponds to a valid index in the `nn` array where we can assign a value. Therefore, after execution, `nn[d]` will be set to 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0 except `nn[d]` which is 1, `j` is 1, `core[1]` is `n + 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]`, `cell[d]` is True, `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.**
