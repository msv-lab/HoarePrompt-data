To determine the output state, we examine the assignment statement `d = ins[j][i]`.

- The variable `j` is given as 3.
- The variable `i` is defined as `n + 1`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- The code attempts to access `ins[j][i]`, which means it is indexing into a two-dimensional list or array `ins` at row index `j` (which is 3) and column index `i` (which is `n + 1`).

Since `n` must be a positive integer and is at least 1, `i` will be at least 2. 

- The output of this code depends on the values in the `ins` structure, which is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the impact on the variable `d`.

The value of `d` will be assigned the value at the position `[3][n + 1]` in the `ins` array. However, the exact value of `d` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `ins`.

Thus, the output state reflects the changes without specifying `d`'s exact value:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][n + 1]`.**
