According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute a total of `n` times, with `j` starting at 1 and incrementing by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`. Since the loop condition specifies `j` must be less than or equal to `n`, and it will now evaluate `j` as `n + 1`, it means the loop cannot execute again because `j` exceeds the upper limit.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` becomes `n + 1` and it is important to note that `n` is still a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again `n` must still be a positive integer**
