The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, we can calculate the value of `core[j]` as follows:

1. Since `i = n - 1`, we find that `i + 1 = (n - 1) + 1 = n`.
2. Thus, `core[j]` will be assigned the value `n`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `j`, `nn`, `core`, `d`, and `cell`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0, `core[1]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n - 1]`, `d` is not equal to 0, the value of `cell[d]` is true, and `core[j]` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0, `core[1]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n - 1]`, `d` is not equal to 0, the value of `cell[d]` is true, and `core[j]` is `n`.**
