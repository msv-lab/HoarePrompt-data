`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. The previous value of `d` is `ins[2][n + 1]`, which is an index. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nn[d]` is now set to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value `ins[2][n + 1]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[2]` is `n + 2`, `core[nn[d]]` is `n + 2`, `nn[d]` is 2.**
