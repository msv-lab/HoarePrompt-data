The loop initializes elements of the array `nn` from indices 1 to `k` to 0. Given that `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute exactly `k` times. After all iterations, all elements of `nn` from index 1 to `k` will be set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k`, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0.**
