The code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `ins[i + 1]`. The variable `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The `raw_input().split()` function will take input from the user (as a string), split it into separate components, and `map(int, ...)` will convert each component to an integer. The resulting integers will be assigned to `ins[1]`. However, since `ins` has not been defined in the initial state, we will assume it is an empty list or array capable of holding integer values.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ins[1]` now contains a list of integers based on user input, while the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ins[1]` is a list of integers from user input**.
