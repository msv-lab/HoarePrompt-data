Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `nn[j]` is set to 0 for all `j` in the range from 1 to `k`, `core[j]` is equal to 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n]`, `cell[d]` is false, and `nn[d]` was equal to 0 and is now updated to 1 if `nn[d]` was 0 prior to the execution of the if statement.***
