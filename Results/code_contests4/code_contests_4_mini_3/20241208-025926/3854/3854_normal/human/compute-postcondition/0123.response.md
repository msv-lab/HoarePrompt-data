The loop initializes elements of the list `nn` from index 1 to `k` to the value 0. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute `k` times, assigning the value 0 to each index of `nn` from 1 through `k`.

After all iterations of the loop, the state of the variables will be as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `k` is at least a positive integer indicating the number of iterations executed.
- The indices of `nn` from 1 to `k` are all 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0.**
