According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The loop will start with `j` initialized to 1 and will iterate until `j` is equal to `n + 1`. 

Given that `i` is `n - 1`, it doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop but indicates the value of `i` based on `n`. The variable `k` being greater than or equal to 1 and `j` being initialized to `k` doesn't affect the loop's execution, as `j` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, the conditions are satisfied with the following states:
- `n` is a positive integer (which it is),
- `j` is initialized to 1 (it will be set to 1 as per the loop definition).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and nn[1] to nn[k] are all 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
