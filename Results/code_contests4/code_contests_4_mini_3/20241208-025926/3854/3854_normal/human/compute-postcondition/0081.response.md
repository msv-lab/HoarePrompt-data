The value of `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which refers to the value at index `nn[d]` in the `core` list. Since `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n]`, and `cell[d]` is True, we know that `nn[d]` is not equal to 0. This means `core[nn[d]]` will provide a valid index. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, so the calculation results in `i + 1`, which is `n + 1`. 

Therefore, the output state considers the values as follows: 
- `core[j]` is updated to `n + 1`.
- `core[nn[d]]` is accessed, and since `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, this does not affect the validity of the operation.

Final variables that are affected:
- `core[j]` is now equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `core[j]` is equal to `n + 1`, `nn[j]` is set to 0 for all `j` in the range from 1 to `k`, `core[nn[d]]` is accessed, and `cell[d]` is True**.
