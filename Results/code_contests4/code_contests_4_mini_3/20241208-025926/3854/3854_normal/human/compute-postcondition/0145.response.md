The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial state indicates that `i` is `n + 1`. Therefore, the value of `i + 1` is `n + 2`. The variable `j` is 2, which means `core[2]` will be updated to the value of `n + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value `ins[2][n + 1]`, and `core[2]` is assigned the value `n + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value `ins[2][n + 1]`, `core[2]` is assigned the value `n + 2`**.
