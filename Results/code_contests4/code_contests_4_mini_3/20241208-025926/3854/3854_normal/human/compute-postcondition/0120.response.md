The code assigns the value 0 to `nn[j]`, where `j` is 2. Since `nn[1]` is already assigned the value 0, the impact of this code is that it assigns 0 to `nn[2]`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `j`, and `nn[1]`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `nn[1]` is 0, and `nn[2]` is now assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `nn[1]` is 0, `nn[2]` is 0**
