Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][n + 1]`. If `cell[d]` is true, then `core[3]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `cell[d]` is false, `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3, regardless of its previous value, thus `nn[d]` will be 3.***
