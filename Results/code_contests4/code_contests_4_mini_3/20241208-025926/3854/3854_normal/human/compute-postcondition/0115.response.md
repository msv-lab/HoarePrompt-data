Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `core[j]` is updated for all `j` in the range from 1 to `n` based on the conditions in the loop; `nn[j]` retains its value set to 0 for those `j` where `cell[d]` was false and `d` was 0; `cell[d]` is true for those `d` where `core[j]` was set to `i + 1`.**
