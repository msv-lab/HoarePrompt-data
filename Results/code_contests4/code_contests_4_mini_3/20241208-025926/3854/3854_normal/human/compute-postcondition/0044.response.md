The variable `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is 2, and `d` has been assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, and `cell`) do not change with this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is set to `n`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is set to `n`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2.**
