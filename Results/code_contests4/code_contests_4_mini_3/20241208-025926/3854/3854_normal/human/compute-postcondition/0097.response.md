The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, and then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by this line of code. The final state reflects the assignment to `nn[d]`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
