To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the code:

1. We know that `j` is initialized to 1.
2. The variable `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
3. The variable `ins` is indexed by `j`, which is 1, and `i`, which is `n + 1`.

The code `d = ins[j][i]` assigns the value of `ins[1][n + 1]` to the variable `d`. However, we do not have information about the content of the `ins` array or how it is structured. Thus, we cannot determine the exact value of `d`.

Given this, the output state will reflect that `d` is assigned a value from `ins[1][n + 1]`, but we cannot specify what that value is. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0, `j` is 1, `core[1]` is 0, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]`.**
