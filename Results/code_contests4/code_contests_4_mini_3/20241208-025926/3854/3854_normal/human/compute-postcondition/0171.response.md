According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 2. Additionally, since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
