Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]` which is not equal to 0. If `cell[d]` is true, then `core[1]` is `n + 2`. If `cell[d]` is false, then if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `nn[d]` is set to 1 and `core[1]` is `n + 2`, otherwise, `nn[d]` is updated to 1, `core[1]` is set to 0, and `cell[d]` remains false with `nn[d]` equal to 0.***
