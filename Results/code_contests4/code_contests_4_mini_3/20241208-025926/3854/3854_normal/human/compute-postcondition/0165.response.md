Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][n + 1]`. If `d` is not 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[3]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `d` is not 0 and `cell[d]` is false, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3. If `d` is 0, no changes are made to `core` or `nn`.***
