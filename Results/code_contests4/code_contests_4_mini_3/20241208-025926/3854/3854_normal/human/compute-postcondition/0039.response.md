According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is 1. This indicates that the loop has executed with `j` starting at 1. 

Since `i` is `n - 1`, it implies that `n` is indeed a positive integer and `j` can increment up to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be 2, and it must be ensured that `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.**
