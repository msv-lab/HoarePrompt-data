Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][n - 1]`. If `cell[d]` is True, then `core[j]` is assigned the value of `n`. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is not 0, then `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is set to `n`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2. If `nn[d]` was 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to 2.***
