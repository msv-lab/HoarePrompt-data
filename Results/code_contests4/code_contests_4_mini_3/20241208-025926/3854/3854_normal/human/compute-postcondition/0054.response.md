The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][n - 1]`, where `ins` is an array or list that holds values. The code `cell[d] = True` assigns `True` to the index `d` of the `cell` array. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][n - 1]`, and `cell[d]` is set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][n - 1]`, and `cell[d]` is set to `True.**
