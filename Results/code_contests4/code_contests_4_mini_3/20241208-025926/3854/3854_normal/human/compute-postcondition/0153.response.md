Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value `ins[2][n + 1]`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is True, then `core[2]` is assigned the value `n + 2`. If `cell[d]` is False, and `nn[d]` is not 0, then `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[2]` is `n + 2`, `core[nn[d]]` is `n + 2`, and `nn[d]` is set to 2. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. If `d` is equal to 0, no changes are made to the variables.***
