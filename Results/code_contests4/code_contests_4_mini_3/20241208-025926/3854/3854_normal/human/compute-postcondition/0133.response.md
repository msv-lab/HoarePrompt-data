To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer (let's denote it as `n`).
- `i` is `n + 1`, which means `i` is `n + 1`.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `core[1]` is 0.
- `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]`, and it is not equal to 0.
- `cell[d]` is True.
- `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.

Now, we evaluate the line of code:

```
core[j] = core[nn[d]] = i + 1
```

1. First, we determine `i + 1`:
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, then `i + 1` equals `n + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2`.

2. Next, we need to understand the assignment:
   - `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which is also equal to `i + 1` (or `n + 2`).

3. The effect of the assignment:
   - The value of `core[j]` (which is `core[1]` since `j` is 1) will now be `n + 2`.
   - The initial value of `core[1]` was 0, but after this assignment, `core[1]` becomes `n + 2`.

The other variables remain unaffected in this context. 

Therefore, the output state after executing the code will be:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all still 0.
- `j` remains 1.
- `core[1]` is now `n + 2`.
- `d` remains as previously assigned.
- `cell[d]` remains True.
- `nn[d]` remains not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all 0, `j` is 1, `core[1]` is `n + 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]`, `cell[d]` is True, `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.**
