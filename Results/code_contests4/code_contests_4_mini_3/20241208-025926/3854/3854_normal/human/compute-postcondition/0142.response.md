Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, and `j` is 1. If `core[j]` is 0, then `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n + 1]`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[1]` is set to `n + 2`. If `cell[d]` is false and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is set to 1 and `core[1]` is also set to `n + 2`. Otherwise, `nn[d]` is updated to 1, `core[1]` is set to 0, and `cell[d]` remains false with `nn[d]` equal to 0.***
