The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, specifically defined within the ranges 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100. Additionally, the function processes instructions for each of the `n` cores, where each core consists of `m` integers. Each integer `x_ij` represents either a write command to a memory cell (with values from 1 to k) or a do-nothing command (represented by 0). 

Since the function does not take parameters and works with defined constraints, its functionality revolves around these constraints and the processing of the instructions.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and processes predefined instructions from `n` cores, each with `m` integers representing memory commands, ensuring that values adhere to specified constraints.**
