The value of `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, `core[j]` becomes `n + 1`. The initial states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `core[j]` is equal to `n + 1`, `nn[j]` is set to 0 for all `j` in the range from 1 to `k`, the loop has executed the first time with `j` equal to 1, `core[j]` is equal to `n + 1`; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n]`, and `d` is not equal to 0; the value of `cell[d]` is true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `core[j]` is equal to `n + 1`, `nn[j]` is set to 0 for all `j` in the range from 1 to `k`, the loop has executed the first time with `j` equal to 1, `core[j]` is equal to `n + 1`; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][n]`, and `d` is not equal to 0; the value of `cell[d]` is true.**
