According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is `n - 1`, this does not directly influence the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, `j` will start at 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we don't need to adjust it. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
