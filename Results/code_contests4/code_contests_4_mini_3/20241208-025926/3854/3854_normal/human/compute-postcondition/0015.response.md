According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2; `nn[1]` is set to 0, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**
