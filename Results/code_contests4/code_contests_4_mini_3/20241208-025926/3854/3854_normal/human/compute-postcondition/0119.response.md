According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit of the loop defined by `k`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and we know that `k` is at least 1, meaning the loop has executed once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 to become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `k`, which implies that `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is at least 2, `j` is 2; `nn[1]` is assigned the value 0**
