The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which in turn is assigned the value `i + 1`. The variable `d` is derived from the value `ins[j][i]`, and since `j` is `n + 1`, we can say that `d` is dependent on `ins[n + 1][i]`. The values of `core`, `nn`, and `ins` are not provided, but we know that `core[j]` will take the value from `core[nn[d]]`, which is dependent on `d`. 

Since `n`, `j`, and `d` have specific relationships, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `j` is `n + 1`; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`; `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which is `i + 1`.**
