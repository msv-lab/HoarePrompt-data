The value of `d` is assigned from `ins[3][n + 1]`. The value of `j` is 3, so `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, and `d` is from `ins[3][n + 1]`. The state of `core[3]` is not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, `d` is from `ins[3][n + 1]`, and `nn[d]` is set to 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, `d` is from `ins[3][n + 1]`, and `nn[d]` is set to 3**.
