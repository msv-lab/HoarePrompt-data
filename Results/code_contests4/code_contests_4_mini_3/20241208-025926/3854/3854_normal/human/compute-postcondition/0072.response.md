According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, as `xrange(1, n + 1)` generates values starting from 1 up to and including `n`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, it is already ensured that `n > 0`. The variable `j` will start at 1 for the first iteration. The state of `nn[j]` is not relevant for the loop's execution since it only determines what happens within the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `n` is a positive integer (which is already given),
- `j` is 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `nn[j]` is set to 0 for all `j` in the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**.
