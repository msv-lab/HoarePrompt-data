The value of `nn[j]` is assigned to 0. The variable `j` is 2, so `nn[2]` is set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nn[1]` is 0, and `nn[2]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nn[1]` is 0, `nn[2]` is 0**
