Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, and `core[j]` is equal to `n + 1`. If `cell[d]` is true, then the value associated with `core[j]` remains `n + 1`. If `cell[d]` is false, and `nn[d]` was not equal to 0, then `cell[d]` is true, `nn[d]` is now equal to `j`, and `core[nn[d]]` is accessed. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` was equal to 0, `core[j]` is equal to 0, `cell[d]` is false, and `nn[d]` is updated to 1 if it was 0 prior to executing the if statement.***
