The function `func_8` accepts an integer `start`, an integer `step`, and a list of tuples `count`. It returns a range starting from `start` and extending to `start + step * count` with an interval of `step`. However, there is a critical error in the code: `count` is treated as an integer representing the number of tuples in the list, but it is passed as a list. Thus, the actual implementation will raise a `TypeError` when trying to multiply `step` by `count` since `count` is not an integer. The intended behavior is to use the length of the `count` list to determine the number of steps, which is not correctly implemented. Therefore, the function fails to execute as expected.
