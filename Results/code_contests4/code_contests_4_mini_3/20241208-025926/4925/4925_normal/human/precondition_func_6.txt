o is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is the number of vertices, and m (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)) is the number of edges with weight 1. Additionally, the following m lines contain pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i, representing the endpoints of the edges with weight 1.
