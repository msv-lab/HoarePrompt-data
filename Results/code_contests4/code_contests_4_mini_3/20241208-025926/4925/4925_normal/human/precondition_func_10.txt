l is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the endpoints of edges of weight 1 in an undirected complete graph, start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end <= len(l). The first element of l contains two integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/2, 100000).
