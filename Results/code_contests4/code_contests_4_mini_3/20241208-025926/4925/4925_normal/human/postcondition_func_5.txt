The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers derived from the input provided. The integers represent the endpoints of the edges in a graph. However, it does not handle any validation for the input format or values, which means it could potentially return an incorrect or malformed list if the input does not meet the expected criteria (e.g., non-integer inputs or exceeding the defined limits).
