f is a callable function representing the edges of a complete undirected graph, dim is a tuple containing two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5), followed by m pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) indicating the endpoints of the edges with weight 1, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
