The function accepts a list of tuples `l` and two non-negative integers `start` and `end`, returning a range object representing integers from `start` to `len(l) + end`. The function does not validate the values of `start` and `end`, so if `start` is greater than `len(l) + end`, the resulting range will be empty. Additionally, if `start` is negative or if `end` is negative, this may lead to unintended behavior, though Python will not raise an error.
