The function accepts a tuple `x`, which contains two integers representing the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`. It returns the modular inverse of `x` under a predefined modulo `MOD`. However, it does not check if `x` is valid for modular inversion, such as ensuring that `x` is not zero or does not lead to a division by zero error.
