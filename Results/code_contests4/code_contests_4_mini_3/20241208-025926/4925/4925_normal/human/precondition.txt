n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), m is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),100000)), and for each edge, a_i and b_i are integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) representing the endpoints of the edges with weight 1, with a_i ≠ b_i and no edge appearing twice in the input.
