x is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n is the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and m is the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2), 10^5)). Following this, there are m pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) representing the endpoints of the edges with weight 1, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
