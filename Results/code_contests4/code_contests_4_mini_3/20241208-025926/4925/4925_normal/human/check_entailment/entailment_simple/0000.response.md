Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Understanding of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: The program attempts to calculate the weight of a minimum spanning tree for a complete graph with specific edges assigned weight 1 and others implicitly weight 0. However, the logic used in the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the union-find algorithm necessary for determining the minimum spanning tree.

2. **Union-Find Implementation Issues**: The union operation in the `union` function has flaws. Specifically, it tries to merge two sets based on their ranks incorrectly:
   - The line `p[u] = v` is intended to link the roots of two sets, but it does not account for the rank properly, especially when `r[u] < r[v]`. The rank should be used to maintain a balanced tree in union-find, but the logic here is flawed.
   - The condition `if (r[u] == r[v])` increments the rank for one of the roots after merging, but the merging logic itself is incorrect, leading to incorrect relationships between nodes. 

3. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation `print(len(roots) - 1)` does not correctly derive the weight of the minimum spanning tree. The weight of the minimum spanning tree should be influenced by the number of edges of weight 1 that can be included in the MST, which is not adequately captured by simply counting the roots.

4. **Edge Cases**: In the case where `m = 0`, the output should be `0` since all edges are of weight 0, and thus the minimum spanning tree should also have a weight of `0`. The logic does not seem to handle this appropriately.

5. **Complexity and Constraints**: The algorithm's efficiency in terms of handling the maximum constraints (with `n` up to `10^5` and `m` up to `10^5`) is not guaranteed due to the improper union-find structure and its operations.

Overall, the program does not adhere to the requirements laid out in the problem description, particularly in correctly calculating the weight of the minimum spanning tree based on the provided edges with weights. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
