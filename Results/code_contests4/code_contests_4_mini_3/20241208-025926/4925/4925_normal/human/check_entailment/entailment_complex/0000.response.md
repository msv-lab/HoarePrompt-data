Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly compute the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) for the given complete graph with specified edge weights. 

Here's the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling Edge Weights**: The minimum spanning tree's weight is derived from the edges with weight 1. The code does not ensure that it only accounts for these edges when forming the MST. It incorrectly assumes that edges not included in the input (those with weight 0) can be treated as if they contribute to the MST's weight.

2. **Union-Find Logic**: The union-find structure implemented in the code is designed to group connected components, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple edges of weight 1 exist between vertices. The current union-find implementation does not guarantee that it will always find the minimum spanning tree correctly, particularly when the graph has many vertices and edges.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Components**: The program calculates the number of connected components but does not correctly translate this into the weight of the minimum spanning tree. The MST weight is expected to be `number of components - 1` only when all edges are of weight 0. The annotations indicate that the approach taken in the code does not cover scenarios where edges with weight 1 dominate the connections.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly address edge cases, such as when `m = 0`. According to the problem statement, when there are no edges, the MST weight should be 0, which the code handles correctly, but it fails to ensure that this logic is consistently applied when edges are present.

5. **Excessive Component Count**: The code's logic for counting components can lead to incorrect results if the vertices are not connected adequately by edges of weight 1. The final output of `len(roots) - 1` does not guarantee that the correct MST weight is being computed based on the actual edges defined.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, leading to an overall assessment of incorrectness.
