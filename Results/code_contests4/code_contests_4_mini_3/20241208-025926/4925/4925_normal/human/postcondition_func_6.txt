The function accepts a tuple `o` containing two integers (n, m) and returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the respective input value and the first element of the tuple `o` (n). It takes input from the user, which is split into individual values, and each of these values is added to `n`, not the entire tuple. The function does not handle cases where the input may not be valid integers or if there are no inputs provided, which could lead to errors.
