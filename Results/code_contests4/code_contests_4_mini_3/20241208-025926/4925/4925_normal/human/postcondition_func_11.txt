The function accepts an integer `n`, and it returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. This is done by calculating `2` raised to the power of the bit length of `(n - 1)`. The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1, returning 1, which is the expected smallest power of 2 in that case.
