n is an integer representing the number of vertices in a complete undirected weighted graph, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The input also includes m, the number of edges with weight 1, satisfying 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/2, 10^5), and for each of the m edges, two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) representing the endpoints of the edges.
