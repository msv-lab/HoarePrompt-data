The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `m` (a non-negative integer). It returns a list containing `n` elements, each being the result of calling `func_4()` exactly `n` times. The specific values of the elements in the list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_4()`, which is not defined in the provided code. There are no additional conditions or logic directly pertaining to `m` in the function's execution.
