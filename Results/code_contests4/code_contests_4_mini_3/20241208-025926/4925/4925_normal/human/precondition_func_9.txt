start is an integer representing the number of vertices (n) in the graph, step is an integer representing the number of edges of weight 1 (m) such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5), and count is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the endpoints of the edges of weight 1 (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i).
