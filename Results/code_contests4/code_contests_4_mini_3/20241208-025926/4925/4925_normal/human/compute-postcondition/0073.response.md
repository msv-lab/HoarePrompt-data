Functionality: ** The function processes a graph defined by `n` vertices and `m` edges, creating a union of connected components. It calculates the number of connected components in the graph and prints the count of these components minus one. The function does not accept parameters directly but relies on external function calls to initialize the graph structure. It assumes valid input ranges for `n` and `m`. If there are no edges, it will create a fully disconnected graph, resulting in `n-1` components. **
