According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 3**
