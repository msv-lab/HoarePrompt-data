The function `union(i, j)` is called with the current values of `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` are 0 and 1, respectively. The function may perform some operation involving these two variables, but since we don't have information about the specific implementation of `union`, we cannot determine how `i` and `j` will be affected after the call.

However, we know that the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged due to the lack of assignment or modification in the provided code snippet. The conditions indicate that `n` is greater than 0 and that for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1, but the `union` function does not interact with `n`, `i`, or `j` in a way that affects their values.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` after the call to `union`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
