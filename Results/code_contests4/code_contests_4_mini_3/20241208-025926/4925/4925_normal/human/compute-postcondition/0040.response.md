According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. This means `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
