According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2, as stated. The current state indicates that `i` is 2, which means the loop has already executed twice. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. 

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the minimum value for `n` to allow the loop to execute a third time is 3. Thus, we should adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
