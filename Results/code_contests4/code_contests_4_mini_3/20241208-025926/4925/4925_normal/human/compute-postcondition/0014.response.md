Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to the representative or root in the structure defined by `p`, and `vc` is equal to `v` after all iterations of the loop. After the loop, `vc` is equal to a value that points to `v`, and `p[vc]` is equal to `v`, indicating that `vc` has reached the representative of the structure.**
