Postcondition: ***`u` and `v` are assigned values returned from `find(u)` and `find(v)`, respectively, with `u` not equal to `v`. If `r[u]` equals `r[v]`, then `r[u]` is incremented by 1, leading to a contradiction as `p[u]` is assigned the value of `v`, which would violate the precondition that `u` is not equal to `v`.***
