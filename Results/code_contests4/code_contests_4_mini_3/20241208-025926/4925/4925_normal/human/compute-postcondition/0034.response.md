According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and we know that `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, since `i` will increment by 1 after the current iteration.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
