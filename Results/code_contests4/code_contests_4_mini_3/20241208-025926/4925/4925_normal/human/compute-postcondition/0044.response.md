The function `union(i, j)` is called with `i` being 1 and `j` being 3. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not directly modified by this function call, so the output state reflects the initial values of the variables. Since the function's behavior is not specified, we cannot determine any changes to `n`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
