The function `union(i, j)` typically modifies a data structure that manages disjoint sets. Given that `j` is not present in the set `sg[i]`, the union operation will add `j` to the set associated with `i`.

Since `n` is greater than 1, it does not affect the union operation directly. The initial values of `i` and `j` are both 1, and the operation will change the set `sg[i]` to include `j`.

Therefore, after executing the `union(i, j)` function, `j` will be added to the set `sg[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `j` is now present in the set `sg[i]`**
