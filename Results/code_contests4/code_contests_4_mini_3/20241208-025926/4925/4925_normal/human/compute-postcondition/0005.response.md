The code assigns the value of `y` to `x` and the value of `x % y` to `y`. Given that `x` is the new value `x % y` and `y` is the previous value of `x`, we can deduce the following:

- The new value of `x` becomes the previous value of `y`.
- The new value of `y` becomes the result of `previous value of x % previous value of y`.

Since `y` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we can assume that the previous value of `y` is non-zero.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the previous value of `y`, `y` is the result of `previous value of x % previous value of y`.

Output State: **`x` is the previous value of `y`; `y` is the result of `previous value of x % previous value of y`**
