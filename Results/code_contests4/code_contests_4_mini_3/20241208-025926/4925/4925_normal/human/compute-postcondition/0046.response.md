To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will execute `n` times, with the variable `j` taking values from `0` to `n-1`.
2. The variable `i` remains constant at `1` throughout the loop.
3. Each iteration checks if `j` is not in `sg[i]`, and if it is not, the `union(i, j)` operation is executed.
4. The presence of `j` in `sg[i]` may change after the union operation, but we cannot ascertain the exact contents of `sg[i]` without specific details about the union function and the initial state of `sg`.

After `n` executions, the following holds true:
- `n` is non-negative, and if it is `0`, the loop does not execute, leaving `sg[i]` unchanged.
- If `n` is greater than `0`, `j` will take all values from `0` to `n-1`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `n` is still a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `1`.
- `j` will have taken the last value `n-1` in the final iteration of the loop.
- The state of `sg[i]` may include all values from `0` to `n-1` depending on whether they were present before or added during the iterations.

Considering the analysis above, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and `sg[i]` contains all `j` values from `0` to `n - 1` that were not already present before the loop.**
