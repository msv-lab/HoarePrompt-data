According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 (to allow `j` to be 1 for the next iteration). After the current iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

State: **If `j` (which is 1) is not in `sg[0]`, then `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2.**
