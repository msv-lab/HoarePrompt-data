The code snippet `union(i, v)` suggests a function call, but it does not modify the values of `n` or `i` directly in the context provided. The variable `i` is still 2, and `n` remains a non-negative integer that is greater than 2 to allow the loop to execute a third time. Since the state of `n` and `i` does not change due to the function call, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2**
