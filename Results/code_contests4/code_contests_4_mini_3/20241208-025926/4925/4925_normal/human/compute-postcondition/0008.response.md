The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, constrained to the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5. `y` is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1, constrained to the range 0 ≤ y ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2), 10^5). The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns the value of `x`, since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `x` and `y`, and return the value of `x` when `y` is 0, which represents the GCD of `x` and `y` in that case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` and `y` and returns `x` when `y` is 0, which is the GCD of `x` and `y` in that case.**
