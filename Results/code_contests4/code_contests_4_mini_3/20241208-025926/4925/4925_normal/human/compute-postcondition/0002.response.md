The function `func_11` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. The parameter `x` is an integer that represents the number of vertices in the graph, constrained between 1 and 100,000 (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5). The parameter `r` is also an integer that represents the number of edges of weight 1, constrained between 0 and the minimum of (x(x-1)/2) and 100,000 (0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2), 10^5)). 

The function performs an integer division of `(x + r - 1)` by `r`, which is valid only when `r` is greater than 0. If `r` is equal to 0, the division is undefined. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_11` is to accept two integer parameters, `x` and `r`, and return the result of the integer division of `(x + r - 1)` by `r` when `r` is greater than 0. If `r` is 0, the function does not return a valid result due to division by zero. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` (the number of vertices) and `r` (the number of edges of weight 1), returns the result of the integer division of (x + r - 1) by r if r > 0; if r = 0, the division is undefined.**
