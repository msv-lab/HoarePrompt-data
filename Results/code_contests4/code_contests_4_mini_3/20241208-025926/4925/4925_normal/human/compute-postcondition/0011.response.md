The function `union` accepts two parameters: `u` and `v`. Both `u` and `v` are integers representing vertices in a graph. After executing the function body, the function does not return any value; it returns `None` implicitly. Therefore, the functionality of the function `union` is to accept two integer parameters `u` and `v`, which represent vertices in a graph, and it performs an operation without returning any value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters u and v, which are integers representing vertices in a graph, and it does not return any value (returns None).**
