The code `roots.add(find(i))` suggests that we are calling a function `find(i)` and adding its return value to a set or collection called `roots`. The value of `i` is currently 1, and this indicates that the loop has executed at least once, and `n` is greater than 0, allowing for the possibility of additional iterations if `n` is greater than 1.

Since the state of `roots` is not provided, we cannot determine its previous state, but we can ascertain that a new value will be added to it.

The output state will reflect that a value has been added to `roots` from the `find(i)` function, where `i` is 1. The specific impact on `roots` is that it now contains a new element resulting from the execution of `find(i)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and a value from `find(i)` has been added to `roots`.**
