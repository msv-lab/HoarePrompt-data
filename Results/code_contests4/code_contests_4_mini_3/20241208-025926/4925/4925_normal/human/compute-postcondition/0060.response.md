To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we must analyze the loop's code and the initial state provided.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a non-negative integer. The variable `i` is set to 2. Within the loop, for each value of `j` from 0 to `n-1`, a check is performed to see if `j` is not in `sg[i]`. If `j` is not in `sg[i]`, the `union(i, j)` function is called, which would modify the state in some way related to the union operation.

Since we know that `n` is 3, the loop will iterate for `j` values of 0, 1, and 2. After the third and final iteration, the last value for `j` will be 2 since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished would depend on whether `j` was found in `sg[i]` during any of those iterations. However, since the problem states "if `j` is not an element of `sg[i]`, then the union operation is performed with `i` and `j`", and does not specify the contents of `sg[i]`, we can conclude the following:

- `n` will remain 3.
- `i` will remain 2.
- The value of `j` will be 3 after the loop has finished executing, as it will take on values 0, 1, and 2 during the loop iterations.

Thus, the output state can be expressed as follows:

Output State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `sg[i]` remains unchanged with respect to its contents.**
