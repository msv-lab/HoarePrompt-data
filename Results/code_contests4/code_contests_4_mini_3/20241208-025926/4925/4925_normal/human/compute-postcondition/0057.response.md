According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 3 and `i` is 2, with `j` currently being 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` will be 3, and since `n` is also 3, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 3.

State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a fourth time `j` must be less than 3 and `j` is 3**
