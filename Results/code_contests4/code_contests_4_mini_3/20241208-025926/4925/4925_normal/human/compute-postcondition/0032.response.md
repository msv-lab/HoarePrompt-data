To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the loop and its conditions based on the initial state and the provided outputs.

1. The loop iterates `n` times, with `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
2. Within the loop, if `j` is not an element of `sg[i]`, the `union(i, j)` operation is executed.
3. After the loop has executed all its iterations:
   - If `n` is greater than `0`, `j` will take all values from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The `union` operation potentially modifies the state of `sg[i]` depending on the condition that `j` is not a member of `sg[i]`.

If `n` is `0`, the loop will not execute, and `i` remains `0` without any changes to `sg[i]`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final state depends on whether the loop was executed or not:

- If `n > 0`, `j` will have iterated through all integers from `0` to `n-1`, and `sg[i]` will include all `j` values that were not originally present.
- If `n = 0`, the loop does not execute and `sg[i]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `sg[i]` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` that were not originally in `sg[i]` if `n > 0`; otherwise, `sg[i]` remains unchanged.**
