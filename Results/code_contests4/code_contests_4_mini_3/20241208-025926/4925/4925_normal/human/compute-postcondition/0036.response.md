According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once, and since `i` is currently 1, this means the loop has executed once already. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 2. The state of `j` will be 1 at the start of the second iteration since it will have incremented after the first execution. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 1**
