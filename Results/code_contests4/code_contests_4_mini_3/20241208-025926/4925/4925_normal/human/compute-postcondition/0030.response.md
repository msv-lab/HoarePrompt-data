The `union(i, j)` function is called with the values of `i` and `j`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the function will attempt to perform a union operation involving these values. However, the specifics of how `union` affects the variables `n`, `i`, or `j` are not provided in the context. 

The variable `j` is changed to 2, while `i` remains 0. Assuming `union(i, j)` does not change the values of `i` or `j` based on the information given, the output state reflects the initial conditions and the values passed to the function without any further modification.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
