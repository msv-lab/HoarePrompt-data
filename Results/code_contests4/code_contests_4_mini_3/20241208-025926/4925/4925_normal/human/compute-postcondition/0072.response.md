The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates with predefined constraints where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1. Each edge is defined by two integers `a_i` and `b_i`, which represent the endpoints of the edge and must adhere to the constraints provided.

After executing the function body, the output is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, based on typical graph-related functions, it can be assumed that the function would return a result related to the graph, such as a representation of the graph, a traversal result, or a computed value like the shortest path, connectivity, etc. However, since the exact output is not detailed, we cannot define the functionality completely.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on a graph defined by integer constraints for vertices and edges, returning a result related to the graph.**
