Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph, respectively. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially zero, the function will return the value of `x` as the GCD. The function handles the case where `y` is zero correctly, but there are no explicit checks or handling for cases where `x` or `y` might be negative or exceed the specified bounds.**
