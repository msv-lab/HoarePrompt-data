According to the code, the for loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2 for the next iteration. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 (the next value of `i`). Therefore, the updated state will reflect that `i` is now 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
