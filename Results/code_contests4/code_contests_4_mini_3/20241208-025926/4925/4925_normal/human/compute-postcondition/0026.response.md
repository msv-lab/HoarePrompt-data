According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again as long as `j` remains less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
