The function `union(i, j)` is executed with `i` being 2 and `j` being 3. The specific behavior of `union` is not defined in the initial state, but since `j` is not less than 3, the loop condition for executing a fourth time is not satisfied. Therefore, no changes occur to the values of `n`, `i`, or `j`. The output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3 and no changes were made by the union function.**
