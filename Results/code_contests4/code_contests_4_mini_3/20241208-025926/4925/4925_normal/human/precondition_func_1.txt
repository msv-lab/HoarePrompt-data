n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), and the input consists of m pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i, indicating the endpoints of edges with weight 1.
