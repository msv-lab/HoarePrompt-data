To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and check if it correctly computes the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the described graph.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The graph is complete with `n` vertices, meaning every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
2. The edges can have weights of either 0 or 1. There are `m` edges that have a weight of 1.
3. The task is to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

### Key Points:
- If there are `m` edges with weight 1, we want to ensure that the algorithm correctly connects all vertices while minimizing the total weight.
- In a complete graph, if `m` is less than `n-1`, it is impossible to connect all vertices, and the minimum spanning tree cannot be formed.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program appears to use a union-find (disjoint-set) structure to manage the connected components of the graph, which is appropriate for this type of problem.
2. The function `func_1` reads inputs and builds the graph representation using a set to keep track of edges with weight 1.
3. The core logic of connecting components is present, but there are potential issues:
   - The program does not directly account for the case where the number of edges with weight 1 (`m`) is less than `n-1`. In such cases, it should recognize that a minimum spanning tree cannot be formed and return a weight that reflects this impossibility (e.g., -1 or some indication).
   - The logic used for unioning elements may not correctly ensure that all vertices are connected when `m` is not sufficient.

### Test Cases to Consider:
1. **Case with no edges**: 
   - Input: `n = 3, m = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0` (the weight of the MST is 0 if there are no edges of weight 1).
   
2. **Case with insufficient edges**:
   - Input: `n = 3, m = 1` (only one edge with weight 1).
   - Expected Output: Should indicate that a spanning tree cannot be formed, but the current program may incorrectly calculate this.

3. **Case with maximum edges**:
   - Input: `n = 5, m = 10` (this is a complete graph with multiple edges having weight 1).
   - Expected Output: Should correctly compute the minimum spanning tree weight based on the provided edges.

4. **Case where all edges are of weight 0**:
   - Input: `n = 4, m = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0` as all edges are of weight 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for the program to fail in handling cases where the number of edges with weight 1 is insufficient to connect all vertices, we find that the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
