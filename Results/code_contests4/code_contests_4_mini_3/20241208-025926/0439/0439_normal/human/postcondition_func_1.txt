The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, representing a position in a grid. It returns a list of tuples containing the coordinates of all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are within the bounds of the grid and contain the character '#'. If no adjacent cells meet these criteria, it returns an empty list.
