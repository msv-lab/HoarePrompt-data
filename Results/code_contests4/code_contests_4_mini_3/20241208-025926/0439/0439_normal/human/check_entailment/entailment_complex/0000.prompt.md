You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monopole magnet is a magnet that only has one pole, either north or south. They don't actually exist since real magnets have two poles, but this is a programming contest problem, so we don't care.

There is an n× m grid. Initially, you may place some north magnets and some south magnets into the cells. You are allowed to place as many magnets as you like, even multiple in the same cell.

An operation is performed as follows. Choose a north magnet and a south magnet to activate. If they are in the same row or the same column and they occupy different cells, then the north magnet moves one unit closer to the south magnet. Otherwise, if they occupy the same cell or do not share a row or column, then nothing changes. Note that the south magnets are immovable.

Each cell of the grid is colored black or white. Let's consider ways to place magnets in the cells so that the following conditions are met.

  1. There is at least one south magnet in every row and every column. 
  2. If a cell is colored black, then it is possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 
  3. If a cell is colored white, then it is impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 



Determine if it is possible to place magnets such that these conditions are met. If it is possible, find the minimum number of north magnets required (there are no requirements on the number of south magnets).

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.

The next n lines describe the coloring. The i-th of these lines contains a string of length m, where the j-th character denotes the color of the cell in row i and column j. The characters "#" and "." represent black and white, respectively. It is guaranteed, that the string will not contain any other characters.

Output

Output a single integer, the minimum possible number of north magnets required.

If there is no placement of magnets that satisfies all conditions, print a single integer -1.

Note

In the first test, here is an example placement of magnets:

<image>

In the second test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are three example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 3 since we can move the north magnet down onto a white square. The second example violates rule 2 since we cannot move the north magnet to the bottom-left black square by any sequence of operations. The third example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first column.

<image>

In the third test, here is an example placement of magnets. We can show that there is no required placement of magnets with fewer north magnets.

<image>

In the fourth test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are two example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first row. The second example violates rules 1 and 3 since there is no south magnet in the second row and we can move the north magnet up one unit onto a white square.

<image>

In the fifth test, we can put the south magnet in each cell and no north magnets. Because there are no black cells, it will be a correct placement.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and grid is a list of n strings, each of length m consisting of characters '#' and '.' representing the colors black and white respectively.
def func_1(n, m, grid):
    components, visited = 0, [([False] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not visited[i][j] and grid[i][j] == '#':
                components += dfs(i, j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `visited` is a list of `n` lists each containing `m` boolean values indicating whether each cell has been visited, `components` is the total number of connected components found in the grid, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0 (indicating the completion of all iterations through the grid).
    return components
    #The program returns the total number of connected components found in the grid, denoted by 'components'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a grid, and a list of `n` strings, where each string consists of characters '#' and '.' representing black and white cells, respectively. It counts and returns the total number of connected components of '#' cells in the grid. Each connected component is formed by adjacent '#' cells (horizontally or vertically). The function does not handle cases where `grid` contains non-string elements or where the strings are not of length `m`. Additionally, it assumes that the input parameters `n` and `m` are within the specified bounds (1 to 1000).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the next n lines contain strings of length m consisting only of the characters '#' (black) and '.' (white).
def get_adj(i, j):
    adj = [(i + 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i - 1, j), (i, j - 1)]
    res = []
    for (ai, aj) in adj:
        if 0 <= ai < n and 0 <= aj < m and grid[ai][aj] == '#':
            res.append((ai, aj))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `adj` is a list of tuples, and `res` contains all tuples (ai, aj) where `0 <= ai < n`, `0 <= aj < m`, and `grid[ai][aj]` is '#'. If no positions satisfy the conditions, `res` is an empty list.
    return res
    #The program returns the list of tuples 'res' containing all positions (ai, aj) where 0 <= ai < n, 0 <= aj < m, and grid[ai][aj] is '#'. If no positions satisfy the conditions, 'res' is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, representing a position in a grid. It returns a list of tuples containing the coordinates of all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are within the bounds of the grid and contain the character '#'. If no adjacent cells meet these criteria, it returns an empty list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the next n lines contain strings of length m consisting of characters '#' and '.' representing black and white cells, respectively.
def dfs(i, j):
    component, stack = 1, [(i, j)]
    while stack:
        si, sj = stack[-1]
        
        if visited[si][sj]:
            stack.pop()
            continue
        else:
            visited[si][sj] = True

                if not visited[ai][aj]:
                    stack.append((ai, aj))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `stack` is empty, `component` is 1, all positions in `visited` corresponding to the original coordinates in `stack` have been marked as True, and `n` and `m` retain their initial values such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000.
    return component
    #The program returns the value of component which is 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, which represent coordinates in a grid of characters. It attempts to perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the position (i, j) in the grid, marking positions as visited. However, the implementation has a logical flaw as it returns a constant value of 1 for `component`, regardless of the actual size of the connected component found, which is not reflected in the return postcondition. Therefore, it does not accurately represent the number of connected cells found during the DFS traversal.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each of length m, where each character is either '#' (representing a black cell) or '.' (representing a white cell).
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    if (grid == [('.' * m) for _ in range(n)]) :
        func_3(0)
        return
        #The program returns None, as no value is specified after the return statement.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000; `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000; `grid` is a list containing `n` input strings, and `grid` is not equal to a list of `n` strings each consisting of `m` periods (i.e., `grid` contains at least one string that is not `m` periods long).
    for row in grid:
        start, stop = row.find('#'), row.rfind('#')
        
        if start == -1 or '.' in row[start:stop + 1]:
            func_3(-1)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000; if any row contains a '#' character, the substring from the first to the last occurrence of '#' does not contain the character '.', otherwise the function has returned None.
    grit = transpose(grid)
    for row in grit:
        start, stop = row.find('#'), row.rfind('#')
        
        if start == -1 or '.' in row[start:stop + 1]:
            func_3(-1)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000; if the loop completes all iterations without returning, it means that for every row in `grit`, the conditions for `start` and `stop` were met such that `start` is not -1 and there are no '.' characters in any of the substrings from `start` to `stop` for all rows.
    func_3(func_1(n, m, grid))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes a grid of characters represented as a list of strings. It checks if the grid consists entirely of white cells ('.') and calls `func_3(0)` if true. If any row contains black cells ('#'), it verifies that there are no white cells ('.') between the first and last occurrence of black cells in that row. It repeats this check for the transposed grid. If any of these conditions fail, it calls `func_3(-1)`. If all checks pass, it calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1(n, m, grid)`. The function ultimately returns None in all cases, as there are no return values specified.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the next n lines contain strings of length m consisting of characters '#' (black) and '.' (white).
def func_3():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is the separator value from kwargs, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least one element.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000. If the 'flush' key in kwargs is present and its value is True, then `file.flush()` is executed to flush the file buffer. If 'flush' is not present or its value is False, no action is taken regarding the file buffer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an unspecified number of positional arguments (args), along with keyword arguments (kwargs) that can specify a separator, a file to write to, an ending character, and a flush option. It writes the string representations of the positional arguments to the specified file, separated by the given separator, followed by the ending character. It also flushes the file buffer if the flush option is set to True. However, it does not process or validate the initial inputs n and m, nor does it handle any specific logic related to the '#' and '.' characters mentioned in the comments.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
