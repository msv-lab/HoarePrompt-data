The function accepts an unspecified number of positional arguments (args), along with keyword arguments (kwargs) that can specify a separator, a file to write to, an ending character, and a flush option. It writes the string representations of the positional arguments to the specified file, separated by the given separator, followed by the ending character. It also flushes the file buffer if the flush option is set to True. However, it does not process or validate the initial inputs n and m, nor does it handle any specific logic related to the '#' and '.' characters mentioned in the comments.
