Postcondition: ***`si` and `sj` remain as assigned from `stack`, `visited[si][sj]` is `True`, `component` is assigned the value 1. If `ai`, `aj` represent a valid adjacent position that has not been visited, the position `(ai, aj)` is added to `stack`, and `visited[ai][aj]` is marked as `True`. If `ai`, `aj` has already been visited, the state remains unchanged.***
