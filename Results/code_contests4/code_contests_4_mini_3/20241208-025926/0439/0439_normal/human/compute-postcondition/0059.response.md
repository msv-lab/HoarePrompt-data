The function `dfs` accepts two parameters, `i` and `j`. Both `i` and `j` are integers, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The function is designed to operate within a grid formed by n lines of strings, each string consisting of characters '#' and '.' representing black and white cells, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the value of `component`, which is 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `dfs` is to accept two integer parameters `i` and `j`, and return the integer value 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters i and j, both integers, and returns the value 1.**
