Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000; the function `func_3` is called with the result of `func_1(n, m, grid)` as an argument, and if the loop completes all iterations without returning, it confirms that `start` is not -1 and there are no '.' characters in any of the substrings from `start` to `stop` for all rows.**
