In this code snippet, the `stack` variable is being modified by appending a new tuple `(ai, aj)` to it. The values of `si`, `sj`, and `visited[si][sj]` are not directly impacted by this operation, but the state of `stack` changes. The condition mentioned indicates that `(ai, aj)` must be a valid adjacent position returned by `get_adj(si, sj)` that is not visited. Since we do not have the exact values of `ai` and `aj`, we can only state that they will be valid coordinates if they are appended.

The output state will reflect the change in `stack` rather than any other variable, as the other states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`stack` now includes the position (ai, aj), `visited[si][sj]` is `True`, `component` is 1**
