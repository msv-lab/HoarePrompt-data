The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the output file stream `file`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x`) remain unchanged after this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is the separator value from kwargs, `file` is the output file stream from kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args` and the value of `sep` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is the separator value from kwargs, `file` is the output file stream from kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, and the value of `sep` is written to `file`.**
