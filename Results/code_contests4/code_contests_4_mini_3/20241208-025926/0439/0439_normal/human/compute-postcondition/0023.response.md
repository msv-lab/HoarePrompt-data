The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the definition. Instead, it operates on input that is implicitly provided, which consists of `n` and `m` being integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, followed by `n` lines of strings, each of length `m`, containing characters '#' (black) and '.' (white). 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without any further details on what the function processes or returns based on the input, we cannot define a specific return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit inputs consisting of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) followed by n strings of length m composed of characters '#' and '.'. The specific processing and return value of the function are not described.**
