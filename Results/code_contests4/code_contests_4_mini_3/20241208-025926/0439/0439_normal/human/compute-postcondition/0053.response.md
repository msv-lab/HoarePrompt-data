The code `stack.append((ai, aj))` adds the tuple `(ai, aj)` to the list `stack`. The variables `si` and `sj` remain unchanged, and the `visited[si][sj]` is `True`, indicating that the position `(si, sj)` has already been visited. The variable `component` retains its value of 1. The values of `ai` and `aj` should represent a valid adjacent position that has not been visited, allowing the loop to continue execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `si` and `sj` remain as assigned from `stack`, `visited[si][sj]` is `True`, `component` is 1, and `(ai, aj)` is appended to `stack`.

Output State: **`si` and `sj` remain as assigned from `stack`, `visited[si][sj]` is `True`, `component` is 1, and `(ai, aj)` is appended to `stack`.**
