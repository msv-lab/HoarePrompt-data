Postcondition: ***`si` and `sj` are assigned values from the last position in `stack`. If the position `(si, sj)` has already been visited, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, leaving `si` and `sj` unchanged. Otherwise, `visited[si][sj]` is set to `True`, `component` is assigned the value 1, and all valid adjacent positions `(ai, aj)` that have not been visited are added to `stack`, with `visited[ai][aj]` marked as `True` for those positions.***
