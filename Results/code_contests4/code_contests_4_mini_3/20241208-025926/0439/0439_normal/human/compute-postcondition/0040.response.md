Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000; if the loop completes all iterations without returning, it means that for every row in `grit`, the conditions for `start` and `stop` were met such that `start` is not -1 and there are no '.' characters in any of the substrings from `start` to `stop` for all rows.**
