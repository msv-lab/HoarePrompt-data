According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `grit` list. If there are more rows in `grit`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `row` is the current row being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` needs to be the next row in the `grit` list.

Assuming `row` is the current row, we must also consider the index of `row` in the `grit` list. If `row` is the last row, `grit` must have more rows remaining for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, for the loop to execute one more time `grit` must have at least one more row after `row`.**
