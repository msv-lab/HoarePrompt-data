Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000; `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#' and `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in `row`. If `start` is -1 or if there is a '.' in the substring from `start` to `stop`, the program returns None. Otherwise, there is no specific return value provided.***
