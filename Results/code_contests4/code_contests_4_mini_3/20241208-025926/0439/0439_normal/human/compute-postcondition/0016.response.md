The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The previous state mentions that if a condition is met, the value of `sep` has been written to `file`, but this code does not alter the state of `sep`, `n`, or `m`. It only affects `file` by appending the string representation of `x` to it. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is the separator value from kwargs, `file` now contains the string representation of `x` appended to it, and `at_start` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is the separator value from kwargs, `file` now contains the string representation of `x` appended to it, and `at_start` is False.**
