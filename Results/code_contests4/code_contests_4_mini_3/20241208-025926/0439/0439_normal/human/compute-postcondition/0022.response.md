Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000. If the 'flush' key in kwargs is present and its value is True, then `file.flush()` is executed to flush the file buffer. If 'flush' is not present or its value is False, no action is taken regarding the file buffer.***
