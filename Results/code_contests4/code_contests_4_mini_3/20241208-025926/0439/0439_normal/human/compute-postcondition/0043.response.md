Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes a grid of characters represented as a list of strings. It checks if the grid consists entirely of white cells ('.') and calls `func_3(0)` if true. If any row contains black cells ('#'), it verifies that there are no white cells ('.') between the first and last occurrence of black cells in that row. It repeats this check for the transposed grid. If any of these conditions fail, it calls `func_3(-1)`. If all checks pass, it calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1(n, m, grid)`. The function ultimately returns None in all cases, as there are no return values specified. **
