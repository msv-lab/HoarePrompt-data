Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is the separator value from kwargs, `file` is the output file stream from kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, the value of `sep` is written to `file`.***
