The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a grid, and a list of `n` strings, where each string consists of characters '#' and '.' representing black and white cells, respectively. It counts and returns the total number of connected components of '#' cells in the grid. Each connected component is formed by adjacent '#' cells (horizontally or vertically). The function does not handle cases where `grid` contains non-string elements or where the strings are not of length `m`. Additionally, it assumes that the input parameters `n` and `m` are within the specified bounds (1 to 1000).
