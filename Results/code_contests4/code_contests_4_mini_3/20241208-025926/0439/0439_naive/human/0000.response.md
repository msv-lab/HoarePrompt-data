To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the code itself.

### Problem Requirements:
1. There must be at least one south magnet in every row and every column.
2. If a cell is black (`#`), it must be possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some operations.
3. If a cell is white (`.`), it must be impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some operations.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Grid Transposition**: The code transposes the grid using a lambda function. This allows checking column constraints similarly to row constraints.
2. **Finding Components**: The function `func_1` identifies connected components of black cells (`#`). It uses DFS to explore the grid.
3. **Checking Validity**: The code checks row-wise and column-wise whether the segments of black cells (`#`) are contiguous. If there are any white cells (`.`) between black cells in any row or column, it immediately returns `-1`, indicating an impossible configuration.
4. **Counting Components**: The total number of connected components of black cells is counted and returned as the minimum number of north magnets required.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. If there is only one row or one column and it contains both black and white cells, the program may not handle the case correctly where it needs to enforce the rule of south magnets in the same row or column.
2. The code checks for contiguous segments of black cells but does not seem to address cases where there may be isolated black cells that do not meet the placement criteria.

### Example Case to Test:
Consider a grid:
```
1 3
#..
...
```
In this grid:
- There is a black cell in the first row but no south magnets can be placed in the second row.
- The program does not explicitly ensure that a south magnet can be placed in every row and column.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not guarantee that there will be at least one south magnet in every row and column when there are black cells, and it fails in the outlined edge case, the program does not meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
