Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the rules outlined in the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Movement Restrictions at Poles**: The program does not enforce the restriction that Limak can only move South when at the North Pole and only North when at the South Pole. For example, if the input is:
   ```
   1
   10000 East
   ```
   Limak would try to move East from the North Pole, which is not allowed according to the description.

2. **Invalid Directions Handling**: The program ignores any movement that isn't North or South, effectively allowing Limak to make movements in invalid directions without any checks. This violates the requirement that he can only move North or South when at the poles.

3. **Final Position Check**: The program checks if Limak ends at the North Pole by ensuring `height == HEIGHT`, but if he moves incorrectly, it can result in invalid states before reaching the end. The final position check alone does not ensure that all moves were valid.

Therefore, due to the failure to enforce movement restrictions from the poles and the allowance of invalid movements, the program does not satisfy all conditions of the problem description.
