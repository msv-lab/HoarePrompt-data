You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move ti kilometers in the direction represented by a string diri that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:

  * If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South. 
  * If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North. 
  * The journey must end on the North Pole. 



Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer ti and a string diri (1 ≤ ti ≤ 106, <image>) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.

Output

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Examples

Input

5
7500 South
10000 East
3500 North
4444 West
4000 North


Output

YES


Input

2
15000 South
4000 East


Output

NO


Input

5
20000 South
1000 North
1000000 West
9000 North
10000 North


Output

YES


Input

3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North


Output

NO


Input

2
1000 North
1000 South


Output

NO


Input

4
50 South
50 North
15000 South
15000 North


Output

YES

Note

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole.
