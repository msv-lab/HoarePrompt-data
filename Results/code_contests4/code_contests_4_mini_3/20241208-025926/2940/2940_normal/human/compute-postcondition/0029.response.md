The code raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Invalid directon'. This indicates that the program encounters an invalid value for the variable `directon`, which is not 'South' or 'North'. The values of `n`, `i`, `dst`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 1, `dst` and `directon` have values based on the input, and a `ValueError` is raised due to an invalid `directon`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 1, `dst` and `directon` have values based on the input, and a `ValueError` is raised due to an invalid `directon.**
