The variable `height` is assigned the value of `HEIGHT`, which is 20000. The values of the other variables (`n`, `ti`, `diri`, `f`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `ti` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6; `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East"; `HEIGHT` is 20000; `f` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin`; `height` is 20000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `ti` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6; `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East"; `HEIGHT` is 20000; `f` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin`; `height` is 20000.**
