Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 0, `dst` is an integer from the line read from the file, and `height` is either less than 0 or greater than `HEIGHT`. If `directon` is 'South', then `height` has decreased by the integer value of `dst`. If `directon` is 'North', then `height` has increased by `int(dst)`. If `directon` is not 'South' or 'North', a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid directon'.***
