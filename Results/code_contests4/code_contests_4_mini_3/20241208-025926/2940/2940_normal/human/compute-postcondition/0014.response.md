The variable `height` is being incremented by the integer value of `dst`. The value of `dst` is not specified in the initial state, but it is derived from a line read from the file. The variables `n`, `i`, and `directon` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `height` due to the addition of `int(dst)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 0, `directon` is 'North', `height` is increased by `int(dst)`**
