Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 < `n` â‰¤ 50, `i` is 2, `sat` is False; if `directon` is 'South', then `height` is decreased by the integer value of `dst`. If `directon` is 'North', then `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst`. If `directon` is neither 'South' nor 'North', a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid directon'.***
