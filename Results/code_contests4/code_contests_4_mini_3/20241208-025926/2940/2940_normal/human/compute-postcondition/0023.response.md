According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again for the second time. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
