Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 0, and `dst` is an integer from the line read from the file. If `directon` is 'South', then `height` is decreased by the integer value of `dst`. If `directon` is 'North', then `height` is increased by `int(dst)`. If `directon` is not 'South' or 'North', a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid directon'.***
