Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 1, if `directon` is 'South', then `height` is decreased by `int(dst)`. If `directon` is 'North', then `height` is increased by `int(dst)`. If `directon` is neither 'South' nor 'North', a `ValueError` is raised due to an invalid `directon`.***
