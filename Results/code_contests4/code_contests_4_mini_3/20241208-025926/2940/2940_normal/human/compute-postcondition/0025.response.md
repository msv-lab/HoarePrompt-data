The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 1, `dst` and `directon` have values based on the input read from `f.readline()` after stripping whitespace and splitting by space, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
