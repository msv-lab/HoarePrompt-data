Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 0, `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the line read from the file. If `directon` is not in {'South', 'North'}, the execution skips to the next iteration of the loop. If `directon` is either 'South' or 'North', no actions are taken in this block.***
