To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the following aspects based on the given code and initial state:

1. The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is between 1 and 50.
2. During each iteration, the loop reads a value for `dst` and a direction (`directon`).
3. The loop only modifies the `height` variable when the direction is either "South" or "North":
   - If "South," `height` is decreased by the value of `dst`.
   - If "North," `height` is increased by the value of `dst`.
4. If `height` goes below 0 or exceeds `HEIGHT` (20000), `sat` is set to `False`, and the loop exits early.

After the loop has executed all iterations, we can summarize the state:
- `n` remains as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50.
- The final value of `height` depends on the cumulative effect of all "South" and "North" movements. It could either be within the range [0, 20000] or could fall outside this range, affecting `sat`.
- `sat` will be `True` if all height adjustments resulted in values within the specified range, and `False` if any adjustment caused `height` to fall below 0 or exceed 20000 at any point.

Thus, we conclude:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `height` is the final calculated height after all height adjustments based on the input directions, and `sat` is either True (if height is within [0, 20000]) or False (if height is less than 0 or greater than 20000).**
