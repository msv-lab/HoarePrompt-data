The variable `height` is decremented by the integer value of `dst`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `directon` are not directly affected by this operation. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `dst` or `height`, but we know that `dst` is an integer derived from the input and that `height` is also an integer. Therefore, the output state reflects that `height` has been reduced by the value of `dst`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 1, `height` is decreased by `int(dst)`, `directon` has values based on the input read from `f.readline()` after stripping whitespace and splitting by space.**
