The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since `i` is currently 0 and the other variables (`n`, `dst`, and `directon`) are not affected by this statement, the values of those variables remain unchanged. The program will just skip to the next iteration of the loop it is currently in.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 0, `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the line read from the file, and `directon` is not in {'South', 'North'}, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
