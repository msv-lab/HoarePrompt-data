The code `continue` does not alter the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop. Thus, the values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 < `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 2, `sat` is False; `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the line read from the file, split by space, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
