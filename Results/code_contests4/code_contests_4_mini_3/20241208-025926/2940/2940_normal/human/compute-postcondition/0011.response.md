The variable `height` is decremented by the integer value of `dst`, but the current value of `height` is unknown, and we do not have any information about `dst`. The variable `directon` has the value 'South', but it remains unaffected by this operation. Thus, we can only describe the change in `height` without specifying its final value. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `i` is 0, `dst` is an integer from the line read from the file, `directon` is 'South', and `height` is decreased by the integer value of `dst`.**
