Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from standard input, which specifies the number of height adjustments. It then processes `n` pairs of inputs consisting of a distance and a direction ("North" or "South"). The function adjusts a variable `height` accordingly, increasing it for "North" and decreasing it for "South". If the direction is neither "North" nor "South", it ignores that input. After processing all inputs, it checks if the final height is exactly 20000 and prints 'YES' if it is, or 'NO' if it is not. If at any point during the adjustments the height goes below 0 or above 20000, it immediately sets a flag to indicate failure and breaks the loop. The function does not return any value but prints the result.**
