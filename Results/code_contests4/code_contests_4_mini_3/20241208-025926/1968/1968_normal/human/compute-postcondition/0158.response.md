The value of `su` is reassigned to -1. The previous value of `su` was `sum(a[:md + 1]) + a[i]`, but this is overwritten. The variables `i`, `md`, and `n` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.

Output State: **`su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2**.
