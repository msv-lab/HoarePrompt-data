The variables `be`, `en`, and `ans` are assigned the values `0`, `n - 1`, and `n` respectively. The initial state indicates that `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from input. The assignment does not affect `out` or `a`, but it initializes `be`, `en`, and `ans` based on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignments made:

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input; `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n.**
