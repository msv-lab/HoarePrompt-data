The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables (`out`, `n`, `md`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables and the new value of `su`. 

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than `md + 2`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `i` is `md + 2`, `su` is -1**
