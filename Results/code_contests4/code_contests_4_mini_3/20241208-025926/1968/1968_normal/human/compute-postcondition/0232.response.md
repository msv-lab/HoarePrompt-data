To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `be <= en`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `su` can be either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`.
- If `su` is -1, then `be` is set to `md + 1`, and:
  - If the loop executed, `i` is `n`.
  - If the loop did not execute, `i` is `md + 1`.
- If `su` is the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, then:
  - `n` is greater than `md + 1`.
  - `i` is `n`.
  - `en` is `md - 1`.
  - `ans` is `md + 1`.

In both cases, we need to ensure that `be` is less than or equal to `en` for the loop to execute again. 

1. **When `su` is -1**:
   - If `be` is set to `md + 1`, then for the loop to execute again, we need `md + 1 <= en`. This means `en` must be at least `md + 1`.

2. **When `su` is the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`**:
   - Here, `en` is `md - 1`, and since `n` is greater than `md + 1`, we have `be <= md - 1`. For the loop to execute again, we need `be` to be less than or equal to `en`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states based on the conditions outlined above.

Since we don't know the specific values of `be` and `en`, we state the conditions necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`su` can be either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, and for the loop to execute again, we need `be` to be less than or equal to `en`.**
