According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `be` must be less than or equal to `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`, and `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need `be` to be less than or equal to `en`. Since `be` is `md + 1` and `en` is `md - 1`, we can see that `md + 1` is actually greater than `md - 1`, which means that the condition `be <= en` will not hold true unless we adjust the values.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `en`. Specifically, for the loop to execute again, `en` should be greater than or equal to `be`, which means `en` should be at least `md + 1`.

State: **`su` is either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, or the initial sum of `a` from the start to `md + 1`, `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `en` must be at least `md + 1`**.
