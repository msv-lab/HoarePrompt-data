According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. The loop will execute if the starting value of `i` (which is `md + 1`) is less than `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `md + 1` is less than `n`. 

Given that `md` is assigned the value `be + (en >> 1)` and `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`, we can deduce that the value of `md` must be such that `md + 1 < n`.

Before the loop starts, `su` does not directly influence whether the loop can execute, but `md` must be adjusted to ensure `md + 1 < n`. 

So, to summarize, for the loop to execute, we need to have:
1. `md` such that `md + 1 < n`.
2. The initial value of `i` will be `md + 1`.

State: **`su` is either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`, `md` is such that `md + 1 < n`, and `i` is `md + 1`**
