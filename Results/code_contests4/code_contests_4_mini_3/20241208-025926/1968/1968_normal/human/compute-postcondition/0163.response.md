The value of `su` is assigned `-1`, which updates its previous state of `su` being `-1 + a[i]`. The other variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is `-1`, `i` is `md + 3`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.

Output State: **`su` is -1, `i` is md + 3, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than md + 3.**
