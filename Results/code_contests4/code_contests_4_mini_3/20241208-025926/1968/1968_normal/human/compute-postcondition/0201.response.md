`be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The initial state indicates that `md` is an integer, but its specific value is not provided. Thus, `be` will be `md + 1`, but the exact numeric value cannot be determined without knowing `md`. The value of `su` and the list `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, `md` is an integer, `be` is `md + 1`.

Output State: **`su` is -1, `md` is an integer, `be` is `md + 1**
