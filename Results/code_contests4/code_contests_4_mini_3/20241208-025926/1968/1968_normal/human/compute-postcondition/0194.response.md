According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2`, and `n` is greater than `be + en >> 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being `md + 3`. Since `n` is still greater than `i`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than `be + en >> 1`, `i` is `md + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 3`**
