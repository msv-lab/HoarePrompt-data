The expression `be + en >> 1` computes the value of `md` using bitwise right shift. The right shift operation `>> 1` on `en` effectively divides `en` by 2. Therefore, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`. The values of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation, and we still have the conditions regarding `n`, `su`, and the loop execution. 

Since `be` and `en` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. Thus, the output state will reflect that `md` is assigned based on the values of `be` and `en`, along with the existing states of the other variables.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is either -1 or the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`**
