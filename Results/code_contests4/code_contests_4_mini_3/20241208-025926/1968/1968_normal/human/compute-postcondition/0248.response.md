The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `i` is `md + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
