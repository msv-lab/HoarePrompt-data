In this case, the code `su += a[i]` indicates that the value of `su` is being incremented by the value at index `i` of the array `a`. The previous state shows that `i` is equal to `md + 1`. Since `su` is initially -1, it will be updated to `su + a[md + 1]`.

However, since we do not have the specific values of `a` or `md`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `su`. The initial state also indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `su` is -1, but the increment operation is still performed.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `su` but does not provide an exact value because of the unknown values in the array `a` and the variable `md`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `be + en >> 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is updated to `su + a[md + 1]` (where `su` was initially -1), and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
