The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than `md + 2`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `i` is `md + 2`, `su` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
