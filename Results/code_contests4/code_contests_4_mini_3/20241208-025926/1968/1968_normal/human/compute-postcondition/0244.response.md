Postcondition: ***`su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, and `i` is `md + 2`. If `su` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking.***
