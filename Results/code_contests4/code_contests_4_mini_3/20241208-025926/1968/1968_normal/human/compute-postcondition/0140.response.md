Since `su` was initially -1 and `i` is now `n - 1`, we can calculate the updated value of `su`. 

1. `su` is updated to `su + a[i]`, where `a[i]` is the value from the array at index `i`. 
2. The new value of `su` becomes `-1 + a[n - 1]`.
3. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop.

Given that `su` is now `-1 + a[n - 1]`, we don't know if this new value is less than `a[i]` without knowing the value of `a[n - 1]`. 

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`su` is updated to `-1 + a[n - 1]`, and if `su` is less than `a[n - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop.**
