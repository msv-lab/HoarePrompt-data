Postcondition: ***`out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`. If `su` equals -1, then `md` is at least `n - 2`, `i` is `n`, and `be` is at least `n - 1`. If `su` is not -1, then `md` remains at least `n - 2`, `i` is still `n`, `en` is `md - 1`, and `ans` is at least `n - 1`.***
