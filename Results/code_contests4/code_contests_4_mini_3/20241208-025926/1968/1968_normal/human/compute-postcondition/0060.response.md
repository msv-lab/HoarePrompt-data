Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, where `su` is not equal to -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)` which is less than `n - 1`, and `i` is equal to `n` if the loop does not run or the last index iterated if it does run.***
