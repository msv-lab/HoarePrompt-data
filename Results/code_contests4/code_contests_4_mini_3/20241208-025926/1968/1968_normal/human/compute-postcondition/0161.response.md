The value of `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Initially, `su` is -1, and `i` is `md + 2`, so `su` becomes `-1 + a[i]`. The output state indicates that `su` has been updated, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is updated to `-1 + a[i]`, `i` is `md + 2`.

Output State: **`su` is updated to `-1 + a[i]`, `i` is `md + 2`**
