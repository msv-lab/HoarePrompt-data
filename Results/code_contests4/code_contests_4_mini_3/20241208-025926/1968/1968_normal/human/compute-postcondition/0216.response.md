The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. This assignment overwrites any previous value `su` might have held, which could have been either `-1` or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`. The other variables (`i` and the conditions regarding `n` and `md`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.

Output State: **`su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2.**
