According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2` and `n` is greater than `md + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `md + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.

State: **`su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `i` is `md + 3`, and `su` is updated to `su + a[i]`.**
