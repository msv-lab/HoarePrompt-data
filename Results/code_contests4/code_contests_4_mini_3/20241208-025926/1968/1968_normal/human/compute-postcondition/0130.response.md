Output State: **`out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is updated to `su + a[i]`, `md` is at most `n - 2`, `i` is `n`, `be` is at least `n - 1`, `en` is at least `n - 1`, and if `su` is less than `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
