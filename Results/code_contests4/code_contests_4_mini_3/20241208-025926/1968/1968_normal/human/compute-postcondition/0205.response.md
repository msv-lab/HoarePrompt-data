Postcondition: ***`su` is either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, or the initial sum of `a` from the start to `md + 1`. If `su` is -1, then `md` is an integer and `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. Otherwise, `su` is not equal to -1, `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, and `ans` is assigned the value `md + 1`.***
