Output State: **`su` is updated to `-1 + a[i]`, `i` is `md + 3`, and `su` is increased by `a[i]`. The new value of `su` will be `(-1 + a[i]) + a[i] = -1 + 2*a[i]`. If `-1 + 2*a[i]` is less than `a[i]`, the loop is exited; if `-1 + 2*a[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, the loop continues executing.**
