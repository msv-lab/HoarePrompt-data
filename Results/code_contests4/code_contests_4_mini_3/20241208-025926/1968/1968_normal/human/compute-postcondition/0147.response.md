Postcondition: ***`out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`. If `su` is -1, then `be` is now at most `n - 1` and `su` remains -1. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `su` is not equal to -1, `be` is at least `n - 1`, `en` is `md - 1`, and `ans` is `md + 1`.***
