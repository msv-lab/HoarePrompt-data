`su` is assigned the value of `-1`. The values of the other variables (`out`, `n`, `i`, and `a[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `md + 1` (which is `1` if `n` is at least `3`), and `su` is -1, which is now explicitly stated.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `md + 1` (which is `1` if `n` is at least `3`), and `su` is -1**.
