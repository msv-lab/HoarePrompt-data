The value of `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`. The other variables, `su` and `i`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is the sum of `sum(a[:md + 1]) + sum(a[md + 1:n])`, and `su` is not equal to -1; `i` is `n` if the loop completes or `i` is the first index checked after `md` if the loop breaks; `en` is `md - 1`.

Output State: **`su` is the sum of `sum(a[:md + 1]) + sum(a[md + 1:n])`, and `su` is not equal to -1; `i` is `n` if the loop completes or `i` is the first index checked after `md` if the loop breaks; `en` is `md - 1**
