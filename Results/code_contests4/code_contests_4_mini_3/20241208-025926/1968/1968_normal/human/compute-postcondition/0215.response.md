According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. The loop starts at `i = md + 1` and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 from its previous value in the last iteration. Since the loop is defined to run with `i` starting from `md + 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n` for it to execute again.

Given that `su` is either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, it doesn't directly affect the loop execution in this context, but we must remember that if `su` were -1 and less than `a[i]`, there would be a break in the loop, affecting the continuation. However, if `su` is not less than `a[i]`, the loop continues unaffected in this regard.

If `i` was at `md + 1` in the previous iteration, after the iteration it would now be `md + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, hence `i` should be `md + 2`, and we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `md + 2`.

State: **`su` is either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`**.
