According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to `md + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `md + 3`. 

State: **`su` is either -1 or updated to its previous value plus `a[i]`, `i` is `md + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 3**
