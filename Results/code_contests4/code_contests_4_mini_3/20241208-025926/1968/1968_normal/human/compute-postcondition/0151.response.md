According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `md` and `n`. The loop will execute if `md + 1` is less than `n`, meaning that `n` must be greater than `md + 1`. The state of `su` does not affect the execution of the loop, as it is calculated before the loop starts.

For the loop to be executed for the first time, `i` must start from `md + 1`, and it will iterate up to `n-1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `md + 1`.

State: **`su` is assigned the value of `sum(a[:md + 1])`, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than `md + 1`, and `i` is `md + 1`**
