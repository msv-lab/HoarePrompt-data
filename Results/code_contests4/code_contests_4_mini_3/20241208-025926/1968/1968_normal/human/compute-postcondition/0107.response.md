The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `md` is at least `n - 2`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
