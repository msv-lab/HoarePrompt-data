The value of `su` is updated to `-1`. The previous value of `su` has changed from its original value (the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`) to `-1`, but the values of `md`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected in this specific code execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the current value of `su`.

Output State: **`su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `i` is `md + 3`**
