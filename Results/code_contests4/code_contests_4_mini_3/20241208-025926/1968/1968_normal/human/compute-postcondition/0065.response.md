The variable `md` is assigned the value of `be + en >> 1`. The expression `en >> 1` means `en` is right-shifted by 1, which is equivalent to integer division by 2. The value of `be` is added to this result. The specific values of `be` and `en` are not provided, but `md` is calculated based on their values. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`**
