The value of `su` is incremented by `a[i]`. Given that `i` is `md + 2`, the specific value of `a[i]` is accessed. However, since we don't have the specific value of `a[i]`, we cannot determine the exact increment to `su`. The program state indicates that `su` is being updated, but the exact value of `su` after the operation is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `be + en >> 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`, and `if su is -1 and less than a[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
