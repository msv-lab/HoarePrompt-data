According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is assigned the value of `md + 1`, and `md` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Since `i` is currently `md + 1`, we can infer that to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become `md + 2`. 

Additionally, since `n` is greater than 0 and was not modified during the previous iteration, it remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the adjusted states should reflect these changes:

State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is updated to `su + a[i]`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is assigned the value of `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n`.**
