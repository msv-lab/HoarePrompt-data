Output State: **`su` is either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`; `su` is increased by `a[i]` but if `su` was -1 and less than `a[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `su` is not less than `a[i]`, the execution continues without further changes to the variables.**
