The value of `su` is assigned the value `-1`. Since `su` was either `-1` or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, it is now explicitly set to `-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`, `md` is such that `md + 1 < n`, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is less than `a[i]`.

Output State: **`su` is -1, `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`, `md` is such that `md + 1 < n`, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is less than `a[i]**.
