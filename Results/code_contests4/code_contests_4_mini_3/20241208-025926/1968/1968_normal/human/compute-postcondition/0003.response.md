Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each `a[i]` (1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9); `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list of strings by calling `rstr` `n` times; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input.**
