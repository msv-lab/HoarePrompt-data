Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is -1, indicating that at least one element `a[i]` is greater than `su` during the iterations; `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)` which is less than `n - 1`, and `i` is equal to `n` if the loop does not run or the last index iterated if it does run.***
