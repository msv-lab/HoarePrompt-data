The value of `su` is assigned to -1. The other variables `out`, `n`, `md`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `i` is `md + 2`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `i` is `md + 2`.**
