The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous value of `su` was not specified, but it is now set to `-1`. The states of the other variables (`out`, `md`, `i`, and `a[i]`) are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `md` is at least `n - 2`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `md + 2` is less than `n`; `su` is -1.
