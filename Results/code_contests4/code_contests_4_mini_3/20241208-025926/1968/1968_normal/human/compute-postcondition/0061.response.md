The value of `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`. The value of `md` is previously defined as `be + (en // 2)`, which is less than `n - 1`. This means `md` is some valid index, and thus `en`, being `md - 1`, will also be a valid index less than `md`. The other variables `out`, `su`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `su` is not equal to -1, `md` is assigned `be + (en // 2)` which is less than `n - 1`, and `i` is equal to `n` if the loop does not run or the last index iterated if it does run; `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `su` is not equal to -1, `md` is assigned `be + (en // 2)` which is less than `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n` if the loop does not run or the last index iterated if it does run; `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`.**
