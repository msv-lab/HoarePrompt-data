According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the range defined in the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, if `i` is `md + 2`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `md + 3`.

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.

State: **`su` is updated to `-1 + a[i]`, `i` is `md + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 3`**
