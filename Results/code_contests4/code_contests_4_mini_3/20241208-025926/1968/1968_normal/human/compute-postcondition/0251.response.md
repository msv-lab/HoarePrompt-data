To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided conditions and initial state. 

The loop continues to iterate while `i` is within the range from `md + 1` to `n`. During each iteration, if `su` is found to be less than `a[i]`, `su` is set to -1, and the loop breaks. If that condition is not met, `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`. 

### Analysis:
1. If `su` remains greater than or equal to `a[i]` for all iterations, then `su` will accumulate the sum of `a[i]` for all indices from `md + 1` to `n - 1`.
2. If `su` is less than `a[i]` at any point, `su` will be set to -1, and the loop will terminate immediately.

### Output States:
- If the loop does not execute (when `n` is less than or equal to `md + 1`), `su` will remain as the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`.
- If the loop executes and `su` becomes -1, this indicates that at least one element `a[i]` was greater than `su`.
- If the loop successfully accumulates all applicable `a[i]`, `su` will be updated to reflect the total sum of those elements.

Given these considerations, the output state after all iterations of the loop will conclude as follows:

Output State: **`su` is either the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1` plus the elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1` (if `su` is not set to -1) or `su` is -1 (if any `a[i]` was greater than the initial `su`). `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `n` is the total number of elements in `a`.**
