The value of `su` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is `md + 3` and `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `a[i]` is accessed. The previous value of `su` is not specified, but it is being added to the value of `a[i]`. 

If the new value of `su` after addition is less than `a[i]`, then `su` would be set to -1, indicating a specific condition. However, the problem does not provide the values needed to determine if this condition occurs, so we only know that `su` is being updated.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `i` is `md + 3`, and `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `i` is `md + 3`, and `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`**
