Postcondition: ***`su` can be either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`. If `su` is -1, then `be` is set to `md + 1`, and `i` is `n` if the loop executed; otherwise, `i` is `md + 1` if the loop did not execute. If `su` is the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, then `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n`, `en` is `md - 1`, and `ans` is `md + 1`.***
