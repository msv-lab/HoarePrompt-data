According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `be` is less than or equal to `en`. Right before the loop, `be` is 0 and `en` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least one time, `be` must be less than or equal to `en`. Since `be` is 0 and `en` is `n - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is the input value, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
