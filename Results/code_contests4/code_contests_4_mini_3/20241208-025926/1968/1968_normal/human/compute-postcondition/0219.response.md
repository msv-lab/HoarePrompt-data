The value of `su` is incremented by `a[i]`. The previous value of `su` can either be -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`. Since the condition states that if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop, we need to consider this condition.

If `su` was originally -1, it could remain -1 after the operation since adding `a[i]` does not change that it is less than `a[i]`. If `su` was the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, we need to add `a[i]` to it. However, if `su` was previously less than `a[i]`, it would have been set to -1 and we would not execute this code.

Thus, the output state needs to reflect that `su` is either updated or remains -1 based on the prior condition.

Output State: **`su` is either -1 or updated to its previous value plus `a[i]`, and `i` is `md + 2`.**
