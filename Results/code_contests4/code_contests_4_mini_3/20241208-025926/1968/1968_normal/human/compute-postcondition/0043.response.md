The value of `su` is assigned to -1. The previous value of `su` was the sum of `a[:md + 1]`, but now it is explicitly set to -1. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is assigned the value of `md + 1`, and `su` (now -1) is still less than `a[i]`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is assigned the value of `md + 1`, and `su` is less than `a[i]**.
