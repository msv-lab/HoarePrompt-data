Postcondition: ***`su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, and `i` is `md + 3`, resulting in a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
