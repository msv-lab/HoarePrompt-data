The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous state of `su` before the assignment is not mentioned, but since it is being updated to `-1`, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `md` is at most `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 1`, `be` is at least `n - 1`, `en` is at least `n - 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`.
