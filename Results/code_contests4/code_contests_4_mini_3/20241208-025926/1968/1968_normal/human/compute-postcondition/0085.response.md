The variable `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The value of `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, but since `be` is derived from `md + 1`, it creates a circular dependency. However, since `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `be` will be greater than `md`, leading to a potential issue in determining concrete values. 

Since `md` itself is not explicitly defined in terms of a fixed number in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `be`. Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship without providing explicit values.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `su` is either `-1` or the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` added to the initial `su`, `su` is equal to -1, and `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`.**
