According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i`, which starts from `md + 1`, and the upper limit is `n`. For the loop to execute, `md + 1` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `md + 1`. 

Given that `md` is calculated as `be + en >> 1`, we can express the condition more clearly: 

1. `md + 1` must be less than `n`, which implies `n > be + en >> 1`.
2. The initial value of `i` will be `md + 1`.

So, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`n` is greater than `be + en >> 1`, `i` is `md + 1`**
