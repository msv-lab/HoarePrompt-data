According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2`, and `n` is greater than `md + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `md + 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.

State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `i` is `md + 3`, and `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`**
