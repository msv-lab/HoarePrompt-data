The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the given initial state, which includes `out`, `n`, `md`, `i`, and the loop conditions. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `su` while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is assigned the value of `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n.**
