The value of `su` is assigned to -1, which changes its previous value from `sum(a[:md + 1])` to -1. This does not affect `n`, `i`, or `a[i]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is -1, and `su` is less than `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is -1, and `su` is less than `a[i]**
