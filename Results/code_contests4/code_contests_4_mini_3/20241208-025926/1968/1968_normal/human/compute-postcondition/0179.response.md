The variables `be`, `en`, and `ans` are assigned values based on the initial state. Here, `be` is initialized to 0, `en` is initialized to `n - 1`, and `ans` is initialized to `n`. The value of `n` is the input value provided at the start, while `a` remains unaffected in this step.

Therefore, after the assignment:
- `be` is 0
- `en` is `n - 1`
- `ans` is `n`

Output State: **`n` is the input value, `a` is the sorted list of input values, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n**
