The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en // 2)`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is assigned the value of `md + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
