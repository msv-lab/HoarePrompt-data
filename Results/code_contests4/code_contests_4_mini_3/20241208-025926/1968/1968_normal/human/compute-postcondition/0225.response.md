To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the code provided.

1. The loop iterates over the range from `md + 1` to `n`. This means it will execute as long as `n` is greater than `md + 1`.
2. Inside the loop, if `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su` will be set to -1 and the loop will break immediately.
3. If the loop does not break, `su` will accumulate the values of `a[i]` for each iteration.

Based on these points, we can determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop:

- If the loop executes and never breaks, `su` will be the sum of all `a[i]` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`.
- If the loop executes but breaks, `su` will be -1.
- If `n` is less than or equal to `md + 1`, the loop will not execute, and `su` will retain its initial value.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be as follows:

Output State: **`su` is either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1; n` is greater than `md + 1 if the loop executed; `i` is `n` if the loop executed, otherwise `i` is `md + 1` if the loop did not execute.**
