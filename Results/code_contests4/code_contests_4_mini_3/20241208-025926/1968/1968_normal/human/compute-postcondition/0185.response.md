The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous value of `su` is not provided, but it is indicated that `su` is less than `a[i]`. This means the new value of `su` does not affect any other variables or conditions based on the given information. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `su` remain unchanged in their respective states except for `su`, which is now `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `be + en >> 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is -1**
