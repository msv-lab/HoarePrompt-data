Postcondition: ***`su` is either -1 or a non-negative value. If `su` is -1, then `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1 and `be` is set to `md + 1`. If `su` is a non-negative value, then `su` represents the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1` plus the elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `su` is not equal to -1, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `en` is `md - 1`, and `ans` is `md + 1`.***
