According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 1`, and `n` is greater than `be + en >> 1`. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `md + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than `md + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than `be + en >> 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`**
