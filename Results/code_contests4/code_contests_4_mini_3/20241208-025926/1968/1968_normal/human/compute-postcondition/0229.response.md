The value of `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`. The initial state indicates that the variables `su`, `n`, and `i` are defined based on certain conditions involving a loop. However, the assignment of `en` does not affect any of these variables directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1` if the loop executed; `i` is `n` if the loop executed, otherwise `i` is `md + 1` if the loop did not execute; `en` is `md - 1`.

Output State: **`su` is the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1` if the loop executed; `i` is `n` if the loop executed, otherwise `i` is `md + 1` if the loop did not execute; `en` is `md - 1**
