The value of `su` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The previous value of `su` is -1, and since `i` is `n - 1`, we need to check the value of `a[n - 1]`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop, but we are not given the specific values of `a[i]` or `n`. Therefore, we can only state that `su` has been updated.

Output State: **`su` is updated to `su + a[i]`, where `su` was -1, and `a[i]` is `a[n - 1]`**
