Postcondition: ***`su` is -1, indicating that `su` was less than any `a[i]` during the loop. `su` could also be the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1 (if loop executed completely), or the initial sum of `a` from the start to `md + 1 (if loop did not execute). `a` is a list of integers, and `md` and `n` are integers.***
