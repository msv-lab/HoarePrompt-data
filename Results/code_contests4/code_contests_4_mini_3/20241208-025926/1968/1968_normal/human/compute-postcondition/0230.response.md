The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The initial state indicates that `su` is the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, and since `n` is greater than `md + 1`, it suggests that the loop executed, which means `i` is `n`. The value of `en` remains unchanged at `md - 1`. The execution of this line does not affect `su`, `i`, or `en`. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n`, `en` is `md - 1`, and `ans` is `md + 1`.

Output State: **`su` is the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n`, `en` is `md - 1`, `ans` is `md + 1`**.
