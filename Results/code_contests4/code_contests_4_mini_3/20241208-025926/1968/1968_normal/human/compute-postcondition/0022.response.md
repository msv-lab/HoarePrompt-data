The value of `su` is assigned -1. The previous value of `su` is -1, so it remains -1 after execution. The other variables, `out`, `n`, and `i`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `su` is -1.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `su` is -1**
