The variable `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. Since `md` is previously defined as `be + (en // 2)`, we can rearrange this to find the new value of `be`. However, we do not have the specific value of `md` or `be`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is -1, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `i` is equal to `n` or the last index iterated.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is -1, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `i` is equal to `n` or the last index iterated.**
