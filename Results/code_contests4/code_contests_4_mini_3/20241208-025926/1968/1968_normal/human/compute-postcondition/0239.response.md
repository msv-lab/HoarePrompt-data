Postcondition: ***`su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, and `i` is `md + 1`. If `su` is -1 and is less than the element at index `i` of list `a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
