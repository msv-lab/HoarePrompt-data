The variable `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, which affects how many elements from the list `a` are summed. The variable `su` is assigned the sum of the elements in `a` from the beginning up to index `md + 1`. The previous value of `su` can be either -1 or the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, but this does not affect the assignment of `su`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment.

Output State: **`su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1.**
