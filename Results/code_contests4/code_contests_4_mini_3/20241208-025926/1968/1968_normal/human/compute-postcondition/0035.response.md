The variable `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`, but the previous values of `md` and `en` are not provided. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is either -1 or the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1] (and not equal to -1); `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `su` is either -1 or the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1], `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1**
