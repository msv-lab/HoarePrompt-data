The variables `be`, `en`, and `ans` are assigned new values. Specifically, `be` is set to 0, `en` is set to `n - 1`, and `ans` is set to `n`. The other variables `out` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of input integers; `be` is 0; `en` is `n - 1`; `ans` is `n`.

Output State: **`out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of input integers; `be` is 0; `en` is `n - 1`; `ans` is `n`**
