Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, if `su` is -1, then `md` is less than `n - 1` and `i` is equal to `n` or the last index iterated. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `su` is not equal to -1, `md` is assigned `be + (en // 2)` which is less than `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n` if the loop does not run or the last index iterated if it does run; `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`, `ans` is `md + 1`.***
