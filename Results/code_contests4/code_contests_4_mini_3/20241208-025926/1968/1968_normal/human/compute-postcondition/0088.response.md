The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. Since `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, this means that `ans` will be `be + (en // 2) + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `su` is not equal to -1, `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, and `ans` is `md + 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `su` is not equal to -1, `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, and `ans` is `md + 1`.**
