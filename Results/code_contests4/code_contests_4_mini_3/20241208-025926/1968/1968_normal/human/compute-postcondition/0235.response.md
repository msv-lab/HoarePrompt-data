According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the value of `md + 1` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `md + 1` must be less than `n`. Since `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, we need to ensure that `md + 1 < n`, which means `be + en < n + 1`. 

To summarize the states:
- `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`.
- `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, so we need to compute this value.
- `i` should start from `md + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than `md + 1`, and `i` is initialized to `md + 1`.

State: **`su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than `md + 1`, and `i` is `md + 1`**
