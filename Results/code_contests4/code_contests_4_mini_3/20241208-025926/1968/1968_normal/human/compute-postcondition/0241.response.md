According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i = md + 1` and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 1`, and since `n` is greater than `md + 1`, the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `md + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `md + 2`.

State: **`su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is updated to `su + a[i]`**
