The value of `su` is assigned to -1. This means that the previous value of `su` (which was the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`) is now replaced with -1. The values of `out`, `n`, `md`, `i`, and the elements of `a` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `su` is -1, and the loop conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `su` is -1, and the loop conditions remain unchanged.**
