The value of `su` is incremented by `a[i]`. The previous value of `su` is -1, so after execution, `su` becomes `-1 + a[i]`. The other variables (`out`, `n`, `md`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `su` is now `-1 + a[i]`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `md` is calculated as `be + (en // 2)`, `su` is now `-1 + a[i]`**.
