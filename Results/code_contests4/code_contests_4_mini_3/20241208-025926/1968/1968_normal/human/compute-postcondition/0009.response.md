According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided to `int(input())`. The loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer value obtained from the input. Since `out` is an empty list and `ceil1` is a function, they do not affect the execution of the loop directly. However, for the loop to execute at least once, the input must be at least 1.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the input must be such that it converts to an integer greater than 0.

State: **`out` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time the input must be greater than 0**
