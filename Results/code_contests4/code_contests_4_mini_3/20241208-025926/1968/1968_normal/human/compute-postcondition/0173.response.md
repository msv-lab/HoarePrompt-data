Postcondition: ***`su` is either -1 or the sum of `sum(a[:md + 1]) + sum(a[md + 1:n])`. If `su` is -1, `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`, and `i` is `n` if the loop completes, or the first index checked after `md` if the loop breaks. If `su` is the sum of `sum(a[:md + 1]) + sum(a[md + 1:n])`, `en` is `md - 1`, `ans` is `md + 1`, and `i` is `n` if the loop completes or the first index checked after `md` if the loop breaks.***
