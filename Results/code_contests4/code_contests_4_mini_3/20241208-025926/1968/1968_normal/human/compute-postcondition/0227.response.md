The variable `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The value of `md` is not provided in the initial state, but we know that `be` will take on the value of `md + 1`. The other variables `su` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1; `su` can also be the sum of `a` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`; `n` is greater than `md + 1` if the loop executed; `i` is `n` if the loop executed, otherwise `i` is `md + 1` if the loop did not execute; `be` is `md + 1`.
