The variable `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. Given that `md` is at least `n - 2`, `be` will be at least `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an updated list with a new element which is a string of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `md` is at least `n - 2`, `i` is `n`, `su` is -1, and `be` is at least `n - 1`.
