The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It processes these cases to determine the largest index such that the sum of the selected integers is less than or equal to the next integer in the sorted list. The function outputs the count of integers that can be included based on this condition and their respective indices in the original list. It handles up to 10,000 test cases and each list can contain up to 200,000 integers, with integers ranging from 1 to 10^9.
