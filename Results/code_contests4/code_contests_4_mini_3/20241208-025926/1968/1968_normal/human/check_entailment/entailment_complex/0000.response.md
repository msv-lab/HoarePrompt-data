To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
The program must identify players who have a non-zero probability of winning a championship based on their tokens. The key points from the description are:
1. Players play against each other in a series of games.
2. The winner takes all tokens from the loser.
3. The last player remaining with tokens is the winner.
4. We need to output the number of players who can potentially win and their indices.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases, correctly handling up to 10,000 cases with each case containing up to 200,000 players.
2. **Sorting Tokens**: The program sorts the list of tokens, which is a necessary step because the game dynamics depend on comparing the number of tokens between players.
3. **Binary Search Logic**: The program uses a binary search approach (`while be <= en`) to find the largest index `md` such that the sum of tokens of players up to that index is less than or equal to the next player's tokens. This logic is crucial because it effectively determines how many players could potentially win based on their token count.
4. **Output Generation**: The function constructs the output by counting the eligible players and storing their original indices.

### Correctness Check:
- The program's logic correctly identifies the players who have a non-zero probability of winning based on the token sums and the game's rules. 
- The condition checked in the binary search (`if su < a[i]`) ensures that only players who can potentially win (i.e., have enough tokens to defeat others) are considered.
- The final output includes both the count of such players and their corresponding indices.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program's logic and comparing it with the problem description, we find that the program accurately implements the required functionality. It correctly identifies the players who can win based on the rules specified.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
