Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the BMI according to the formula provided in the problem description. The BMI should be calculated as `weight / (height ** 2)`, which the program attempts to implement. However, the condition to check for obesity (`25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) ** 2`) is incorrectly written. 

To illustrate the problem, consider a case where a student's height is extremely small, but their weight is also small. For instance:

Input:
```
1006,50.0,1.0
```

For this input, the BMI calculation would be:
- BMI = 50.0 / (1.0 ** 2) = 50.0

In this case, since 50.0 is greater than 25, the program would correctly print the student ID `1006`. However, if we had another student with a height of 1.5 meters and a weight of 37.5 kg:

Input:
```
1007,37.5,1.5
```

Here, the BMI would be:
- BMI = 37.5 / (1.5 ** 2) = 16.67

In this case, the program would not print `1007`, which is correct since the BMI is below 25, but it only handles this case correctly due to the logic of the BMI condition.

However, if the input was formatted improperly, such as:
```
1008,70.0,0.0
```
This would cause a division by zero error, which the program does not handle. This indicates that the program is not robust against potential input errors as stated in the problem description.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and can fail with the given input conditions.
