Functionality: ** The function processes input lines containing student IDs, weights, and heights, and prints the student IDs for which the Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated as weight divided by the square of height is greater than or equal to 25.0. The function does not accept parameters or return any values. It does not handle cases where the input format may be incorrect or where the weight or height might not be convertible to float, potentially leading to runtime errors. **
