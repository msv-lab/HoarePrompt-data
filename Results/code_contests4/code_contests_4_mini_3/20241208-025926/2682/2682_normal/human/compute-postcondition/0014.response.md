The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined with empty parentheses. Instead, it processes input consisting of multiple lines, where each line contains a student ID, weight, and height in a specific format. After processing this input, the function likely performs calculations or evaluations based on the provided data.

However, since there is no explicit output behavior outlined in the provided constraints, we cannot determine specific return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function is centered around handling input data related to students.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple lines of input, each containing a student ID, weight, and height. It does not accept parameters directly and does not specify return values.**
