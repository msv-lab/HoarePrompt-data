Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the BMI calculation as specified in the problem description. The BMI formula is given by:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{(\text{height})^2} \]

The program attempts to calculate BMI with the expression `float(weight) / float(height) ** 2`, which is correct. However, the program lacks proper input handling and does not ensure that the input format is always correct. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Input Handling**: The program assumes that the input will always be in the correct format (i.e., three values separated by commas). If the format is incorrect or if the input contains non-numeric values, the program will raise runtime errors.
   
2. **Output Specification**: The problem description specifies that the output should be the student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher, printed on one line. The program, however, prints each qualifying student ID on a new line instead of all on one line.

3. **Lack of Return Value**: The function is not designed to return any value, which may be an implicit requirement based on typical programming practices for functions.

Thus, while the BMI calculation part of the program is conceptually correct, the implementation does not fully adhere to the problem description's requirements regarding formatting, output, and error handling.
