Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the BMI. The formula for BMI is:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2} \]

However, the program does not check whether the weight and height are provided correctly before performing the calculation, nor does it ensure that the height is not zero (which is not possible in the given constraints but should be considered for robustness). Additionally, the program does not handle input or output formatting according to the examples provided in the problem description.

In the case of the provided example:

Input:
```
1001,50.0,1.60
1002,60.0,1.70
1003,70.0,1.80
1004,80.0,1.70
1005,90.0,1.60
```

Expected Output:
```
1004
1005
```

The program will output student IDs for those with a BMI of 25 or higher, which it does correctly. However, it fails to gather all the results and print them on a single line, as required by the problem description. Instead, it prints each qualifying ID on a new line.

Since the output does not match the specified output format of the problem description, the program does not meet all requirements. Hence, it is deemed incorrect.
