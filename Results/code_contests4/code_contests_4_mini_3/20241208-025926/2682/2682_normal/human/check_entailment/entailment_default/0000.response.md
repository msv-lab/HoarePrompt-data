The provided program aims to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for students based on their weight and height, and it is supposed to print the student IDs of those with a BMI of 25 or higher. The BMI is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2} \]

### Initial Assessment of Code Against Problem Description
1. The code reads input lines where each line contains a student’s ID, weight, and height.
2. It splits the input into three parts: `number`, `weight`, and `height`.
3. It then checks if the calculated BMI is greater than or equal to 25 and prints the student ID if this condition is met.

### Edge Cases
1. **Input Format**: The program does not handle cases where the input format may be incorrect (e.g., missing values, non-numeric input for weight or height). This can lead to runtime errors, such as `ValueError` when converting to `float`.
2. **Height and Weight Limits**: The code does not check whether the height and weight values fall within the specified ranges (1 ≤ wi ≤ 200 and 1.0 ≤ hi ≤ 2.0). Although the problem states these limits, the program assumes that all inputs are valid, which may not be the case.

### Checking Output Hints
The output hints state that the function prints student IDs for which the BMI calculated as weight divided by the square of height is greater than or equal to 25.0 and that it does not handle incorrect input formats.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle incorrect input formats or validate the ranges of weight and height. Therefore, it can potentially crash or produce incorrect outputs if the input is not as expected. Given that it fails to meet the problem description for every potential case due to these issues:

Correctness: **False**. 

The code does not correctly handle scenarios of improper input and does not validate the input ranges for weight and height.
