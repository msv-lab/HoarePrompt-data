You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For a finite set of integers X, let f(X)=\max X - \min X.

Given are N integers A_1,...,A_N.

We will choose K of them and let S be the set of the integers chosen. If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.

Since the answer can be enormous, print it \bmod (10^9+7).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 10^5) where each integer A_i satisfies -10^9 <= A_i <= 10^9, and b is an integer K (1 <= K <= N).
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers of length N, `b` is an integer K, `c` is a list formed by appending K to `a`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is decreased by `mod`, which is less than or equal to the previous value of `c`.
    return c
    #The program returns the list 'c' formed by appending integer K to list 'a', which may have been decreased by mod if it was greater than or equal to mod
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`, and returns a new list formed by appending `b` to `a`. However, the code incorrectly attempts to add `b` to `a`, which will cause a TypeError because it is trying to concatenate an integer to a list directly. The intended functionality seems to be to return the list `a` with `b` appended to it without any modulus operation. The code does not correctly handle the addition of `b` to `a`, and thus the function will not work as expected.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000), and b is an integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ N). The absolute value of each integer in a is less than or equal to 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return (a - b) % mod
    #The program returns the result of subtracting integer b from the list a and then taking the modulus with respect to mod
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`, and it returns the result of subtracting `b` from the entire list `a` and taking the modulus with respect to an undefined variable `mod`. However, the code as written will result in a TypeError since it attempts to perform a subtraction operation between a list and an integer, which is not valid. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the described functionality, and it lacks proper handling for the modulus operation and the variable `mod`, which is not defined in the provided code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), and b is an integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ N). The absolute values of elements in a do not exceed 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the product of the list 'a' and the integer 'b', followed by taking that result modulo 'mod', where 'a' is a list of integers of length N and 'b' is an integer K.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`, calculates the product of the list `a` and the integer `b`, and returns the result modulo `mod`. However, the code does not handle edge cases such as when `mod` is not defined or when the product exceeds the limits of standard integer types without any specific error handling. Additionally, the product is computed as `a * b`, which does not align with the typical interpretation of multiplying all elements of the list `a` by `b` but is instead interpreted as a vector multiplication if `a` were a NumPy array. The function may not behave as intended if `a` is a list of integers, as Python does not support direct multiplication of lists in this manner.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 10^5), b is an integer K (1 <= K <= N), and the absolute value of each integer in a is at most 10^9.
def func_4(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 10^5), `b` is an integer K (1 <= K <= N), and the absolute value of each integer in `a` is at most 10^9. The value of `b` is not equal to 0.
    if (b % 2 == 1) :
        return func_3(a, func_4(a, b - 1))
        #The program returns the result of func_3 applied to list 'a' and the result of func_4 applied to list 'a' with the argument 'b - 1', where 'b' is an odd integer not equal to 0, and 'a' is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 10^5).
    else :
        temp = func_4(a, b / 2)
        return temp * temp
        #The program returns the square of the result from func_4 with the input list 'a' and the integer value 'b/2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It returns 1 if `b` is 0. If `b` is odd, it returns the result of `func_3` applied to list `a` and a recursive call to itself with `b - 1`. If `b` is even, it returns the square of the result from a recursive call to itself with `b / 2`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `b` is negative or non-integer values, which could lead to potential errors.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with the first two integers representing N (the total number of integers) and K (the number of integers to choose), followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N such that 1 <= N <= 100000, 1 <= K <= N, and |A_i| <= 10^9.
def func_5(a):
    return func_4(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of func_4 called with list 'a' and mod - 2, where 'a' contains the first two integers representing N and K, followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` where the first two integers represent `N` (the total number of integers) and `K` (the number of integers to choose). It returns the result of `func_4` when called with `a` and `mod` set to -2. The correctness of the result depends on the implementation of `func_4`, which is not provided here.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and fac is a list of integers where each integer A_i satisfies |A_i| <= 10^9.
def func_6(n, k, fac):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, regardless of the values of n, k, or fac, since the return statement is explicitly 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, and `fac` is a list of integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies |`A_i`| <= 10^9. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    return func_3(fac[n], func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])))
    #The program returns the result of func_3 applied to fac[n] and the result of func_5 applied to the result of func_3 applied to fac[n - k] and fac[k]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^5), a positive integer `k` (where 1 <= k <= n), and a list of integers `fac` (where each integer satisfies |A_i| <= 10^9). It returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it computes and returns the result of applying `func_3` to `fac[n]` and the result of `func_5` applied to the result of `func_3` with `fac[n - k]` and `fac[k]`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies |A_i| <= 10^9.
def func_7():
    n, k = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    fac = [0] * (n + 5)
    fac[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 5):
        fac[i] = func_3(fac[i - 1], i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[1]` to `fac[n + 4]` are the results of `func_3` applied iteratively, `i` is `n + 4`.
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])
        
        ways = func_6(n, k, fac)
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))
        
        ans = func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the final accumulated result based on updates from all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `ways` is the last computed value from `func_2` and `func_6`, and `diff` is the last computed difference from `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It calculates a result based on combinations of differences between adjacent sorted values in the list and the number of ways to choose subsets of size `k`. The result is accumulated in `ans`, which is then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value, but it performs calculations using external functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_6`, which are not defined within the provided code. The correctness of the overall result depends on the logic of these external functions.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
