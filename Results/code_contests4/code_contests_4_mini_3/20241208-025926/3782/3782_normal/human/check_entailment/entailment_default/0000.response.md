To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code and output hints thoroughly.

### Problem Description:
The program aims to find the sum of the function \( f(S) = \max S - \min S \) over all ways to choose \( K \) integers from a given set of \( N \) integers. The expected output is this sum modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Code Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: Incorrectly tries to append `b` to `a` which leads to a TypeError. The intended functionality seems to be to add `b` to `a`.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: Attempts to subtract `b` from a list `a`, which is not valid and will cause a TypeError.
   - **func_3(a, b)**: Tries to multiply a list `a` with an integer `b`, which does not work as intended.
   - **func_4(a, b)**: Recursively computes based on `b`, but it does not handle cases where `b` is negative or non-integer.
   - **func_5(a)**: Calls `func_4` with `mod` set to -2, which is incorrect as `mod` should not be negative.
   - **func_6(n, k, fac)**: This function relies on others that have issues, particularly in how it computes combinations using `fac`.
   - **func_7()**: Reads input and performs calculations but relies on the correctness of prior functions.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints for each function describe various issues such as TypeErrors and incorrect handling of data types. The hints indicate that the functions do not behave as intended and do not align with standard operations in Python.

### Identifying Edge Cases:
1. The program does not handle cases where:
   - The input list contains duplicate values which might affect the calculation of \( \max S \) and \( \min S \) if not handled correctly.
   - The case where \( K = 1 \) should return a sum of 0 because \( f(S) = 0 \) for any single element.
   - The function may encounter an empty combination scenario if \( K \) exceeds \( N \), which should return 0 but the checks may not be appropriately implemented.
   
2. The program doesn't seem to provide any proper error handling or checks for invalid input scenarios, which could lead to runtime errors.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the code and the output hints:
- The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
- The functions have significant issues that will lead to errors during execution, and the handling of specific edge cases is missing.

Correctness: **False**.
