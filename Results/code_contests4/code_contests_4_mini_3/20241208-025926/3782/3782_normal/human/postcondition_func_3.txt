The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It returns 1 if `b` is 0. If `b` is odd, it returns the result of `func_3` applied to list `a` and a recursive call to itself with `b - 1`. If `b` is even, it returns the square of the result from a recursive call to itself with `b / 2`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `b` is negative or non-integer values, which could lead to potential errors.
