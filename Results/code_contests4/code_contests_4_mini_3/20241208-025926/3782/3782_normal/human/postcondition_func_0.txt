The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`, and returns a new list formed by appending `b` to `a`. However, the code incorrectly attempts to add `b` to `a`, which will cause a TypeError because it is trying to concatenate an integer to a list directly. The intended functionality seems to be to return the list `a` with `b` appended to it without any modulus operation. The code does not correctly handle the addition of `b` to `a`, and thus the function will not work as expected.
