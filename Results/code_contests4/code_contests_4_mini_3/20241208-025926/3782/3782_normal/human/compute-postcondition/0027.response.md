The value of `ways` is updated based on the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)`. The previous state of `ways` is not given, but it is now assigned a new value from `func_6`. The other variables (`i`, `diff`, `ans`) remain unaffected by this specific line of code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `ways` based on the function call.

Output State: **`ways` is updated based on `func_6(n, k, fac)`**
