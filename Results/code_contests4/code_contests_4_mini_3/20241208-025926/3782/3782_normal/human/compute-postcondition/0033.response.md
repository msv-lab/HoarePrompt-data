The function `func_7` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without any input parameters. It operates on the global context or some internal state not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot identify any specific input parameters for `func_7`.

However, based on the constraints provided, we can infer the expected behavior of the function in relation to those constraints. Nevertheless, since there are no explicit parameters, we cannot describe what `func_7` accepts.

The output details are also missing, so we cannot define what the function returns.

Due to the lack of explicit parameters and output information, we cannot describe the functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified based on the given information.**
