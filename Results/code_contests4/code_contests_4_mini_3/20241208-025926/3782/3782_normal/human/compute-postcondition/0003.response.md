`fac[0]` is assigned the value `1`, and this directly impacts the `fac` list. The previous values of `fac` were initialized to zeros, so after this assignment, `fac[0]` becomes `1` while the rest of the elements remain zero. The states of the other variables (`N`, `K`, `A`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from input; `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from input; `fac` is a list of size `n + 5` where `fac[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from input; `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from input; `fac` is a list of size `n + 5` where `fac[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
