According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop is defined to iterate from 1 to `n + 4` (since the range is exclusive of the upper bound). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, which is given in the state. 

Before the loop starts, `fac[0]` is set to 1, and all other elements of `fac` are initialized to 0. The variable `i` will start at 1, and during the first iteration, it will be 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which it is based on the initial state given. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is assigned the second integer from input, `fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.**
