To determine whether the for loop can execute, we need to analyze the loop's structure and the state of the variables involved. The loop is defined as follows:

```
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the `range(n - 1)` produces at least one value. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the provided states:
- `fac[0]` is 1
- `fac[1]` to `fac[n + 4]` are the results of `func_3` applied iteratively
- `i` is `n + 4`
- `a` is sorted
- `ans` is initialized to 0

We need to ensure that the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are satisfied. 

1. **Variable `n`**: For the loop to execute, we need `n` to be at least 1, so `n >= 1`.
2. **Variable `i`**: Since `i` is initialized to `n + 4`, at the start of the loop `i` will take values from `0` to `n - 2` (if `n - 1` is positive, which it will be if `n >= 1`).

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time:
- `n` should be greater than or equal to 1.
- The initial value of `i` is not relevant for the first execution of the loop since `i` is assigned a value from the range.

Final state representation for the loop to execute:
State: **`fac[0]` is 1, `fac[1]` to `fac[n + 4]` are the results of `func_3` applied iteratively, `i` is `n + 4, a is sorted, ans is initialized to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
