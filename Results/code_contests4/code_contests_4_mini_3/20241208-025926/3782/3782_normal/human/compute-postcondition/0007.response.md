The function `func_3` is called with the arguments `fac[i - 1]` and `i`. Given that `fac[0]` is 1 and `i` is 2, the value of `fac[i - 1]` is `fac[1]`, which is not defined in the initial state. However, we know `i` is 2, so we are executing the assignment `fac[2] = func_3(fac[1], 2)`. Without the value of `fac[1]`, we cannot determine the outcome of `fac[2]`. 

Therefore, the output state describes that `fac[2]` is assigned a value from the function call, but we cannot specify that value due to the unknown `fac[1]`.

Output State: **`fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 2, and `fac[2]` is assigned the value from `func_3(fac[1], 2)` which cannot be determined.**
