The loop iterates from 1 to `n + 4`, inclusive, which means it will execute a total of `n + 4` times. The variable `fac[i]` is assigned the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` at each iteration. The initial value of `fac[0]` is 1, and the values of `fac[1]`, `fac[2]`, `fac[3]`, etc., will depend on the output of the `func_3` function applied to the previous value and the current index `i`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed, the last value computed will be `fac[n + 4]`, which is the result of `func_3(fac[n + 3], n + 4)`. The specific values of `fac[1]`, `fac[2]`, ..., `fac[n + 4]` cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `func_3`.

The final state of the variables after the loop executes is as follows:
- `fac[0]` is 1,
- `fac[1]`, `fac[2]`, ..., `fac[n + 4]` are the results of successive applications of `func_3` starting from `fac[0]` and the corresponding index,
- `i` will be `n + 4`.

Output State: **`fac[0]` is 1, `fac[1]` to `fac[n + 4]` are the results of `func_3` applied iteratively, `i` is `n + 4`.**
