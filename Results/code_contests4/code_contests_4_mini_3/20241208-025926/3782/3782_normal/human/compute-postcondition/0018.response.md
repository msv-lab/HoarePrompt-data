The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`. The function `func_3` takes `diff` and `ways` as arguments, but we do not have specific values for `diff` or `ways` at this time. The variable `ways` is previously assigned a value from `func_6(n, k, fac)`, but its specific value is also unknown. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` is updated based on the functions applied to the current values of `ans`, `diff`, and the unknown `ways`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)), where `ways` is based on func_6(n, k, fac) and `diff` is unknown.**
