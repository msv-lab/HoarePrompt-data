Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It calculates a result based on combinations of differences between adjacent sorted values in the list and the number of ways to choose subsets of size `k`. The result is accumulated in `ans`, which is then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value, but it performs calculations using external functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_6`, which are not defined within the provided code. The correctness of the overall result depends on the logic of these external functions.**
