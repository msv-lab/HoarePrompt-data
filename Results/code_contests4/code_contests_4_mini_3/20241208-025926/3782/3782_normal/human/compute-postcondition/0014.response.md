The value of `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`. Given that `i` is `n + 4`, the values `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` will be the elements of the array `a` at those indices. The previous values of `a` are not known but are assumed to be sorted. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment to `diff`.

Output State: **`fac[0]` is 1, `fac[1]` to `fac[n + 4]` are the results of `func_3` applied iteratively, `i` is `n + 4, a` is sorted, `ans` is initialized to 0; `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])**
