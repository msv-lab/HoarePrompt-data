The function `func_6` is called with the parameters `n`, `k`, and `fac`, but its output is not specified in the provided information. The previous values of the variables `fac`, `n`, and `k` are not given, so we cannot determine how `ways` is calculated based on the inputs.

Since `ways` is assigned the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)`, but we do not know the implementation or output of `func_6`, the value of `ways` remains unknown.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ways` has been assigned a value based on the function call, but we cannot specify that value.

Output State: **`ways` is assigned the value from `func_6(n, k, fac)` but the result is unknown.**
