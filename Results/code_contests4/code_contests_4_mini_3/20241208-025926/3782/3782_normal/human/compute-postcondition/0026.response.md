Output State: **`ways` is updated based on `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`, `i` is `n`, `diff` is calculated as `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, `ans` is updated as `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`; `diff` is now assigned the value of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`.**
