The function `func_3` is called with the arguments `fac[i - 1]` and `i`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so `fac[i - 1]` refers to `fac[0]`, which is 1. Therefore, the function call is `func_3(1, 1)`. 

The value of `fac[i]` will be assigned the result of this function call. Since other variables are not affected by this line, the output state will reflect the updated value of `fac[i]` based on the result of `func_3`.

Assuming `func_3` returns a value (which we don't know because `func_3` is not defined), we can denote it as `result`. 

The output state will indicate that `fac[1]` is assigned this result.

Output State: **`fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 1, `fac[1]` is assigned the result of func_3(1, 1)**
