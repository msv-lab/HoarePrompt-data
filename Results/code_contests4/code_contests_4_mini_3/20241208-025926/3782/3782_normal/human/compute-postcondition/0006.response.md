According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop is set to run from `i = 1` to `i = n + 4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to be executed again, `n` must be at least 2, as `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n + 4`.

State: **`fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
