According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates while `i` is in the range from 1 to `n + 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment to 3. 

For the loop to still be valid, `n` must be such that `i` (which will be 3 in the next iteration) is less than or equal to `n + 4`. This means that `n` must be at least -1 (since `3 <= n + 4` implies `n >= -1`). 

Thus, the state at the beginning of the next iteration will reflect that `i` is now 3, and `n` must still satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least -1**
