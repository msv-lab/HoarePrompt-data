The function accepts a list of integers `a` where the first two integers represent `N` (the total number of integers) and `K` (the number of integers to choose). It returns the result of `func_4` when called with `a` and `mod` set to -2. The correctness of the result depends on the implementation of `func_4`, which is not provided here.
