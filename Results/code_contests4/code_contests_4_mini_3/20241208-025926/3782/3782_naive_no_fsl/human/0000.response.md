To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to compute the sum of the differences between the maximum and minimum elements of all possible subsets `S` of size `K` from a given list of integers `A`. The results should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Modulus Definition**: The modulus is correctly defined as \(10^9 + 7\).
2. **Factorial Precomputation**: `fac` is initialized and filled with factorial values which will be used for combinations.
3. **Combination Functions**: The functions for modular arithmetic and combinations are defined correctly.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the array to compute the differences between consecutive elements.
   - For each difference, it calculates the number of ways to choose subsets of size `K` including the current and next elements.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
1. **Single Element Case**: If `N = 1` and `K = 1`, the output should be `0` because `max(S) - min(S)` for a single element is `0`. The program should handle this, but since there's no explicit check for `N < K` in the main logic, it could potentially lead to incorrect calculations.
   
2. **Identical Elements**: If all elements in `A` are the same, then every subset of size `K` will also have `max(S) - min(S)` equal to `0`. The program should return `0` in this case. The example with input `3 1` confirms that the program handles this correctly.

3. **General Cases**: The way the program calculates combinations for the selection of elements seems to be sound. It might be worth validating that the combination calculations handle large values properly, especially since `N` can be as large as `100,000`.

### Potential Failing Case:
The sorting and iteration logic might not cover cases where:
- The value of `K` is greater than the number of unique elements which could lead to some incorrect calculations since the logic depends on choosing elements based on indices rather than values.

### Conclusion:
Considering the critical points and potential edge cases, the program is likely to fail in cases where the number of unique elements is less than `K`. Specifically, if the input is:
```
4 5
1 2 3 4
```
This would trigger an erroneous calculation since `K` cannot be greater than `N`.

Thus, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly handle the case where `K > N`, which is a valid input scenario according to the constraints.
