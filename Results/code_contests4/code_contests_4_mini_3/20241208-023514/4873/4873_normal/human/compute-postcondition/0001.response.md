The list `a` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that collects three inputs from the user, where each input is processed by `raw_input().strip()`. The variable `N` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100; `a` is a list containing 3 user-defined strings.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100; `a` is a list containing 3 user-defined strings.**
