The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `A`, `B`, and `C`. Each of these parameters is a string of length `N`, where `N` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint 1 <= N <= 100. After executing the function body, the function processes these strings and produces a result based on their contents. However, the specifics of the output are not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three strings `A`, `B`, and `C`, each of length `N`, where `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters A, B, and C, which are strings of length N, where N is a positive integer between 1 and 100.**
