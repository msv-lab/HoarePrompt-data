Functionality: ** The function accepts three strings A, B, and C, each of length N, where N is a positive integer between 1 and 100. It computes and prints the total count of unique characters across all three strings at each character index, subtracting the number of strings (which is always 3) from this count. This means that if there are no unique characters at a specific index, it will not contribute to the total. The function will handle cases where all characters at a specific index are the same, resulting in no unique characters being counted. **
