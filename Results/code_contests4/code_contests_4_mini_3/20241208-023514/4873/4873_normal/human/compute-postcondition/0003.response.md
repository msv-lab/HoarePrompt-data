According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 1. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, it can be any value within that range, but minimum is 1 for the loop to execute.

So, for the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than or equal to 1**
