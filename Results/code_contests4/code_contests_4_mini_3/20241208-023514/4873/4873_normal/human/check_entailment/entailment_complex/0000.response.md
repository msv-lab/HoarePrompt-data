Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. The main issue lies in how the program calculates the number of operations required to make the three strings equal.

### Explanation of the Issues:
1. **Logic Flaw in Counting Operations**: The program attempts to count unique characters at each index across the three strings and subtracts 1 for each unique character found. However, this does not correspond to the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal. The problem description requires determining how many changes need to be made to make all characters in the three strings the same, not just counting unique characters.

2. **Incorrect Approach**: The current method accumulates a count of unique characters for each index but does not translate this into the number of changes needed. For example, if at a specific index the characters are `a`, `b`, and `c`, the function will add `2` to `foo`, but it actually requires `2` operations to change two of the characters to match the third character.

3. **No Handling of Minimum Changes**: The algorithm does not consider the best strategy for minimizing changes. It simply counts unique characters but ignores that you should be changing characters to match the most common character at each index, which would minimize the number of operations.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
3
abc
abc
xyz
```
The expected output is `3` because we need to change `x`, `y`, and `z` to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. However, the program would incorrectly compute this based on unique counts leading to a wrong conclusion.

### Conclusion:
Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to an incorrect computation of the minimum number of operations required. Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is not correct.
