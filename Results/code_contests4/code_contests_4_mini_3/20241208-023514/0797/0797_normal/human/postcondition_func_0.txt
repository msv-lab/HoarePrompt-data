The function accepts two integers, N and K, where N is in the range [0, 10^{18}] and K is in the range [1, 10^{18}]. It computes the minimum of the two values: the remainder of N divided by K and the difference between K and that remainder. The function does not return a value but prints this minimum to the output.
