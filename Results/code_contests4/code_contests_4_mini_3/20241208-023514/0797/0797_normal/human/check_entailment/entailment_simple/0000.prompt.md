You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given any integer x, Aoki can do the operation below.

Operation: Replace x with the absolute difference of x and K.

You are given the initial value of an integer N. Find the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times.

Constraints

* 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18}
* 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{18}
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K


Output

Print the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are integers such that 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18} and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(N % K, K - N % K))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
