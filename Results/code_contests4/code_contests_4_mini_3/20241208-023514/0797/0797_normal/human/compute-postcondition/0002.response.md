The function `func` accepts two parameters, `N` and `K`. Both `N` and `K` are integers, with the constraints that \(0 \leq N \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq K \leq 10^{18}\). The function's output is not explicitly stated, so we will state that based on the provided context, it likely involves some operation using `N` and `K`. However, since no specific output behavior is given, we cannot describe the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, N and K, where N is an integer in the range [0, 10^{18}] and K is an integer in the range [1, 10^{18}]. The specific return value is not defined.**
