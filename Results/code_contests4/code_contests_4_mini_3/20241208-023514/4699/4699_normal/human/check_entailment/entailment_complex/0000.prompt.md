You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: It is nighttime and Joe the Elusive got into the country's main bank's safe. The safe has n cells positioned in a row, each of them contains some amount of diamonds. Let's make the problem more comfortable to work with and mark the cells with positive numbers from 1 to n from the left to the right.

Unfortunately, Joe didn't switch the last security system off. On the plus side, he knows the way it works.

Every minute the security system calculates the total amount of diamonds for each two adjacent cells (for the cells between whose numbers difference equals 1). As a result of this check we get an n - 1 sums. If at least one of the sums differs from the corresponding sum received during the previous check, then the security system is triggered.

Joe can move the diamonds from one cell to another between the security system's checks. He manages to move them no more than m times between two checks. One of the three following operations is regarded as moving a diamond: moving a diamond from any cell to any other one, moving a diamond from any cell to Joe's pocket, moving a diamond from Joe's pocket to any cell. Initially Joe's pocket is empty, and it can carry an unlimited amount of diamonds. It is considered that before all Joe's actions the system performs at least one check.

In the morning the bank employees will come, which is why Joe has to leave the bank before that moment. Joe has only k minutes left before morning, and on each of these k minutes he can perform no more than m operations. All that remains in Joe's pocket, is considered his loot.

Calculate the largest amount of diamonds Joe can carry with him. Don't forget that the security system shouldn't be triggered (even after Joe leaves the bank) and Joe should leave before morning.

Input

The first line contains integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 104, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 109). The next line contains n numbers. The i-th number is equal to the amount of diamonds in the i-th cell — it is an integer from 0 to 105.

Output

Print a single number — the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal.

Examples

Input

2 3 1
2 3


Output

0

Input

3 2 2
4 1 3


Output

2

Note

In the second sample Joe can act like this:

The diamonds' initial positions are 4 1 3.

During the first period of time Joe moves a diamond from the 1-th cell to the 2-th one and a diamond from the 3-th cell to his pocket.

By the end of the first period the diamonds' positions are 3 2 2. The check finds no difference and the security system doesn't go off.

During the second period Joe moves a diamond from the 3-rd cell to the 2-nd one and puts a diamond from the 1-st cell to his pocket.

By the end of the second period the diamonds' positions are 2 3 1. The check finds no difference again and the security system doesn't go off.

Now Joe leaves with 2 diamonds in his pocket.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each of the n cells, m is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute, and k is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before he must leave.
def func_1(A, m, k):
    n = len(A)
    if (n == 1) :
        return min(A[0], m * k)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the number of diamonds in the only cell (A[0]) and the total operations Joe can perform (m * k)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each of the n cells; `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute; `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before he must leave; `n` is the length of `A`, and `n` is greater than 1.
    if (n % 2 == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each of the n cells; `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute; `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before he must leave; `n` is the length of `A`, and `n` is greater than 1. Additionally, `n` is an odd integer.
    moves = n / 2 + 1
    if (moves > m) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `moves` is (n + 1) / 2, and `moves` is less than or equal to `m`.
    M = min(A[0:n:2])
    return min(M, m / moves * k)
    #The program returns the minimum value between M and (m divided by moves multiplied by k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `A`, a positive integer `m`, and a positive integer `k`. It returns the minimum number of diamonds that can be collected based on several conditions: if there is only one cell, it returns the minimum of the diamonds in that cell and the total possible operations (m * k); if the number of cells is even, it returns 0; if the number of required moves (half the number of cells plus one) exceeds `m`, it also returns 0; otherwise, it returns the minimum of the smallest number of diamonds in the cells at even indices and the calculated maximum possible diamonds that can be collected given the available operations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
