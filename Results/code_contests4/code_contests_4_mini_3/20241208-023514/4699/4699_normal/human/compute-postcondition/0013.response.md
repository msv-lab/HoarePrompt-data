The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `A`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `A` is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each of the n cells.
- `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before he must leave.

Based on the output conditions:
- In Case 1, if there is only one cell, the function returns the minimum value between the number of diamonds in that cell (A[0]) and the total operations Joe can perform (m * k).
- In Case 2, the function returns 0.
- In Case 3, the function returns 0.
- In Case 4, the function returns the minimum value between M and (m divided by moves multiplied by k).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `A`, a positive integer `m`, and a positive integer `k`, and to return a value based on the number of diamonds, the maximum operations, and the time constraints in various cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers A, a positive integer m, and a positive integer k, and returns a value based on different conditions related to the number of diamonds and the operations Joe can perform.**
