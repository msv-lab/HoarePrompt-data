Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `A`, a positive integer `m`, and a positive integer `k`. It returns the minimum number of diamonds that can be collected based on several conditions: if there is only one cell, it returns the minimum of the diamonds in that cell and the total possible operations (m * k); if the number of cells is even, it returns 0; if the number of required moves (half the number of cells plus one) exceeds `m`, it also returns 0; otherwise, it returns the minimum of the smallest number of diamonds in the cells at even indices and the calculated maximum possible diamonds that can be collected given the available operations. **
