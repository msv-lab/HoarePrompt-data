#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each of the n cells, m is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute, and k is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before he must leave.
def func_1(A, m, k):
    n = len(A)
    if (n == 1) :
        return min(A[0], m * k)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the number of diamonds in the only cell (A[0]) and the total operations Joe can perform (m * k)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each of the n cells; `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute; `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before he must leave; `n` is the length of `A`, and `n` is greater than 1.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each of the n cells; `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute; `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before he must leave; `n` is the length of `A`, and `n` is greater than 1.

    moves = n / 2 + 1
    if (moves > m) :

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `moves` is (n + 1) / 2, and `moves` is less than or equal to `m`.
    M = min(A[0:n:2])
    return min(M, m / moves * k)
    #The program returns the minimum value between M and (m divided by moves multiplied by k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `A`, a positive integer `m`, and a positive integer `k`. It returns the minimum number of diamonds that can be collected based on several conditions: if there is only one cell, it returns the minimum of the diamonds in that cell and the total possible operations (m * k); if the number of cells is even, it returns 0; if the number of required moves (half the number of cells plus one) exceeds `m`, it also returns 0; otherwise, it returns the minimum of the smallest number of diamonds in the cells at even indices and the calculated maximum possible diamonds that can be collected given the available operations.
