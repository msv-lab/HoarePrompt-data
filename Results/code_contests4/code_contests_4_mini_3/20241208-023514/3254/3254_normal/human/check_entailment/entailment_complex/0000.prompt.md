You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p1, p2, ..., pn for his birthday.

Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a1, a2, ..., an is a pair of indexes i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that an inequality ai > aj holds.

Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p1, p2, ..., pn (|pi| ≤ 105). The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, and p is a list of n integers where each integer pi satisfies |pi| ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    N, a, ans = input(), map(lambda x: abs(int(x)), raw_input().split()), 0
    for i in xrange(0, N):
        x, y = 0, 0
        
        for j in xrange(0, N):
            if a[j] < a[i]:
                if j < i:
                    x += 1
                else:
                    y += 1
        
        ans += min(x, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is equal to `n`; `i` is `N - 1`; `x` is the count of elements in `a` with indices less than `N - 1` that are less than `a[N - 1]`; `y` is the count of elements in `a` with indices greater than or equal to `N - 1` that are less than `a[N - 1]`; `ans` is the accumulated sum of min(`x`, `y`) for each iteration of `i` from 0 to `N - 1`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer satisfies |ai| ≤ 10^5. It calculates the sum of the minimum counts of elements less than each element `a[i]` that are positioned before (`x`) and after (`y`) `i`. The function prints the accumulated result of these minimum counts across all elements in the list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
