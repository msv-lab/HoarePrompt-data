Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer satisfies |ai| ≤ 10^5. It calculates the sum of the minimum counts of elements less than each element `a[i]` that are positioned before (`x`) and after (`y`) `i`. The function prints the accumulated result of these minimum counts across all elements in the list.**
