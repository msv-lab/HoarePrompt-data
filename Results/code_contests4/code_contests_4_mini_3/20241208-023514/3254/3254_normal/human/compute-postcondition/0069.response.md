The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000. The parameter `p` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `pi` in the list satisfies the constraint |pi| ≤ 10^5. The functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in the output provided, but it can be inferred that it processes the list of integers based on the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`, where `n` indicates the number of integers in the list `p`, and each integer in `p` adheres to specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and a list `p` of `n` integers, where each integer satisfies |pi| ≤ 10^5.**
