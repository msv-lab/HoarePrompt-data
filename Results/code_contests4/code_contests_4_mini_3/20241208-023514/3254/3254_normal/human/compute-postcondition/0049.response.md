Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is an integer such that j < i, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding min(`x`, `y`), and the element at index `j` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` of list `a`.***
