Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `ans` is increased by min(`x`, `y`). If `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to 0, while ensuring that the element at index `j` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` of list `a`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `x` is set to 0 and `y` is set to 1, while still maintaining that the element at index `j` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` of list `a`.***
