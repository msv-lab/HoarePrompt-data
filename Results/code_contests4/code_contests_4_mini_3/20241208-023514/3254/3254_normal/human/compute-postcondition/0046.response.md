The variables `x` and `y` are both assigned the value of `0`. The previous values of `x` and `y` were already `0` from the initial state, so their values remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `ans` is updated by adding min(`x`, `y`).**
