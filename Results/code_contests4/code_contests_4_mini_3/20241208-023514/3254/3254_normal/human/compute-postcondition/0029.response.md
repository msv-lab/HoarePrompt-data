Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by min(`x`, `y`), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `j` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `i`. The element at index `j` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` of list `a`.***
