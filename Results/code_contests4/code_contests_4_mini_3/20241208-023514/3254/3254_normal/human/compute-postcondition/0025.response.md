According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `N`. Since `N` is greater than 1, the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `j` will be equal to `N - 1`. The other variables, `n`, `p`, `i`, `ans`, `x`, and `y`, do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but we can note their initial states. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be initialized to 0, and we can confirm that `N` is greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by min(`x`, `y`), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
