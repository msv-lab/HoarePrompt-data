Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `x` is the count of elements in `a` with indices less than `i` that are less than `a[i]`; `y` is the count of elements in `a` with indices greater than or equal to `i` that are less than `a[i]`; `ans` is updated by adding min(`x`, `y`).**
