Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `ans` is increased by min(`x`, `y`). If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and if `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `x` is set to 0 and `y` is set to 1, while ensuring that `a[j] < a[i]`. The values of `x` and `y` are adjusted according to the relationship between `j` and `i`, while maintaining the condition that the element at index `j` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` of list `a`.***
