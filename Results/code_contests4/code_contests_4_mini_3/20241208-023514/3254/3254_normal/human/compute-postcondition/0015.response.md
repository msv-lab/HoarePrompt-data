Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than `0`, `i` is 0, `ans` is initialized to 0. If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then if `j` is less than `i`, `x` is either 2 or 1, and `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, `x` is set to 0 and `y` is set to 1, while `y` is incremented by 1 as long as the condition `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` holds true.***
