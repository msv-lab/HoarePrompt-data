Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the element at index `j` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` of list `a`. If `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1, `y` is set to 0, and `ans` is updated by adding min(1, 0). Otherwise, if `j` is not less than `i`, then `x` is set to 0, `y` is set to 1, and `ans` is updated by adding min(0, 1).***
