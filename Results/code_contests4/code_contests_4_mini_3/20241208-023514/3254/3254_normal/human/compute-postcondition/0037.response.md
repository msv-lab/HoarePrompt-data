Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `ans` is increased by min(`x`, `y`). If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and if `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `y` is increased by 1. If `a[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, no changes occur in `x` or `y`.***
