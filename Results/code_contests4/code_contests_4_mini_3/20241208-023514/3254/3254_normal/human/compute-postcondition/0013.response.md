Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than `0`, `i` is 0, `ans` is initialized to 0, `x` is either set to 1 and `y` to 0 if `j` is less than `i`, or `x` is set to 0 and `y` to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, while the condition `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` holds true; `y` is incremented by 1.**
