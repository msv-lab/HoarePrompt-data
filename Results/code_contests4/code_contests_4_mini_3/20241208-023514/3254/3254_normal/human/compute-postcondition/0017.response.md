The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown as it is not defined in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `ans` is initialized to 0, `j` is 1, and `x` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `ans` is initialized to 0, `j` is 1, and `x` is increased by 1.**
