According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is greater than 1. The loop will increase `j` by 1 for the next iteration, so `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1, which it already is.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `ans` is increased by min(`x`, `y`); for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 1.**
