Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `j` is 2. If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and if `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is increased by 1; otherwise, `y` is increased by 1. If `a[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, no actions are taken.***
