According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is greater than `j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its last value, which is `j` equal to `N-1`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `N`. 

Additionally, since `j` is now equal to `N`, the condition for the loop to continue must hold true, which is `j` must be less than `N`. However, since `j` is equal to `N`, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least one more time, `N` must be greater than `j`, which means `N` must be at least `N + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than `0`, `i` is 0, `ans` is initialized to 0, `x` is either set to 1 and `y` to 0 if `j` is less than `i`, or `x` is set to 0 and `y` to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, while the condition `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` holds true, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `N` (i.e., at least `N + 1`).**
