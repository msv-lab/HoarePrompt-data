Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is initialized to 0, if `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1, `y` is 0, and the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `x` is set to 0, `y` is 1, and the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`.***
