Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is equal to `n`; `i` is `N - 1`; `x` is the count of elements in `a` with indices less than `N - 1` that are less than `a[N - 1]`; `y` is the count of elements in `a` with indices greater than or equal to `N - 1` that are less than `a[N - 1]`; `ans` is the accumulated sum of min(`x`, `y`) for each iteration of `i` from 0 to `N - 1`.**
