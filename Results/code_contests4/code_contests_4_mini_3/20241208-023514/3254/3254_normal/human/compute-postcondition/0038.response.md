According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is currently at 0 (the first iteration). The loop runs while `j` is incremented from 0 to `N-1`. 

Since `N` is greater than 1, `j` must be less than `N` for the loop to execute one more time. After the current iteration where `j` is at 0, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be 1, and `N` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `ans` is increased by min(`x`, `y`); for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
