To analyze the impact of the provided code, we note that `l` is initially assigned the last element of `le`, which is a string. The code snippet is using a list comprehension to create a new list `l` based on certain conditions.

1. The list comprehension iterates over a range of integers from `0` to `n-1` (since `range(n)` generates numbers from `0` to `n-1`).
2. For each integer `k` in this range, it checks if `l[k]` is equal to the string `'*'`.
3. The new list `l` will contain all indices `k` where the condition is true.

Since `l` has been reassigned to this new list, we need to consider the previous state of `l` after the pop operation. The previous state of `l` before this assignment would be one string (the last element of `le`), but it is now a list of indices.

The output state would reflect that `l` is now a list of indices that met the condition and that the previous single string value is no longer valid for `l`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less element; `n` is the integer value of the new last string in `le`; `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences from `med`; `l` is now a list of indices where the elements of the previous string matched '*'**.
