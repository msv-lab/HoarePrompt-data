According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value that is popped from the list `le`. The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element of the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, the list `le` must contain at least one element before the loop starts to ensure that `int(le.pop())` provides a value greater than 0.

Assuming `le` has at least one string before the loop starts, the first iteration of the loop will occur with `zorg` initialized to the integer value of the last element in `le`, and after `pop()`, `le` will have one less element.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `le` is not empty and that it contains a valid string representation of a positive integer.

State: **`le` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `af` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `zorg` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before pop()**
