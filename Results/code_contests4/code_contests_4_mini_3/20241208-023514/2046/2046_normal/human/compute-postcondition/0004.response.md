The value of `l` is assigned the last element of the list `le`, which is removed from `le` using the `pop()` method. The variable `n` remains unchanged and still holds the integer value of the last string in `le` before the operation, and `af` remains an empty list. After executing the code, `le` will have one less element.

Output State: **`le` is now a list with one less element; `af` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped; `l` is the last element of `le` before it was popped.**
