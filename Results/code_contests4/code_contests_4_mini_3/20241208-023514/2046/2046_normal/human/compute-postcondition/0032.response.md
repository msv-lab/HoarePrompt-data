Output State: **`le` is a list with fewer elements than the initial state; `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences from `med` for each iteration where `l` was populated, and if `l` was empty in any iteration, `af` includes a corresponding 0 for that iteration; `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was fully processed; the output is the string representation of each element in `af` joined by new lines.**
