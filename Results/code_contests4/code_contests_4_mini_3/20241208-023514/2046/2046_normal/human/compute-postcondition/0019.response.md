The code appends the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the value `med` to the list `af`. The value of `med` is the middle element of `l`, and since `l` is a list of differences between indices, `med` has a specific value. The output state reflects the addition of this computed sum to the list `af`. 

Output State: **`med` is assigned the value of the middle element of `l`; `af` is updated to include the sum of abs(k - med) for k in l.**
