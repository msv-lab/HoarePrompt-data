The code appends to the list `af` the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`. The variable `med` is calculated as the middle element of `l` using integer division of its length by 2. 

Since `l` is truthy (not empty), we can proceed to calculate `sum(abs(k - med) for k in l)`. The value of `n` is not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, after executing the code, `af` will contain one new element which is the calculated sum. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less element; `af` is a list with one new element which is the sum of absolute differences from `med`; `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped; `l` is the last element of `le` before it was popped; `l` is truthy; `med` is the middle element of `l`.**
