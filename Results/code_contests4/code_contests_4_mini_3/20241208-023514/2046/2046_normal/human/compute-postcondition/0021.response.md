Postcondition: ***`le` is a list with one less element, `n` is the integer value of the new last string in `le`, and `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences from `med`. If `l` is not empty, `med` is assigned the value of the middle element of `l`, and `af` is updated to include the sum of abs(k - med) for k in `l`. If `l` is empty, `af` still contains the sum of absolute differences from `med`, now including an additional element `0`, and `l` is changed to a list of differences between indices in the previous list.***
