Output State: **`le` is a list with fewer elements than the initial state, `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences from `med` for each iteration where `l` was populated; if `l` was empty in any iteration, `af` includes a corresponding 0 for that iteration, and `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was fully processed.**
