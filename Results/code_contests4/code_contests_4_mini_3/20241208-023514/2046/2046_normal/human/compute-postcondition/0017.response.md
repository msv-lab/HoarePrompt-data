The code modifies the list `l` by reassigning it to a new list generated by the list comprehension. Specifically, each element of the new list is calculated as the difference between the indices `b` and `a` of the elements in the original list `l`. The previous values of `l` are used in this calculation. The values of the other variables (`le`, `n`, `af`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less element; `n` is the integer value of the new last string in `le`; `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences from `med`; `l` is changed to a list of differences between indices in the previous list.**
