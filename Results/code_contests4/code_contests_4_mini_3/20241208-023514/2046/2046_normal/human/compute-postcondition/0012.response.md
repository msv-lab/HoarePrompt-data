Postcondition: ***`le` is a list with one less element. If `l` is truthy, then `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences from `med`, where `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped. If `l` is not truthy, then `af` is a list containing a single element (0), with `n` also being the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped.***
