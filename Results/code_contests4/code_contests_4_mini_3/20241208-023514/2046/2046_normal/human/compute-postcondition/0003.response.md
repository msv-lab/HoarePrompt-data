The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of the last string in the list `le` before it is popped. After executing `le.pop()`, the last string is removed from `le`. The value of `zorg` was the integer value of the last string before it was removed. The variable `af` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `le` is now a list with one less element, `af` is an empty list, and `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped.

Output State: **`le` is now a list with one less element, `af` is an empty list, and `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped.**
