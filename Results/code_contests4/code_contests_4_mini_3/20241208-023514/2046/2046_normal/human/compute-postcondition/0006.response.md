The code attempts to create a new list `l` by using a list comprehension that calculates `(b - a)` for each pair of values `a` and `b` generated by `enumerate(l)`. However, since `l` is the last element of `le` before it was popped, and given the context of an error due to an invalid operation, it suggests that `l` is not suitable for enumeration or manipulation in this way.

The previous state indicates that `l` is not a valid list or is empty after the pop operation. Therefore, the list comprehension cannot execute properly, leading to an error.

Since the execution could not be completed successfully, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`le` is now a list with one less element; `af` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped; `l` is the last element of `le` before it was popped, and an error occurred due to the invalid operation.**
