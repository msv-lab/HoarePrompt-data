The code `af.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `af`. The state of `le`, `n`, and `l` remains unchanged as they are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the addition of `0` to the list `af`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less element; `n` is the integer value of the new last string in `le`; `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences from `med`, and `af` now includes an additional element `0`; `l` is changed to a list of differences between indices in the previous list.**
