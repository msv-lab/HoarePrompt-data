The list comprehension assigns `l` to a new list containing indices `k` from `0` to `n-1` where the corresponding elements in the original list `l` equal the string `'*'`. However, since `l` was previously the last element of `le` before it was popped, it is not a list but rather a single value. As such, the code will likely lead to an error because `l` is not subscriptable in the context itâ€™s used. 

Since the initial state describes `l` as the last element of `le` before it was popped, and assumes `n` is the integer value of that last string, the condition will not yield any valid results. Thus, the output state reflects that the variables have not changed due to an invalid operation.

Output State: **`le` is now a list with one less element; `af` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped; `l` is the last element of `le` before it was popped, and an error occurred due to the invalid operation.**
