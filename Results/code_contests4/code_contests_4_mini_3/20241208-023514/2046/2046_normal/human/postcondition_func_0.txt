The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a string of length `n` containing characters `.` and `*`. It calculates the median position of the `*` characters in the string and sums the absolute differences between each `*`'s position and the median. If there are no `*` characters, it appends 0 to the results for that test case. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. If all strings contain only `.` (i.e., no `*`), the function will return 0 for those cases.
