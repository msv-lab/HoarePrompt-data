Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and the length of the string describing the level is equal to n, consisting only of the characters '.' and '*'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
