To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both its logic and the possible edge cases that might arise.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of bottles (1 ≤ n ≤ 50)
   - `w`: Volume of each bottle (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000)
   - `m`: Number of friends (2 ≤ m ≤ 50)

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Print "YES" if it's possible to pour the milk so that the milk from each bottle is in no more than two different cups.
   - If possible, print the distribution of milk in each cup.
   - Print "NO" if it's not possible.

### Functionality of the Code
- The code defines classes `Bottle` and `Cup` to handle the logic of pouring milk from bottles into cups.
- The function `func_3` manages the pouring of milk into cups while ensuring that no bottle is poured into more than two cups.
- The logic includes checks to ensure that cups don't overflow and that bottles are emptied appropriately.

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **When `m` is greater than `2 * n`**: 
   - Each bottle can be poured into a maximum of two cups, meaning at most `2 * n` cups can be filled. If `m` exceeds `2 * n`, it's impossible to distribute the milk as required, leading to a "NO" output.
   - For example, with `n = 3`, `w = 500`, and `m = 8`, the output should be "NO" because `8 > 2 * 3`.

2. **When `m` is less than or equal to `2 * n`**: 
   - The code seems to handle this case adequately, as it attempts to fill the cups according to the conditions specified.

### Verification of the Code
- The code checks if there are enough cups to distribute the milk from the bottles properly. 
- It uses a greedy approach to fill the cups by pouring from the bottles into the next available cup and ensuring that no bottle pours into more than two cups.
- The checks for overflow and empty conditions seem correct.

### Conclusion
The key issue arises with the condition `m > 2 * n`, which is not explicitly checked in the code before attempting to pour milk, leading to potential incorrect outputs in such cases.

### Final Verdict
Correctness: **False**

In the scenario where `n = 3`, `w = 500`, and `m = 8`, the program should output "NO", but it might not due to the lack of an explicit check for `m`. Hence, the program does not fully satisfy the problem requirements under all conditions.
