Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Logic and Definitions**: The program contains three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), but their purpose and implementation do not align with the requirements of the problem. Specifically, there is no clear handling of how to check if it is possible to distribute the milk according to the rules laid out (i.e., ensuring that each bottle's milk goes into no more than two different cups).

2. **Bottle and Cup Classes**: The program references `Bottle` and `Cup` classes, but these classes are not defined in the provided code. The problem description requires a specific implementation for distributing the milk among the cups, which includes managing the milk volume and the constraints on the number of cups. Without the definitions of these classes and their methods (like `is_empty()`, `is_full()`, etc.), we cannot determine if the program can appropriately manage the milk distribution.

3. **Distribution Logic**: The logic in `func_3` does not ensure that all friends receive the correct amount of milk, nor does it guarantee that each bottle is poured into at most two cups. The loop structure does not consider scenarios where certain cups may not be able to accept milk without violating the constraints.

4. **Output Specification**: The output format specified in the problem description requires a specific structure (i.e., printing "YES" or "NO" followed by the milk distribution). The program's output mechanism does not align with this requirement.

In summary, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, both in terms of functionality and implementation. Therefore, it is incorrect.
