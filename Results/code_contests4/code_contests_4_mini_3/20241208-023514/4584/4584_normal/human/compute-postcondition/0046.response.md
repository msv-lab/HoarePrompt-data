Postcondition: ***`bottle` is a Bottle instance with identifier 2 and `bi` is `ci + 1`. If the bottle is not empty, the function returns an empty list []. If `ci + 1` exceeds `m`, there is no return value, and the function proceeds without a return. In the case where `bottle` is empty, no action is taken as there is no else part defined.***
