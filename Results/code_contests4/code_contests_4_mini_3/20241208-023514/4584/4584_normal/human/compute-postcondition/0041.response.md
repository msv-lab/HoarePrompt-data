The function `func_2` is called with the arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`. The value of `bottle` remains the same as it was initially, which is the Bottle instance with identifier 2. The value of `cups[ci]` depends on the current state of the `cups` list and the value of `ci`. However, the initial state does not provide specific information about the `cups` list or the value of `ci`. Thus, the output state reflects the initial state of `bottle`, the assignment of `bottle`, and the function call without changing any existing values.

Output State: **`bottle` is the Bottle instance with identifier 2; `bi` is `ci + 1`; function `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`.**
