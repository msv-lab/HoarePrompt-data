Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `w` is an integer such that 100 ≤ `w` ≤ 1000, `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle instances with identifiers from 1 to `n` and weight `w`, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(`n` * `w`) / float(`m`), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances created, `ci` is equal to `m - 1` if all `m` cups are full, otherwise `ci` is the maximum index of `cups` that is full, and `bottle` is the last Bottle instance in `bottles` processed.**
