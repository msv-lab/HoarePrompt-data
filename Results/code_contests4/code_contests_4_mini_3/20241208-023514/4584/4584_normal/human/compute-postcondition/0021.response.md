The value of `ci` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ci` is 2, so after execution, `ci` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `w` is an integer such that 100 ≤ `w` ≤ 1000, `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle instances with identifiers from 1 to `n` and weight `w`, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(`n` * `w`) / float(`m`), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances created, `ci` is 3, `bi` is 0, `bottle` is the first Bottle instance in `bottles` with identifier 1 and weight `w`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `w` is an integer such that 100 ≤ `w` ≤ 1000, `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle instances with identifiers from 1 to `n` and weight `w`, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(`n` * `w`) / float(`m`), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances created, `ci` is 3, `bi` is 0, `bottle` is the first Bottle instance in `bottles` with identifier 1 and weight `w`.**
