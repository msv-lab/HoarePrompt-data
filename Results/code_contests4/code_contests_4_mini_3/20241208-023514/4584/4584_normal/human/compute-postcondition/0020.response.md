According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci` and `m`. The loop condition states that `ci + 1` must be less than `m` and `cups[ci].is_full()` must return `True` for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ci` is 2. Therefore, for the condition `ci + 1 < m` to hold true, `m` must be greater than 3. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the condition based on the current state of `m`. Since we don't know the exact value of `m`, we simply need to specify that `m` must be greater than 3. There are no other states that need to be adjusted based on the information provided.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `w` is an integer such that 100 ≤ `w` ≤ 1000, `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle instances with identifiers from 1 to `n` and weight `w`, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(`n` * `w`) / float(`m`), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances created, `ci` is 2, `bi` is 0, `bottle` is the first Bottle instance in `bottles` with identifier 1 and weight `w` and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 3.**
