Output State: **`bottle` is a Bottle instance with identifier 2; `ci` is incremented to the maximum value such that `ci + 1` is less than `m` and `cups[ci]` is full. If `ci + 1` reaches `m`, the loop terminates and `ci` will be one less than `m`, otherwise `ci` will reflect the last index of `cups` that is full.**
