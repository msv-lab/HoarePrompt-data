The variable `ci` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new value of `ci`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `w` is an integer such that 100 ≤ `w` ≤ 1000; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle instances with identifiers from 1 to `n` and weight `w`; `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(`n` * `w`) / float(`m`); `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances created; `ci` is 0.**
