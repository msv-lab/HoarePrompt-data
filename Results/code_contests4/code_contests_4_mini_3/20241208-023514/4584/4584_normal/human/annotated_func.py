#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, w is an integer such that 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 50.
def func_1(x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -x < eps
        #The program returns True or False based on whether the absolute value of x is less than eps, since x is less than 0, -x will be a positive value.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `w` is an integer such that 100 ≤ `w` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 50, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
    return x < eps
    #The program returns whether x is less than eps
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `x` and checks if `x` is less than a variable `eps`. It returns True if `x` is less than `eps` or if `x` is negative and its absolute value (i.e., `-x`) is less than `eps`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and not less than `eps`, it returns False. This means the function effectively evaluates whether `x` is within a certain proximity to zero defined by `eps`.

    else :
        bottle.milk -= space_in_cup
        cup.milk = cup.capacity
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, space_in_cup))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`bottle` is an integer representing the number of different kinds of milk, `cup` is an integer representing the number of friends, and `space_in_cup` is the remaining space in the cup. If `bottle.milk` is less than or equal to `space_in_cup`, then `cup.milk` is increased by 0.0, and `cup.ingredients` includes a tuple of `(bottle.no, 0.0)`. Otherwise, `cup.ingredients` now includes an entry of `(bottle.no, space_in_cup)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating successful execution of the code without any errors.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `bottle`, which represents an object containing information about different kinds of milk, and `cup`, which represents an object with information about the number of friends and its current milk capacity. The function returns `False` if the `bottle` is empty or the `cup` is full. If neither condition is true, it transfers milk from the `bottle` to the `cup`, updating both objects accordingly, and returns `True`. However, the function lacks error handling for cases where the `bottle` or `cup` object might not have the expected attributes or methods, which could lead to runtime errors.

    return [cup.ingridients for cup in cups]
    #The program returns a list of ingredients from each cup in the list 'cups'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `w`, and `m`, where `n` is the number of bottles (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `w` is the weight of each bottle (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000), and `m` is the number of cups (2 ≤ m ≤ 50). It creates `n` Bottle instances and `m` Cup instances, then attempts to fill the cups from the bottles. If a cup is full or if there are no more bottles with contents left to fill, it returns an empty list. If all cups are successfully filled, it returns a list of ingredients from each cup. However, due to the potential for early returns when a cup is full or when there are insufficient bottles, the function may frequently return an empty list instead of a list of ingredients.
