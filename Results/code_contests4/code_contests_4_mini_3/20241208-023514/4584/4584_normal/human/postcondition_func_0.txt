The function accepts a parameter `x` and checks if `x` is less than a variable `eps`. It returns True if `x` is less than `eps` or if `x` is negative and its absolute value (i.e., `-x`) is less than `eps`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and not less than `eps`, it returns False. This means the function effectively evaluates whether `x` is within a certain proximity to zero defined by `eps`.
