The function reads three lines of input representing a 3x3 matrix of characters ('X' or '.') and evaluates specific conditions based on the positions of 'X'. If any of the specified conditions involving 'X' are true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. It assumes that the input is always a valid 3x3 matrix formatted as three strings of three characters each.
