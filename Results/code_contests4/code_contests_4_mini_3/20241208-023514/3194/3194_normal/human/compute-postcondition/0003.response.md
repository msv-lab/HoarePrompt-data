According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. The loop can execute again as `i` (1) is still less than 3.

State: **`lines` contains one input line, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 3**
