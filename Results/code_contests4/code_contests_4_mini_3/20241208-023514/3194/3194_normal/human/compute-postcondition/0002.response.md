The code `lines.append(sys.stdin.readline())` appends a line read from standard input to the list `lines`. Since `lines` is initially an empty list, after executing this line, `lines` will contain one element, which is the input line read from standard input. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `lines` contains one input line, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`lines` contains one input line, `i` is 0**
