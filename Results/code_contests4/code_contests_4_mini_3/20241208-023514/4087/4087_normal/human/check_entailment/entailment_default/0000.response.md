To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Description

The problem requires calculating the number of different subsequences of a given integer sequence of length \( n+1 \) with all integers from 1 to \( n \) appearing at least once. For each integer \( k=1,...,n+1 \), we need to find the number of different subsequences of length \( k \), modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the Program

The provided program appears to:
1. Read the integer \( n \) and the sequence \( a \).
2. Create a list of factorials up to \( n+1 \).
3. Use indices of the first occurrence and the next occurrence of elements to compute the number of subsequences of different lengths.

However, the logic of calculating subsequences seems flawed:
- The program uses `a.index(a[i])` which only finds the first occurrence of `a[i]`. If there are duplicates, it may not correctly find the second occurrence.
- The use of `pow[left + n - right]` assumes that the computation of the number of subsequences relies solely on these indices, which may not capture all valid subsequences correctly.
- The handling of subsequences and the values of `ans` and `x` may lead to unexpected results based on the arrangement of duplicates in the input.

### Step 3: Output Hints Analysis

The output hints indicate that:
- The function prints a series of values based on the factorial of indices and the presence of duplicate elements in \( a \).
- The function does not return any value and prints the results directly.

However, the hints also describe how the program calculates the results based on the first and duplicate occurrences of elements, which may not give correct results for all cases.

### Step 4: Identify Edge Cases

1. **Single Element Repeated**: For input `1 1`, the expected output is `1` for both lengths `1` and `2`. The provided logic should return this correctly.
2. **Multiple Duplicates**: For `3 1 2 1 3`, the expected counts for subsequences may not be accurately calculated since the program logic relies on the first and next occurrences rather than all combinations.

### Conclusion

The program does not appear to correctly account for all subsequences based on the input conditions. The reliance on specific indices to determine counts may miss valid subsequences formed by duplicates.

Correctness: **False**.

**Reason**: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases due to its flawed logic regarding the counting of subsequences, especially where duplicates are involved, which is essential for determining subsequences correctly.
