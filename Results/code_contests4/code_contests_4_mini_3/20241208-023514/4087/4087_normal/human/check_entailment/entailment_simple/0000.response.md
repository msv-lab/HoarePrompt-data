Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly addressing the problem description. Let's break down the reasons:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the factorial values for numbers up to `n + 1` using the line `pow = [0] * n + 2`, which is incorrect. This line creates a list of size `n` and does not allocate space for `n + 2` elements as intended. The correct initialization should be `pow = [0] * (n + 2)`.

2. **Integer Division and Modulo**: The program uses `/` for division, which in Python 2 performs integer division when both operands are integers. This could lead to incorrect results when calculating combinations. Python 3 uses `//` for integer division and `/` for float division, and the program should ensure that any division involving large numbers is correctly handled and that results remain integers. Additionally, the final output should be computed as `(ans - x) % mask` properly, but the use of `%` is applied incorrectly in the `print` statement.

3. **Subsequence Calculation**: The logic to calculate the number of different subsequences of length `k` is flawed. The program attempts to find duplicates and uses indices `left` and `right` to adjust the counts, but this approach does not correctly enumerate all combinations of subsequences. The mathematical formulation for counting combinations (n choose k) must be precisely calculated based on the given sequence, taking into account the repetitions and constraints defined in the problem.

4. **Output Format**: The output should be `n + 1` lines corresponding to the counts of different subsequences of length `1` to `n + 1`. The current implementation does not ensure that it adheres to this requirement correctly.

In summary, the program fails to correctly initialize data structures, handle division appropriately, and implement the correct logic for counting distinct subsequences, leading to an incorrect solution that does not satisfy the problem requirements.
