Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: The program attempts to compute the factorials up to `n + 1` and store them in the list `pow`. While this is a reasonable step, the way it is used later in computations is incorrect.

2. **Subsequence Count**: The problem requires calculating the number of distinct subsequences of length `k` for each `k` from `1` to `n + 1`. The formula used in the program (`ans` and `x`) does not correctly calculate the number of distinct subsequences based on the requirements of the problem. Specifically:
   - The variable `ans` is calculated using a combination formula, but without considering the distinct elements properly.
   - The variable `x` is derived based on `left` and `right`, which are determined by finding duplicates in the array. This approach does not align with the requirement for counting distinct subsequences.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The program performs the modulo operation incorrectly. The expression `print(ans - x) % mask` will not produce the correct result if `ans` is less than `x`, as it will yield a negative number before the modulo operation, which isn't handled correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle certain edge cases, such as when `n = 1`, where the sequence will have a specific structure (e.g., [1, 1]) that might not be accounted for properly with the current logic.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints all results in one loop without ensuring that the counts for all lengths from `1` to `n + 1` are computed correctly according to the subsequences of length `k`.

In conclusion, the logic for determining the number of distinct subsequences does not follow the combinatorial requirements needed to solve the problem as described. The errors in computation and the method of handling duplicates indicate that the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements for every potential case.
