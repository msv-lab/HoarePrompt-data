You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an integer sequence of length n+1, a_1,a_2,...,a_{n+1}, which consists of the n integers 1,...,n. It is known that each of the n integers 1,...,n appears at least once in this sequence.

For each integer k=1,...,n+1, find the number of the different subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

* 1 \leq n \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_i \leq n
* Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence.
* n and a_i are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


n
a_1 a_2 ... a_{n+1}


Output

Print n+1 lines. The k-th line should contain the number of the different subsequences of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n+1 where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n and all integers from 1 to n appear at least once in the list.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, re.split('\\s', raw_input()))
    left = 0
    right = 0
    mask = 10 ** 9 + 7
    pow = [0] * n + 2
    tmp = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 2):
        tmp *= i
        
        pow[i] = tmp
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for 1 <= `i` <= `n + 1`, `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`.
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        x = a.index(a[i])
        
        if a[i] in a[x + 1:]:
            left = i
            right = a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `left` is the index of the first occurrence of an element in list `a` that has a subsequent duplicate, or remains 0 if no such element exists; `right` is the index of that duplicate occurrence if found, or remains 0 if no duplicates exist; `i` is the value of the last index checked (which will be `n` if no duplicates are found).
    for i in range(1, n + 2):
        ans = pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])
        
        x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])
        
        print(ans - x) % mask
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is `n + 1`; `ans` is calculated based on `pow[n + 1]`, `pow[i]`, and `pow[n + 1 - i]`; `x` is calculated based on `pow[left + n - right]`, `pow[i - 1]`, and `pow[left + n - right - i + 1]`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
