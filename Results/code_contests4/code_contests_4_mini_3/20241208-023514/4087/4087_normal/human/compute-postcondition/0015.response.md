The value of `pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is 6. The previous value of `pow[3]` is not mentioned, but it is overwritten by 6. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `pow[3]` is 6, `tmp` is 6, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `pow[3]` is 6, `tmp` is 6, `i` is 3**
