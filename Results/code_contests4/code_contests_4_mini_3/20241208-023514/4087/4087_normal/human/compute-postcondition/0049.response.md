To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the structure of the loop and the variables involved.

The loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute `n + 1` times if `n` is a positive integer. During each iteration, the values of `i`, `ans`, and `x` are calculated based on the current index `i`, and the results are printed. 

1. The variable `i` will take on values from 1 to `n + 1`, ultimately resulting in `i` being `n + 1` after the last iteration.
2. The variable `ans` is calculated as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`, which will be evaluated during each iteration. After the final iteration, it will be calculated for `i = n + 1`.
3. The variable `x` is calculated as `pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])`, which is also evaluated during each iteration. After the last iteration, it will be calculated for `i = n + 1`.
4. The result of `(ans - x) % mask` will be printed during each iteration, but ultimately, the values of `left`, `right`, `ans`, and `x` will depend on the specific values of `pow`, `left`, and `right`.

If the loop executes `n + 1` times, we can summarize the final output state after all iterations:

- `n` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- The final values of `ans` and `x` depend on the calculations performed during the last iteration, influenced by `left`, `right`, and the `pow` array.
- The results of the computations during the last iteration have been printed, but the exact value is not retained in the state.

Taking all this into account, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is `n + 1`; `ans` is calculated based on `pow[n + 1]`, `pow[i]`, and `pow[n + 1 - i]`; `x` is calculated based on `pow[left + n - right]`, `pow[i - 1]`, and `pow[left + n - right - i + 1]`.**
