Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `left` is the index of the first occurrence of an element in list `a` that has a subsequent duplicate, or remains 0 if no such element exists; `right` is the index of that duplicate occurrence if found, or remains 0 if no duplicates exist; `i` is the value of the last index checked (which will be `n` if no duplicates are found).**
