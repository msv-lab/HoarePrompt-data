The variable `left` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 1; `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in the array `a`; `left` is 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 1; `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in the array `a`; `left` is 1**.
