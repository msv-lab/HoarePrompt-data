According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop is set to execute for `i` ranging from 1 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^5`, which remains valid since `i` is now 2 and is still within the specified range of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
