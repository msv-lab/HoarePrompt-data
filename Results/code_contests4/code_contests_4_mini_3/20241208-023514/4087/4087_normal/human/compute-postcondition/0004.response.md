The variable `mask` is assigned the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which evaluates to `1000000007`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; `mask` is 1000000007.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; `mask` is 1000000007**.
