To analyze the impact of the code on the program, we check the variables involved:

1. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000.
2. `i` is initialized to 1.
3. `ans` is defined as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[1] * pow[n])`.

The code updates the variable `x` with the following formula:
```
x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])
```

Before executing this line:
- The value of `i` is 1.
- We need to check the values of `left` and `right` to proceed with the calculation of `x`.

However, we have no specific values for `left` and `right`, thus we cannot calculate a specific numerical value for `x`. 

The affected variables are `x` and `ans`, but since we cannot determine `x` without values for `left` and `right`, we can only describe the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 1; `ans` is calculated as pow[n + 1] / (pow[1] * pow[n]); `x` is calculated as pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])**.
