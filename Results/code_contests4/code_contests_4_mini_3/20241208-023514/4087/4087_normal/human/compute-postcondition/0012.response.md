`pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is 2. The previous value of `pow[1]` is 1, and all other elements of the `pow` array are 0. The value of `i` is 2, so now `pow[2]` will be updated to 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `tmp` is 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `tmp` is 2, `i` is 2**
