The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 1; `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in the array `a`; `left` is 1; `right` is the index of `a[i]` in the subarray `a[x + 1:]` adjusted by `x + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
