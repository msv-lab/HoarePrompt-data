The variable `a` is assigned the result of `map(int, re.split('\\s', raw_input()))`, which processes the input from `raw_input()`, splitting it by whitespace and converting each split string into an integer. The length of `a` will be `n + 1` based on the initial state, and since all integers from 1 to `n` appear at least once in the list, the output state will reflect that `a` now contains a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` created from the input values.**
