Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 2; `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in list `a`. If `a[i]` is found in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, then `right` is computed as the index of `a[i]` in that sublist adjusted by `x + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
