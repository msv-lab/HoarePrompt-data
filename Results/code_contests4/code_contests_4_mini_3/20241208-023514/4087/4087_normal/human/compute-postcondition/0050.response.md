The function `func` does not take any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates based on two implicit constraints: `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `a`, which is a list of integers of length \(n+1\). Each integer \(a_i\) in the list satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and all integers from 1 to \(n\) appear in the list at least once.

Based on the output specifications provided, the function handles the input data and returns a value that is derived from the relationship between `n` and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an implicit positive integer n and a list of integers a of length n+1, where each integer in a satisfies the given constraints, and returns a value based on the processing of these inputs.**
