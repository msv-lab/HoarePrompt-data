To simulate the execution of the given Python code, we will analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is calculated as \(\frac{(n + 1)}{(3) \times (n - 1)}\)

The code snippet provided is:
```
x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])
```

Now, let's break down the operation:

1. The expression involves `pow` which seems to be used as a function or a list. However, without specific values for `left`, `right`, or the contents of `pow`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `x`.
2. The variable `x` is assigned a value based on the computation involving `n` and `i`, but since `left` and `right` are not defined, we cannot determine the actual output for `x`.
3. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Given these considerations, we cannot provide a specific numeric output for `x`. However, we can state that the computation involves `n` and `i` in the formula for `x`.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the uncertainty regarding `left` and `right` but acknowledges the relationship with `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 3; `x` is calculated based on undefined variables `left` and `right`.**
