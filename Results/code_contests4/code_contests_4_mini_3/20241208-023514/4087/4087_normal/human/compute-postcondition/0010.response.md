According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1` (inclusive) since it is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 2)`. Given that `i` is currently 1 at the end of the last iteration, and since the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2 in the next iteration. The loop can continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. 

Thus, to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to 2. Additionally, `n` must be a positive integer such that it allows for `i` to be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), this condition naturally holds.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `tmp` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5**
