According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `0` to `n + 1`, which means it will run as long as `n` is a positive integer within the specified bounds. Since `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), the loop will execute.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to `0`. The other provided states (`a`, `left`, `right`, `mask`, `pow`, and `tmp`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as they do not influence the range or initial conditions for `i`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `i` is initialized to `0`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
