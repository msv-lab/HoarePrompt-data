In the provided code snippet, `ans` is assigned the value of the expression `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`. Here, `pow` typically refers to the exponentiation function. The variables involved are `n` and `i`.

1. The value of `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000.
2. The value of `i` is fixed at 2.
3. The expression involves calculating the power of numbers, which are derived from `n` and `i`.

Calculating the values step by step:
- `n + 1` will yield values from 2 to 100,001.
- `pow[n + 1]` computes the result of raising some base to the power of `n + 1`.
- `pow[i]` computes the result of raising some base to the power of 2 (which is 4 for base 2).
- `pow[n + 1 - i]` computes the result of raising some base to the power of `n - 1` (which varies with `n`).

However, without specific values for `n`, we can only express `ans` in terms of `n` and `i`. As `n` determines the exact values of `ans`, we cannot specify an exact number for it. The value of `ans` will depend on the specific positive integer chosen for `n`.

Thus, the output state would indicate the relationship and calculation based on the values of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 2; `ans` is calculated as pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i]).**
