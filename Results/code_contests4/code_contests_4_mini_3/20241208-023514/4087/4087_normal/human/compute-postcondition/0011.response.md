`tmp` is multiplied by `i`, and since `tmp` is initially 1 and `i` is 2, after execution, `tmp` will be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `tmp` is 2, `i` is 2.
