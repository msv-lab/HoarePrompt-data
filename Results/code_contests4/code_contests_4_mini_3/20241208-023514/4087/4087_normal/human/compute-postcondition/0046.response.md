In the given code snippet, `ans` is assigned the value of `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`. The `pow` function is used here, which generally raises a number to the power of the given exponent. 

Given the initial values:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `i` is 3

To calculate `ans`, we need to evaluate `pow[n + 1]`, `pow[i]`, and `pow[n + 1 - i]`:

1. `pow[n + 1]` calculates \( (n + 1)^1 \) since the exponent is not specified, which is simply \( n + 1 \).
2. `pow[i]` calculates \( 3^1 \) which equals 3.
3. `pow[n + 1 - i]` calculates \( (n + 1 - 3)^1 \) which simplifies to \( n - 1 \).

Thus, `ans` is calculated as follows:
\[
ans = \frac{(n + 1)}{(3) \times (n - 1)}
\]

The output does not depend on the specific values of `n` beyond the conditions given, but it will be a fraction based on those calculations.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 3, and `ans` is calculated as \(\frac{(n + 1)}{(3) \times (n - 1)}\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 3, and `ans` is calculated as \(\frac{(n + 1)}{(3) \times (n - 1)}\)**.
