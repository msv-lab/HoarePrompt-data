The variable `left` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 2; `left` is 2; `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 2; `left` is 2; `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in list `a**
