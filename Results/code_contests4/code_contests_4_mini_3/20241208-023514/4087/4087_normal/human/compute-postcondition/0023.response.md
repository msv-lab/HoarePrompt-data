Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `x` is the index of the element `a[0]` in the list `a`, if `a[i]` is present in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, then `left` is set to 0, `right` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `a[x + 1:]` plus `x + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
