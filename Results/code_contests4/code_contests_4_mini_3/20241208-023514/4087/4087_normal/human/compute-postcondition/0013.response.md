According to the code, the loop is set to execute a total of `n + 1` times, starting from `i = 1` and going up to `i = n + 1`. Since `i` is currently 2 at the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed once for `i = 1` and once for `i = 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. 

At this point, the maximum value for `i` can be `n + 1`, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. 

Therefore, the updated state at the beginning of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `tmp` is 2, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1**.
