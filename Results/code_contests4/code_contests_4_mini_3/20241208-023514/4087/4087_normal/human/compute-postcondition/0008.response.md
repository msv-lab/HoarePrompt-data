The value of `tmp` is multiplied by `i`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is 1 and `i` is 1. After executing the code, `tmp` becomes 1 * 1 = 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of length `n + 2` filled with zeros, `tmp` is 1, `i` is 1**
