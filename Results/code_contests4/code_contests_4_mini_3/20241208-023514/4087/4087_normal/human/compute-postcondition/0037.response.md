According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` starting from 1 up to `n + 1`. The loop will iterate `n + 1` times, which means it will check values from 1 to `n + 1`. 

The relevant states that need to be considered are `n`, which must be a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and `i`, which will start at 1 for the first iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop will execute as long as `n` is within the specified range, we can conclude that the only necessary adjustments are to ensure that `i` is initialized correctly for the loop to begin.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
