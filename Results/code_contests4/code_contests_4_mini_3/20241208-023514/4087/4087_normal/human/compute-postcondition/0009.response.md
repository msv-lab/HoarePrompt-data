`pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is 1. The value of `i` is 1, so `pow[1]` is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `tmp` is 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `tmp` is 1, `i` is 1**
