Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 1; `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in the array `a`. If `a[i]` is found in the subarray `a[x + 1:]`, then `left` is set to 1, `right` is adjusted to the index of `a[i]` in that subarray, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
