To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5
- `i` is 2
- `left` is 2
- `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in list `a`

The code snippet:
```
right = a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is 2, this corresponds to the third element in `a`, denoted as `a[2]`.
2. `a[x + 1:]` creates a sublist of `a` starting from the index `x + 1` to the end of the list.
3. The `.index(a[i])` function searches for the first occurrence of the value `a[i]` within the sublist `a[x + 1:]`.
4. The result of `.index(a[i])` gives the index of `a[i]` in the sublist, which is then adjusted by adding `x + 1` to account for the index offset due to slicing.

### Variables Impact:
- The variable `right` is computed based on the position of `a[i]` relative to the sublist starting from `x + 1`. 
- The actual value of `right` depends on the content of the list `a` and the specific values of `x` and `i`.

Since we do not have specific values for `a`, `x`, or `a[i]`, we cannot compute a concrete numeric value for `right`. However, we know that `right` will be assigned a value based on the conditions described above.

### Conclusion:
Given the nature of the operations and without specific values from list `a`, we can describe the output state in terms of the relationships and computations that have occurred.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 2; `left` is 2; `x` is the index of the element at position `i` in list `a`; `right` is computed as the index of `a[i]` in the sublist `a[x + 1:]` adjusted by `x + 1`.**
