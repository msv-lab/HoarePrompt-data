According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which ranges from 0 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

Since the loop iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, it is sufficient to note that `n` remains unchanged. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 2 and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
