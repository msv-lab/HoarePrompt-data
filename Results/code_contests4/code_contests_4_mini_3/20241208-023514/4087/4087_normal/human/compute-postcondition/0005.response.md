The code initializes a list `pow` with a length of `n + 2`, filled with zeros. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. Thus, the length of the list `pow` will be `n + 2`, which ranges from 3 to 100,002, depending on the value of `n`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of length `n + 2` filled with zeros.**
