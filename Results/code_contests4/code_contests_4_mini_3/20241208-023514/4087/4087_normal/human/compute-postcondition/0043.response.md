Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 2; `ans` is calculated as pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i]).

```
x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `x` is assigned a value based on the formula provided.
2. The computation for `x` involves `pow[left + n - right]`, `pow[i - 1]`, and `pow[left + n - right - i + 1]`.
3. The variables `left`, `right`, and `n` are involved in the calculation but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, `x` is dependent on those values.
4. The previous values of `i` and `n` are known, with `i` being 2 and `n` being a positive integer within the defined range.

Since the exact values of `left` and `right` are not specified, we cannot calculate a specific numerical value for `x`. Thus, we can only describe the relationship and dependencies.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 2; `x` is calculated as pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])**.
