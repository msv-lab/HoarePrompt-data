According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1. This means that `i` will become 3. Since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^5`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (because `i` will become 3 and must be less than or equal to `n + 1`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
