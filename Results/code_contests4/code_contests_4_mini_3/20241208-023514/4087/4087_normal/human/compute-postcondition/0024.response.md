According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 0 and going up to `n`. If the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, it must still satisfy the condition `i <= n`. 

Thus, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
