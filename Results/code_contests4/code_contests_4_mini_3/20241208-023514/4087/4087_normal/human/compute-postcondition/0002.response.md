The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The initial state of `n` and `a` is not affected by this assignment, as `left` is a new variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`; `left` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`; `left` is 0**
