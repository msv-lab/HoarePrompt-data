The expression `ans = pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])` involves calculating the value of `ans` based on the values of `n` and `i`. 

In this case:
- `pow[n + 1]` is the value of the function `pow` at `n + 1`.
- `pow[i]` is the value of the function `pow` at `i`, which is currently 1.
- `pow[n + 1 - i]` is the value of the function `pow` at `n + 1 - 1`, simplifying to `pow[n]`.

Since `i` is 1, the calculation simplifies to:
```
ans = pow[n + 1] / (pow[1] * pow[n])
```

The specific values of `pow[n + 1]`, `pow[1]`, and `pow[n]` depend on the mathematical definition of the `pow` function, but generally, if we assume `pow` to be the power function, we can interpret `pow[x]` as `x^2` (for example).

Thus, the output state will reflect these calculations without specific numeric results since the values depend on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `i` is 1; `ans` is calculated as pow[n + 1] / (pow[1] * pow[n])**
