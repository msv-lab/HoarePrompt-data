The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n + 1`, where each integer in `a` is between 1 and `n` and all integers from 1 to `n` appear at least once. It calculates and prints a series of values based on the factorial of indices and the presence of duplicate elements in `a`. Specifically, it identifies the indices of the first occurrence and the duplicate occurrence of an element in `a`, and uses these to compute and print values derived from factorial calculations, modulated by a specific mask. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly.
