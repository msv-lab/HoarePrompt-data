Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly computing the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with lengths from 1 to n+1.

1. **Incorrect handling of subsequences**: The logic employed in the program to find subsequences is flawed. Specifically, it uses the `index` method to find the first occurrence of an element and then attempts to determine the right boundary for subsequences incorrectly. This may lead to incorrect calculations of subsequences because it does not correctly consider all possible combinations and does not correctly track indices.

2. **Division by zero and incorrect calculations**: There are potential cases where the program might end up trying to calculate the number of subsequences using the formula that involves division by `pow[i]` or `pow[n + 1 - i]`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, this will lead to division by zero or incorrect values.

3. **Modular arithmetic**: The program attempts to use modular arithmetic, but it does not handle it correctly in the division operations. Python does not support modular division directly, and the current method will not yield the correct results. 

4. **Output issues**: The output is calculated using `print(ans - x) % mask`, but this does not ensure that the value is non-negative before taking the modulo, which could lead to negative results.

5. **Edge cases not considered**: The program does not properly handle cases where the sequence has duplicates, which could result in fewer unique subsequences than calculated.

Given these issues and potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements, the program is incorrect. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
1 1 2 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
3
5
4
1
```
However, due to the flaws in the logic, the program might not return these correct values. 

Thus, it is clear that the program does not work as expected for all cases.
