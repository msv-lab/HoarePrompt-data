Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). 

### Issues Identified:
1. **Index Handling**: The program uses the `index` method to find the first occurrence of an element in the list, which can lead to incorrect calculations if there are duplicate values in the list. For example, if the input is `4 1 1 2 3`, the index of the second `1` will not be correctly considered.
   
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The logic does not properly account for cases where the subsequences could be formed without duplicates. For instance, when all elements are the same or there's a significant number of duplicates, the calculations will not yield the correct number of unique subsequences.
   
3. **Division with Integers**: The program uses integer division in a context that should be using modular arithmetic. Direct division could potentially lead to incorrect results or division by zero in edge cases.

4. **Output Calculation**: The way the results are computed and printed (with `print(ans - x) % mask`) may not handle negative values correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Example Case Failing:
For the input:
```
2
1 1 2
```
The expected output for k=1 would be `2` (subsequences: {1}, {2}), but the program's logic does not account for how many times `1` can be selected uniquely from the available indices.
