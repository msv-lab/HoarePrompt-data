The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j + 1])` attempts to add an element from `mtrx` at position `[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. The initial state specifies that `j` is equal to 2, which is greater than 1, so we can proceed with the addition to `frnds`. The values of `k`, `m`, and other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 1; an element from `mtrx[i][3]` is added to `frnds`.**
