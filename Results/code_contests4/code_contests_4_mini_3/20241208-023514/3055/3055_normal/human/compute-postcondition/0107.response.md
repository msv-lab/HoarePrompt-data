The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])` attempts to add an element from the matrix `mtrx` at the index `[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. The variable `j` is equal to `2`, so `j - 1` equals `1`. Therefore, the code will add `mtrx[i][1]` to `frnds`.

The previous state does not affect the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, or `i`, but it is important to note that `i` is less than `n`, which means `i` is a valid index for `mtrx`. Since there are no restrictions on `mtrx`, we assume `mtrx[i][1]` is accessible and can be added to `frnds`.

As a result, the output state reflects that an element from `mtrx[i][1]` is added to `frnds`. 

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `frnds` adds an element from `mtrx[i][1]`.**
