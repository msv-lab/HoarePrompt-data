According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `m` is greater than 1. Since `m` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`j` is 2, for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 2**
