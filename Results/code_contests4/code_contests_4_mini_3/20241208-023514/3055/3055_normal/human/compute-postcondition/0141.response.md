According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `m` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to run a second time.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
