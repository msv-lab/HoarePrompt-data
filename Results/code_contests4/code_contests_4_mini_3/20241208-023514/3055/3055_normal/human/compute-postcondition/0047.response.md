`j` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value was 2, the new value of `j` becomes 3. The values of `m` and `mtrx[k]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[2]**
