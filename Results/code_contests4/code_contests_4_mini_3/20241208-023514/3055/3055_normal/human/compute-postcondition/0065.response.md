Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. If `i + 1` is less than `n`, `frnds` has the elements from `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]` (if `j - 1 > 0`), and `mtrx[i][j + 1]` (if `j + 1 < m`), as well as the element from `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. Otherwise, `frnds` remains unchanged.***
