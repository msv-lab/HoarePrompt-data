The value of `i1` is False, which means `k[i1]` refers to `k[0]`. The value of `ii` is 1, so `k[ii]` refers to `k[1]`. The value of `iii` is 2, so `k[iii]` refers to `k[2]`. 

The variables `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values of `k[0]` and `k[1]` respectively, while `c` is assigned the string value of `k[2]`. The specific values of `k` and the resulting assignments to `n`, `m`, and `c` depend on the user input. The output state will reflect the assignments based on the user-provided list `k`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value of `k[1]`, `c` is the string value of `k[2]`**
