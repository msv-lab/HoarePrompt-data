The code `k = raw_input().split(' ')` assigns to `k` the result of calling `raw_input()`, which collects a string input from the user and then splits that string into a list based on spaces. The values of the other variables (`i1`, `ii`, `iii`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i1` is False, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2, and `k` is a list of strings obtained from user input.

Output State: **`i1` is False, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2, and `k` is a list of strings obtained from user input.**
