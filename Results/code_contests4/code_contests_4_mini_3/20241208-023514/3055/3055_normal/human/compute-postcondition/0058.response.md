The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])` adds the element at position `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. 

Given the initial state:
- `k` is equal to `n`
- `j` is 0
- `m` is greater than 0
- `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'
- `i` is greater than 1, then `frnds` has the element at position `mtrx[i - 1][j]` added (this is a condition that is already satisfied)
- `j` is greater than 1

Since `j` is greater than 1, `j - 1` will result in a valid index. The value that will be added to `frnds` is `mtrx[i][j - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged since this operation only affects `frnds`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', `frnds` has the element at position `mtrx[i - 1][j]` added, and now `frnds` has the element at position `mtrx[i][j - 1]` added.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', `frnds` has the element at position `mtrx[i - 1][j]` added, and `frnds` has the element at position `mtrx[i][j - 1]` added.**
