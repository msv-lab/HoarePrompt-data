According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute at least once. The loop variable `j` will start at 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `m`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `m`, which means that after the first execution, `j` will be 1. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute a second time are:
- `j` is now 1 after the first execution.
- `m` remains greater than 0 to ensure that there are still iterations left, which is already satisfied as per the initial state.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n`**
