The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but it is increased by 1 regardless. The values of `j` and `mtrx[k]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`j` is `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `k` is increased by 1**
