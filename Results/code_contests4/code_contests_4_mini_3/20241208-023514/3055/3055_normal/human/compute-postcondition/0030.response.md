The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `j` is 1, after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[1]`, and `m` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[1]`, and `m` is greater than 1**
