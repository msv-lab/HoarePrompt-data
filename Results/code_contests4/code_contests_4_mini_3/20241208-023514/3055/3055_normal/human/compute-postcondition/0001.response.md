`ii` is assigned the result of the expression `False or 1`. The value of `False` is equivalent to 0, and in a logical OR operation, the first truthy value is returned. Since 1 is truthy, `ii` will be assigned the value 1. The value of `i1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`i1` is assigned the value `False` (or 0); `ii` is 1**
