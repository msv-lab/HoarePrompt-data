Given the code and the initial state provided, the loop is dependent on the value of `n`. Since `n` is initially set to 0, the outer loop will not execute at all. Consequently, the values of `k`, `j`, `mtrx`, and `frnds` will remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `mtrx` remains a list containing 0 empty lists if `n` was 0, or has been extended by elements from `col` if `n` was greater than 0, and `frnds` remains an empty set.**
