Functionality: ** The function processes an office-room layout defined by dimensions `n` and `m`, and a specified color `c`. It collects unique characters adjacent to occurrences of `c` in the layout, excluding the period character ('.'). Finally, it prints the count of these unique characters. The function does not take parameters directly; instead, it relies on user input for its operation. If the layout is empty or if no valid adjacent characters are found, it will return 0. Additionally, it does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are 0 effectively, as the logic assumes positive values for both. **
