Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', if `j - 1 > 0`, `frnds` has the element at position `mtrx[i - 1][j]` and the element at position `mtrx[i][j - 1]` added, otherwise `frnds` remains unchanged; if `j + 1` is less than `m`, `frnds` now also includes the element at `mtrx[i][j + 1]`.***
