The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but it will now be one unit higher. The states of the other variables (`j`, `n`, `col`, and `mtrx[k]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `m`, `n` is 0, `col` is an input string, and `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `n` is 0, `col` is an input string, and `k` is increased by 1.**
