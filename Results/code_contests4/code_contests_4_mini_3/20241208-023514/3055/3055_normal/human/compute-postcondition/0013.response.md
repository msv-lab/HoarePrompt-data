The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `col` is an input string, `j` is 1, and `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `col` is an input string, `j` is 1, and `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[0]**
