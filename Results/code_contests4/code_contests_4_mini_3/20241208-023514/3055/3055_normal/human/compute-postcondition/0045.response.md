According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1. Since `m` is currently greater than 0, but not necessarily greater than 1, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is indeed greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 2**
