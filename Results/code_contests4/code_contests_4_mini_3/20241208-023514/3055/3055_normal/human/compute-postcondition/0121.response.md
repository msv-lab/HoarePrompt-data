The code attempts to add an element to `frnds` from `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. The previous state indicates that `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 3, and `m` is greater than 2. However, we do not have details about the values of `i` and `mtrx`, so we cannot determine if the addition is valid or what the exact value added to `frnds` would be.

Since the only operation performed is adding `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to `frnds`, and we donâ€™t have information about `mtrx` or the values it holds, we can conclude that the state of `k`, `j`, and `m` remains unchanged, and we are adding an unspecified value from `mtrx` to `frnds`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 2, and an element is added to `frnds` from `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.**
