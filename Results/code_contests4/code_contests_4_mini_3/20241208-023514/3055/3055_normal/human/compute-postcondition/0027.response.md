The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The state of `mtrx[k]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, and `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[0]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[0]**
