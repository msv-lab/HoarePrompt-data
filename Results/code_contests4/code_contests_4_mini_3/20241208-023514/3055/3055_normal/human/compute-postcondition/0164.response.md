The code `frnds.remove('.')` attempts to remove the element `'.'` from the set `frnds`. Since `'.'` is stated to be an element of `frnds`, this operation will succeed, and `frnds` will no longer contain the `'.'` element. The other variables (`k`, `j`, `m`, `mtrx`) remain unaffected as the operation only alters the contents of `frnds`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `mtrx` remains a list containing 0 empty lists if `n` was 0, or has been extended by elements from `col` if `n` was greater than 0, `frnds` is an empty set after removing '.'**
