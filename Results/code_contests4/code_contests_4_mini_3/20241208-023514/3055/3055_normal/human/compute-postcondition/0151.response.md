According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `m` is greater than 1, `j` can be incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2. 

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
