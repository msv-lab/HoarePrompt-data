To determine if the `while` loop will execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `j < m`. The variables provided are `j`, `k`, `n`, and `col`.

1. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `j` is 0,
   - `k` is increased by 1,
   - `n` must be greater than `k`,
   - `col` is an input string.

2. **Loop condition**: The loop will execute if `j < m`. 

Given that `j` is currently 0, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. 

3. **Understanding `k` and `n`**: 
   - The condition states that `n` must be greater than `k`. Since `k` is increased by 1, we can assume `k` is at least 1 (k â‰¥ 1).
   - This means `n` must be greater than `k`, which implies \( n > 1 \).

4. **Conclusion**: 
   - Since the only requirement for `j < m` to be satisfied initially is for `m` to be greater than `j`, and `j` is 0, we need `m` to be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m`, which must be greater than `j`.

State: **`j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `m` must be greater than 0**
