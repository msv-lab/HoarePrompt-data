According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been increased by 1 and `n` is 0. Since `k` being greater than or equal to `n` (which is 0) means the loop cannot execute again, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `k` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `k` is equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than whatever value `k` has reached.

State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `n` is 0, `col` is an input string, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `k`**
