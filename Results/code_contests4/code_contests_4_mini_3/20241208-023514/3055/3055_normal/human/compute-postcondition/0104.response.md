According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range of `m`. Given that `j` is currently 1 and the loop iterates over a range defined by `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and to execute the loop for a third time, `j` should become 2. Also, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `i` is less than `n`.**
