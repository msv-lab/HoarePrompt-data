The value of `j` is assigned to 0. This directly affects the variable `j`, changing it from its previous value (which was equal to `m`) to 0. The values of `k`, `n`, and `col` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `k` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `k`, and `col` is an input string.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `k` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `k`, and `col` is an input string.**
