Output State: **`j` is `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `mtrx[k]` is extended with all elements from `col` up to `col[m-1]` (if `m` was initially greater than `0`, and `col` has at least `m` elements). If `m` was initially 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `j` remains 0, and `mtrx[k]` remains unchanged.**
