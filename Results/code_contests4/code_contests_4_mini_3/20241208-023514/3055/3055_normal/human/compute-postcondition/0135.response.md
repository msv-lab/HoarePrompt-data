The code snippet adds the element at position `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. The previous state indicates the following:

- `k` is equal to `n`
- `j` is 0
- `m` is greater than 0
- `i` is `i + 1`
- The element at `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'
- `frnds` currently includes the element `mtrx[i][j - 1]` if `j - 1` is greater than 0
- `j + 1` is less than `m`

Since `j` is currently 0, `j + 1` is 1, and the condition `j + 1 < m` holds true because `m` is greater than 0. Thus, the element `mtrx[i][1]` will be added to the `frnds` set.

The output state will reflect that `frnds` now includes the element `mtrx[i][1]`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `frnds` now includes the element `mtrx[i][1]`**.
