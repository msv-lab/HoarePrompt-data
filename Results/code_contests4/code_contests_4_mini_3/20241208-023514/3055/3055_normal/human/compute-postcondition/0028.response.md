According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` needs to be greater than 1, since `j` is currently 1. 

State: **`j` is 1, for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 1**
