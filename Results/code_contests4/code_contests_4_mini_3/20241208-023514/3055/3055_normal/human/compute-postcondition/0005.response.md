The code `mtrx = [[] for _ in range(n)]` creates a list of empty lists. The variable `n` determines how many empty lists will be created in the outer list. The values of `m` and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Since `n` is the integer value of `k[0]`, the output state will reflect that `mtrx` is now a list containing `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value of `k[1]`, `c` is the string value of `k[2]`, `mtrx` is a list containing `n` empty lists**
