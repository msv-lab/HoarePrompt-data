According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is 0, but we don't have a value for `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `m`. 

State: **`n` is 0, `col` is an input string, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` must be greater than 0**
