The code attempts to add `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to `frnds`. The value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2. The previous condition regarding `j - 1` does not affect this operation since we're adding a value from the matrix to `frnds`. The initial state indicates that `m` is greater than 1, but this does not directly influence the addition to `frnds`. The output state reflects the potential change to `frnds` without any changes to `k`, `j`, or `m`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, and `frnds` is updated by adding `mtrx[i][2]`.**
