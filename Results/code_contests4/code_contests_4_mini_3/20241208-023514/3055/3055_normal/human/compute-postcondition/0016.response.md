The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `col` is an input string, `j` is 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `col` is an input string, `j` is 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[1]**
