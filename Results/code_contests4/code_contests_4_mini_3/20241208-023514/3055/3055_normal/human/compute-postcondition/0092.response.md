The code adds the value from `mtrx[i - 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. The variable `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, and the conditions allow us to access `mtrx[i - 1][j]` safely since `i - 1` is greater than 0. The exact value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is not provided, but it is assumed to be a valid entry (not equal to '.'). The values of `k`, `j`, `m`, and `i` do not change, and the set `frnds` will now include the value from `mtrx[i - 1][j]`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, the element `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, `mtrx[i][j]` is not equal to '.', `i - 1` is greater than 0, and `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i - 1][j]`.**
