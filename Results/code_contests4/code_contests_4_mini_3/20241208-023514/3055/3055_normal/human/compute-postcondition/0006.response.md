The variable `frnds` is assigned an empty set, which initializes it as a set with no elements. The values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, and `mtrx`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value of `k[1]`, `c` is the string value of `k[2]`, `mtrx` is a list containing `n` empty lists, and `frnds` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value of `k[1]`, `c` is the string value of `k[2]`, `mtrx` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `frnds` is an empty set**
