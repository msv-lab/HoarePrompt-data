According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `j` is equal to `m`, which means that the loop will not execute because the range will be from `0` to `m-1`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n`, and `j` should be reset to `0` before the loop starts. 

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` must be greater than 0**
