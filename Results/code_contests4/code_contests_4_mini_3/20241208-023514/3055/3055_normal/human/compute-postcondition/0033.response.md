`j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3; `m` is greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended with elements from `col[2]`, the exact elements of which are unknown.

Output State: **`j` is 3; `m` is greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended with elements from `col[2]`, the exact elements of which are unknown.**
