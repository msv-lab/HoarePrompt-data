According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. However, since `m` is greater than 0, it does not guarantee that the loop can execute again, as `m` must also be greater than `1` to allow `j` (which is currently 1) to be less than `m` for the next iteration.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `m` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `1`.

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 1**
