The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i - 1][j])` adds an element to the set `frnds` from the matrix `mtrx` at the position `[i - 1][j]`. The initial state indicates that `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1, which implies that the loop is executing. However, since the values of `i` and `mtrx` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific value being added to `frnds`.

The states of `k`, `j`, and `m` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that an element from the matrix is being added to the set, but we cannot specify what that element is due to the lack of information about `i` and `mtrx`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, and an element from `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is added to `frnds`.**
