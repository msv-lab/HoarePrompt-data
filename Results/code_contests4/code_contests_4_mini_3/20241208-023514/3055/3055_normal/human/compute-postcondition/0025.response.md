According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `m`. Right before the loop, `j` is 0, and `n` is 0, but the critical variable here is `m`, which is not directly given. Since `j` was previously equal to `m`, for the loop to execute at least one time, `m` must be greater than `j` at this moment. Therefore, `m` must be adjusted to be greater than 0. 

State: **`j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `m` must be greater than 0**
