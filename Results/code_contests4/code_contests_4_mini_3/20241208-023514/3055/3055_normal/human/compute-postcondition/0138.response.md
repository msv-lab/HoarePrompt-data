The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])` adds the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i + 1` is less than `n`. This indicates that the access to `mtrx[i + 1][j]` is valid since `i + 1` is within the bounds of the array/matrix.

The existing state of `frnds` will change because an element is added to it. The exact value added is determined by the content of `mtrx` at the specified indices.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]` is added to `frnds`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `frnds` includes the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]`**
