The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j + 1])` attempts to add the value from the matrix `mtrx` at the position `[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. The variable `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3. Since `m` is greater than 2, and `j - 1` is greater than 0, we can conclude that the code will execute without any issues related to `j`.

However, we do not have the specific values for `i` or the contents of `mtrx`, so we cannot determine the exact value that will be added to `frnds`. Therefore, we can state that `frnds` will be updated with a value from `mtrx[i][3]`, but we cannot specify what that value is.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2; `frnds` is updated with the value from `mtrx[i][3]`**.
