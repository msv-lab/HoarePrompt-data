The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])` adds the value from the matrix `mtrx` at the position `[i + 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. The previous values of `k`, `j`, and `m` do not affect this specific operation, but we must ensure that the access to `mtrx[i + 1][j]` is valid.

Since `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, it is logical to assume that `j` is within the bounds of the matrix `mtrx`. As `k` is equal to `n`, it does not influence the outcome of the operation either.

Thus, assuming valid indices, the output state indicates that an element has been added to `frnds`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and an element from `mtrx[i + 1][j]` has been added to `frnds`.**
