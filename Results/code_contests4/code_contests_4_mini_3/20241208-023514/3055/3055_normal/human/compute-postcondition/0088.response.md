According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` compared to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `n`, which means `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to run again. Since `j` is `m`, and `m` is greater than 0, the next iteration will increment `i` by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to `n`, and `frnds` will remain as is, depending on the conditions met during the last iteration.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n`**
