The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])` adds the value from the matrix `mtrx` at position `[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. The variable `j` is equal to 2, so `j - 1` is 1. The variable `m` is greater than 2, and the status of `k`, `n`, and `m` is not changed by this operation. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but for the code to execute, `i - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `i` is at least 2.

The output state reflects that `frnds` is updated with the value from `mtrx[i][1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `frnds` is updated with the value of `mtrx[i][1]**.
