Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `frnds` includes elements from `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, and `mtrx[i + 1][j]` for each valid index, given that `mtrx[i][j]` was equal to `c` and not equal to '.' during the iterations. If no such conditions were met, `frnds` remains an empty set.**
