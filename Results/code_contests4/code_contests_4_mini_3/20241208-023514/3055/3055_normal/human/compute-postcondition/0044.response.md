The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables, `m` and `mtrx[k]`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[1]`, and for the loop to execute again, `m` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[1]`, and for the loop to execute again, `m` is greater than 1.**
