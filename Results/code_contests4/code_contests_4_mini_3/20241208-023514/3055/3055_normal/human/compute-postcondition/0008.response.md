According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `n` is 0, thus for the loop to execute at least once, `n` needs to be greater than 0. Additionally, `k` must also be adjusted to ensure it is less than `n`. We don't have a specific value for `k`, but if `k` is initially less than 0, that would allow the loop to execute since `n` is 0.

State: **`n` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 0 and `k` must be less than `n`**
