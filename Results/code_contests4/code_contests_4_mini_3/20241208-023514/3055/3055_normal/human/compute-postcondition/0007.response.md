The variable `k` is assigned the value of `int(False)`, which evaluates to `0`. Consequently, `n` and `m` will be updated since they are defined in terms of `k`. `n` will take the value of `k[0]`, which is `0`, and `m` will take the value of `k[1]`, which is also `0`. The string `c` will take the value of `k[2]`, which does not have any specific definition here. The empty list `mtrx` will now contain `0` empty lists, and `frnds` will still be an empty set. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `c` is undefined, `mtrx` is a list containing 0 empty lists, and `frnds` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 0, `c` is undefined, `mtrx` is a list containing 0 empty lists, `frnds` is an empty set**
