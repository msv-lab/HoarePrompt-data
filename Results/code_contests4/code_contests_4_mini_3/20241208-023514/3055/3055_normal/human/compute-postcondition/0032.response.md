The code `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` extends the list `mtrx[k]` with the elements from `col[j]`. The variable `j` is 2, but the value of `m` has not been provided; however, it is stated that for the loop to execute again, `m` is greater than 2. The variable `k` is also unknown.

Since the value of `col[j]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact elements being extended to `mtrx[k]`. Other variables are not affected, and the state of `m`, `k`, and `col[j]` remains unknown.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2; `m` is greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended with elements from `col[2]`, the exact elements of which are unknown.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `m` is greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended with elements from `col[2]`, the exact elements of which are unknown.**
