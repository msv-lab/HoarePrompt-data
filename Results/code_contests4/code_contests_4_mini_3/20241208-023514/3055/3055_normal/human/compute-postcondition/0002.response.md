`iii` is assigned the value of `False or 2`. The expression evaluates to `2` because in a logical OR operation, if the first operand is `False` (or 0), the result is the second operand. The previous values of `i1` and `ii` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i1` is `False`, `ii` is `1`, and `iii` is `2`.

Output State: **`i1` is False, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2**
