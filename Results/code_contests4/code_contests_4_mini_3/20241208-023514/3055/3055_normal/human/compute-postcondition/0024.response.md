The variable `j` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `j` was equal to `m`, which is currently unknown. The other variables `n` and `col` remain unchanged, and the loop condition does not affect the assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is now 0, `n` is 0, `col` is an input string, and `j` was previously equal to `m`.

Output State: **`j` is now 0, `n` is 0, `col` is an input string, and `j` was previously equal to `m.**
