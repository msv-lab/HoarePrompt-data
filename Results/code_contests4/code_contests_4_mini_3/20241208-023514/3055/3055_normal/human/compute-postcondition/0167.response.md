The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on the constraints that `n` and `m` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, and `c` is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour. Additionally, the function processes an office-room layout represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, which consist of uppercase Latin letters or the period character ('.'). 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the exact return value cannot be determined without further details. 

Functionality: **The function operates on an office-room layout with specified dimensions and colour constraints but does not accept parameters directly and the return value is not specified.**
