To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Requirements:
1. The program must read the dimensions of the office-room (n, m) and the President's desk color (c).
2. It should then read the office-room layout, which consists of characters representing either desks (uppercase letters) or empty cells ('.').
3. The goal is to count how many unique desks (subordinates) are adjacent to the President's desk, which is represented by the color `c`. Two desks are considered adjacent if they share a side.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input` (which is Python 2 syntax; in Python 3, it should be `input()`) to read the dimensions and desk color.
   - It constructs a matrix `mtrx` to represent the office layout.

2. **Matrix Population**:
   - The program correctly populates the 2D list `mtrx` with the office layout.

3. **Counting Adjacent Desks**:
   - The program iterates through each cell in the matrix.
   - When it finds a cell matching the President's desk color `c`, it checks its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to see if they contain any desk (not '.') and adds them to the `frnds` set.
   - However, there is a logical issue with the conditions used to check for adjacency:
     - The conditions for checking adjacent cells should ensure that the indices do not go out of bounds. The current checks (`if i - 1 > 0`, etc.) will fail for the first row or column because it will skip checking the adjacency if the desk is located at the edge of the matrix.
     - They should instead be checked as `if i - 1 >= 0`, etc.

4. **Removing Empty Cells**:
   - The program attempts to remove any '.' from `frnds`, but this is unnecessary since '.' should not be added to `frnds` in the first place based on the adjacency checks.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the length of `frnds`, which is intended to be the count of unique desks adjacent to the President's desk.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the adjacency checks leading to potential incorrect results when the President's desk is located on the edge of the office-room matrix. 

**Example Case Where It Fails**:
If the input were:
```
2 2 A
A.
.B
```
The program would not count the desk 'B' as adjacent to 'A' since it incorrectly checks the bounds for adjacency.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
