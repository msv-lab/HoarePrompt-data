To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem requires us to identify the number of "bad price" days, where a day is considered bad if there exists a later day with a lower price. 

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    days = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                days += 1
                break
t = int(raw_input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    func_1(arr)
```

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Logic Error in Inner Loop**: The inner loop starts checking from `j = 1`, which means it does not compare the price of the current day `i` with prices on days before `i`. It should start from `j = i + 1` to ensure it only checks later days against the current day price. 

2. **Return Value Missing**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of bad days but does not return or print the result. Therefore, even if the logic were correct, the output would not be provided.

3. **Incorrect Counting**: The `break` statement is used after incrementing `days`, which means that if a later price is found to be lower, it counts one bad price and stops checking further days. This does not account for all possible lower prices after day `i`.

### Example Where Program Does Not Work Correctly:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
3 5 2 6 1
```

- For day 1 (price 3): Days 3 (2) and 5 (1) are lower, so it should count as bad.
- For day 2 (price 5): Day 3 (2) is lower, so it should count as bad.
- For day 3 (price 2): Day 5 (1) is lower, so it should count as bad.
- For day 4 (price 6): Days 5 (1) is lower, so it should count as bad.
- Day 5 (price 1): No later days, so it should not count.

The correct output should be `4` bad days, but given the program's logic, it may not count all the bad days accurately due to the aforementioned issues.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to count bad price days as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
