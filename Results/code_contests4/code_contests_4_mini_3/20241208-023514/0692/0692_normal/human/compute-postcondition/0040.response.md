Postcondition: ***`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, `days` is incremented by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i]` is not greater than `arr[j]`, `days` remains unchanged.***
