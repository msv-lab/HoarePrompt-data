The value of `days` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of other variables, `arr` and `j`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is 1, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, and the tuple at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the tuple at index `j` in `arr`.

Output State: **`days` is 1, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, and the tuple at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the tuple at index `j` in `arr`**
