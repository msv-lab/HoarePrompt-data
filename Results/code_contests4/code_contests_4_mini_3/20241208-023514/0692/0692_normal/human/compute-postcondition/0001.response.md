According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr` list. The loop iterates from 0 to `len(arr) - 2`, which means that `len(arr)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, the variable `days` is initialized to 0, but it does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

For the loop to be executed the first time, `arr` must contain at least 2 tuples. Thus, `i` should start at 0, and the loop will operate on the first tuple in `arr`.

State: **`days` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is 0**
