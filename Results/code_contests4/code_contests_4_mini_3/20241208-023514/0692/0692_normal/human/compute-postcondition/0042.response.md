The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. The state of `j` remains unchanged at 2. Since `arr` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute a second time, this condition is not directly affected by the operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i` plus 1; `j` is 2.

Output State: **`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i` plus 1; `j` is 2**
