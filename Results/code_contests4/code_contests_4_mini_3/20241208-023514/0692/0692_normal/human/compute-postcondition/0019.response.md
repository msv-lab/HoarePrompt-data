The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is not known, but it is stated that it is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. The other variables `arr`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, `j` is 2, `i` is unchanged, and `days` is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, `j` is 2, `i` is unchanged, `days` is increased by 1**
