According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr` list. If `arr` has at least 2 tuples, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is 1, and the loop is currently at `j = 1`. To execute the loop a second time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j = 2`. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 3 tuples.

State: **`days` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, and `j` is 2**
