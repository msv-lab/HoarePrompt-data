The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, `j` is 2, `i` is unchanged, `days` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
