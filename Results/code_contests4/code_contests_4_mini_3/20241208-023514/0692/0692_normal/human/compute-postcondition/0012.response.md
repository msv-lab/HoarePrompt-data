The value of `days` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The values of `arr` and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is 3, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`days` is 3, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `j` is 3**
