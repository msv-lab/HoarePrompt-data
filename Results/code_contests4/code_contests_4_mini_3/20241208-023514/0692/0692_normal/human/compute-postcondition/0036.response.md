Postcondition: ***`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, where `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` has at least `len(arr)` tuples. If the tuple at index `i` is greater than the tuple at index `j` (which is 2), `days` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
