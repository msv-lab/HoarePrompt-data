The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. However, the specific value of `days` is not provided. The values of `j` and `arr` are not affected by this operation, but for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2 and the length of `arr` must be greater than 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is incremented by 1, and the loop condition remains valid with `j` being 2 and the length of `arr` greater than 2.

Output State: **`days` is incremented by 1; `j` is 2; length of `arr` is greater than 2**
