Postcondition: ***`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, then `days` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 2, and the loop terminates. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `days` or `j`, and the loop prepares for the next iteration.***
