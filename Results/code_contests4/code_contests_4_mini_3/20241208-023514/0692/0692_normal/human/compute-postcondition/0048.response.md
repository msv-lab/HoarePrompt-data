The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains an integer representing the number of days and a list of integers representing prices on those days. The function iterates through the list and counts how many tuples have a first element (days) that is less than any of the tuples preceding them, which is not accurately reflected in the annotations. 

However, there is a significant issue in the implementation: the nested loop incorrectly compares the entire tuple rather than the first element of each tuple, which means it does not perform the intended operation as described. 

Additionally, the outer loop iterates only up to `len(arr) - 1`, which means the last tuple is not considered in comparisons, and the inner loop starts at index 1, which may lead to incorrect behavior as it does not check all previous tuples for the first element. 

The function does not return any value, which is also a critical omission from the annotations. It simply modifies the local variable `days` without producing an output.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains an integer and a list of integers. It attempts to count how many tuples have a first element that is less than any of the tuples preceding them, but it does not correctly implement this logic and does not return a value. **
