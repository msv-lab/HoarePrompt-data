The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is incremented by 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` has at least `len(arr)` tuples, `j` is 2, and the tuple at index `i` is greater than the tuple at index `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
