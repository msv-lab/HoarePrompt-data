According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to `len(arr)`. For the loop to execute again, the value of `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr` has at least `len(arr)` tuples. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 3 to ensure that `j` is still a valid index.

State: **`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, where `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` has at least `len(arr)` tuples, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than 3**
