`days` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `arr` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is 2, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`days` is 2, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `j` is 2**
