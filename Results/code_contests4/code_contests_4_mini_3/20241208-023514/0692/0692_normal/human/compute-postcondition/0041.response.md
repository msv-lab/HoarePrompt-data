According to the code, the loop iterates over the index `j`, which starts from 1 and goes up to `len(arr) - 1`. The ability for the loop to execute again depends on the value of `j`. Currently, `j` is at the end of the last iteration, so if `j` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to set `j` to 2 (if it was 1 previously) and ensure that `arr` still has at least 3 elements for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, for the loop to execute a second time `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2**
