According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. The loop starts from `j = 1` and goes until `j < len(arr)`. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of `arr` must be at least 2 (so that `len(arr)` is greater than 1). The variable `i` is not directly affected by the loop execution itself. 

Before the loop starts, `days` is 0, which does not impact the execution of the loop. So, to ensure the loop executes for the first time, we need to confirm that `arr` contains at least 2 tuples.

State: **`days` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1**
