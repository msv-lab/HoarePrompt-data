According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the index `j` and the length of the array `arr`. The loop starts from `j = 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at some value less than `len(arr)`. If `j` is at 1, then for the loop to execute again, `j` will become 2. 

State: **`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2 and the length of `arr` must be greater than 2.**
