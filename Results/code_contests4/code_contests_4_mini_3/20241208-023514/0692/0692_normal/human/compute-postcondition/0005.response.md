The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is 1, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, and the tuple at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the tuple at index `j` in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
