The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is not specified, but it is known that it counts how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. Since the operation directly modifies `days`, it will now be `days + 1`. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `j`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`days` is incremented by 1**
