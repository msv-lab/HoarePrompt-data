The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) representing the number of days, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the prices on the i-th day. The number of tuples in `arr` is `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000), and the sum of `n` over all tuples does not exceed 150000. 

After executing the function body, it processes the input data based on the specified conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of tuples containing the number of days and corresponding prices for those days, and returns processed results based on the input data.**
