The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is unknown, but it is indicated that it is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`. Since `days` is being incremented, it indicates that there is at least one tuple in `arr` that is less than the tuple at index `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is incremented by 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` has at least `len(arr)` tuples, `j` is 2, and the tuple at index `i` is greater than the tuple at index `j`.

Output State: **`days` is incremented by 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` has at least `len(arr)` tuples, `j` is 2, and the tuple at index `i` is greater than the tuple at index `j`.**
