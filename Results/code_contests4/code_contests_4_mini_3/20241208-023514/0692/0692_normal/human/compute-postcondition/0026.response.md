According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to the length of `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3, and it must be ensured that `j` is still less than the length of `arr`.

State: **`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `arr` must have a length greater than 3.**
