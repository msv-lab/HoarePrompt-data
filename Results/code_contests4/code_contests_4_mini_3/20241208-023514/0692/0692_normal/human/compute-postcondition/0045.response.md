Output State: **`days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than the tuple at index `i`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` has at least `len(arr)` tuples. If `arr[i]` is greater than any of the subsequent tuples in `arr`, `days` will be incremented accordingly for each tuple found to be less than `arr[i]` before the loop completes.**
