#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) representing the number of days, and a list of n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the prices on the i-th day. The number of tuples in arr is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000), and the sum of n over all tuples does not exceed 150000.
def func_1(arr):
    days = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                days += 1
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is the count of how many tuples in `arr` are less than any of the tuples preceding them, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains an integer and a list of integers. It attempts to count how many tuples have a first element that is less than any of the tuples preceding them, but it does not correctly implement this logic and does not return a value.
