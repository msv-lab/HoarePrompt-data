arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) representing the number of days, and a list of n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the prices on the i-th day. The number of tuples in arr is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000), and the sum of n over all tuples does not exceed 150000.
