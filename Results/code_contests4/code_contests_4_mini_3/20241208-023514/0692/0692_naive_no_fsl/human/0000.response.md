To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to count the number of days with a "bad" price. A price on day \(i\) is considered bad if there exists a day \(j\) (where \(j > i\)) such that the price on day \(j\) is lower than the price on day \(i\).
2. We need to process multiple test cases (sets of input data).
3. The input consists of:
   - An integer \(t\) (number of test cases).
   - For each test case:
     - An integer \(n\) (number of days).
     - A list of integers representing the prices for those days.

### Review of the Provided Program:
- The function `func_1(arr)` is intended to count the bad days.
- However, upon reviewing the nested loops:
  ```python
  for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
      for j in range(1, len(arr)):
          if arr[i] > arr[j]:
              days += 1
              break
  ```
  - The outer loop iterates over each price in the list except the last one.
  - The inner loop always starts from index 1 (the second price) to compare with `arr[i]`.
  - This means it does not properly compare all later days \(j > i\) since it does not start from \(i + 1\).

### Example of Failure:
Let's consider a case where this program will not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  5 1 4 2
  ```
- Expected output:
  - Day 1 (5): bad because day 2 (1) is lower.
  - Day 3 (4): bad because day 4 (2) is lower.
  - Day 2 (1): not bad because there are no lower prices after it.
  - Total bad days = 2 (days 1 and 3).

- The program will not count correctly because it will not properly compare the price on day 1 and day 3 against all subsequent days due to the incorrect starting index for the inner loop.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of bad prices for all potential cases, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**
