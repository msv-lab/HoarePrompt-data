Correctness: **True**

The program correctly sums the scores provided as input according to the problem description. It takes exactly 10 lines of input, each representing a score (an integer between 0 and 100). The loop iterates 10 times, reading each score, converting it to an integer, and adding it to the cumulative total. Finally, it prints the total score.

Given that the input constraints are respected (10 lines of input with valid integer scores), the program will produce the expected output in every case. The logic correctly handles the accumulation of scores, and since no edge cases or exceptions are missed in the provided input format, the program adheres to the problem requirements.
