According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at 1, and it will continue to execute while `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. 

The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than 10. Since `i` is currently 2, the loop can execute a second time, and `k` will be updated again by adding the input integer.

State: **`k` is `k + input integer`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 10**
