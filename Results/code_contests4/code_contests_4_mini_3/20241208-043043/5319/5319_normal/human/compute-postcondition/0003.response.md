According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute until `i` reaches 10. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `k + int(input())`, which means `k` has been updated with the input integer, and `i` should have been incremented by 1 after the last execution of the loop.

Since this is the first execution of the loop, `i` starts at 0 and will increment after each iteration. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` would be 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 10. After the last iteration, `i` is 1, so the loop can execute again as long as `i` is 1 and less than 10.

State: **`k` is `k + input integer`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than 10**
