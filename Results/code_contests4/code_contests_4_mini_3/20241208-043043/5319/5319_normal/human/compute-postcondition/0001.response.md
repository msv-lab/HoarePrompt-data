According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute 10 times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = 9`. The variable `k` being initialized to 0 does not affect the execution of the loop. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be set to its starting value, which is 0. 

State: **`k` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
