Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads exactly 10 lines of input, which is consistent with the problem description that specifies there will be 10 scores provided as input.

2. **Score Constraints**: Each score is read as an integer and is expected to be in the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive). This aligns with the conditions provided in the problem statement.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The function uses a loop that iterates 10 times, accumulating the scores in the variable `k`. After the loop completes, `k` holds the total sum of the scores, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total score, which matches the output requirement stated in the problem description.

Since the program adheres to the specifications for input, processing, and output, it is correct. It will accurately compute the total score for any valid input conforming to the specified constraints.
