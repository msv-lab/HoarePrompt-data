Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by summing the scores of exactly 10 problems, as specified. Here's how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses a loop that runs exactly 10 times to read input values. Each iteration reads an integer representing the score of a problem, which matches the requirement of receiving 10 scores.

2. **Score Constraints**: The program converts the input to integers with `int(input())`, which is valid since the input values are guaranteed to be integers within the range 0 to 100 (inclusive).

3. **Summation Logic**: The variable `k` is initialized to 0 and accumulates the score from each input. After the loop completes, `k` contains the total score, which meets the requirement to output the total score of all problems.

4. **Output**: The final value of `k` is printed, which directly corresponds to the total score as required by the problem description.

In conclusion, the program implements the logic to read 10 scores and calculate their sum correctly, adhering to all aspects of the problem description. Therefore, it can be deemed correct.
