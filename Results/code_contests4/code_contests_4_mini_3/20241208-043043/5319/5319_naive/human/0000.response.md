Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly sums the scores of 10 questions as described in the problem statement. It reads 10 integers from input, each representing the score of a question, and adds them together. The range for the scores is valid (0 ≤ si ≤ 100), and since the program is designed to run exactly 10 iterations, it correctly handles the expected input format. There are no edge cases or scenarios that would cause the program to fail in producing the correct total score for the given inputs.
