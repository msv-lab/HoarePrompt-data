The function does not take any input parameters, but the function will process multiple test cases where each test case contains a sequence of composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) with a total of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) across all test cases, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) where the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
