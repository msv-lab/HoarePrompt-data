You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A positive integer is called composite if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.

Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,…,a_n.

She wants to choose an integer m ≤ 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:

  * for each color from 1 to m there is at least one element of this color; 
  * each element is colored and colored exactly one color; 
  * the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, i.e. \gcd(a_i, a_j)>1 for each pair i, j if these elements are colored the same color. 



Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.

Alice showed already that if all a_i ≤ 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m ≤ 11.

Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the amount of numbers in a sequence a.

The second line of the test case contains n composite integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case print 2 lines. The first line should contain a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 11) — the number of used colors. Consider colors to be numbered from 1 to m. The second line should contain any coloring that satisfies the above conditions. Print n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m), where c_i is the color of the i-th element. If there are multiple solutions then you can print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Remember that each color from 1 to m should be used at least once. Any two elements of the same color should not be coprime (i.e. their GCD should be greater than 1).

Note

In the first test case, \gcd(6,10)=2, \gcd(6,15)=3 and \gcd(10,15)=5. Therefore, it's valid to color all elements the same color. Note that there are other colorings which satisfy Alice's requirement in this test case.

In the second test case there is only one element of each color, so the coloring definitely satisfies Alice's requirement.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of composite integers; a is a list of n composite integers where each integer a_i satisfies 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input value, which represents the number of test cases (t) that is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a positive integer input value representing the number of test cases (t), which must be between 1 and 1000. It does not handle any exceptions or validate the input beyond this range.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of a sequence of composite integers, with the number of integers not exceeding 1000, and each integer being between 4 and 1000. The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10,000.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns a sequence of composite integers based on the input provided, with each integer being between 4 and 1000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user, which is expected to be a sequence of composite integers between 4 and 1000. However, it does not validate that the input consists solely of composite integers or that the integers fall within the specified range, which could lead to incorrect outputs if the input does not meet these conditions.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the positive integers read from input, which are composite integers a_i, where each a_i is in the range 4 to 1000, based on the provided test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts multiple test cases of integers read from input, where each integer is expected to be a composite number in the range from 4 to 1000. It returns a map object containing these integers. However, the function does not validate the input, meaning that if the input includes numbers outside the specified range or non-composite numbers, they will still be included in the returned map object without any filtering.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but the function will process multiple test cases where each test case contains a sequence of composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) with a total of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) across all test cases, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) where the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list of results from processing multiple test cases of composite integers, where each test case consists of integers in the range of 4 to 1000, with a total of up to 10,000 integers across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of results derived from processing multiple test cases of composite integers that range from 4 to 1000. The function handles a total of up to 10,000 integers across all test cases, but the specifics of the processing logic (contained in `func_3`) are not detailed in the provided code. Therefore, the exact nature of the results returned is dependent on the implementation of `func_3`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters directly, but it is expected to read multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of composite integers, followed by a line containing n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_5():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases of composite integers from a specified input file, expecting each test case to start with a positive integer indicating the number of composite integers followed by the composite integers themselves. However, it lacks any processing logic for the integers and does not return any output directly, as it only redirects standard input and output streams. Therefore, the actual functionality is limited to setting up file input/output without performing any computations or returning values.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the last non-empty list of tuples processed, `y` is the result of the last valid `x % y` operation, with `x` and `y` having been swapped in each iteration until no further valid operation can be performed.
    return x
    #The program returns the last non-empty list of tuples processed, denoted as 'x'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` and a list of tuples `y`. It processes `y` through a while loop that swaps `x` and `y` and performs a modulo operation until `y` becomes zero. The function then returns the last non-empty list of tuples processed, which is `x`. Note that the function does not directly process the composite integers in the tuples, and the functionality may not align with typical expectations of handling such inputs based on the annotations.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_7 handles multiple test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), where the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 10^4. The integers a_i are guaranteed to be composite numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` followed by `n` composite integers `a_i`. It processes these integers to identify unique occurrences based on their divisibility by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. The function maintains a count of how many times integers satisfying these conditions appear and generates a list of unique values corresponding to these occurrences. Finally, it calls another function `func_8` with the maximum value from the list `l` and then with all the values in `l`. The function does not return any values but performs operations based on the processed integers.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` contains a variable number of test case inputs, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sep` is ' ', `at_start` is False, and the value written to `file` is either the value of `kwargs['end']` if it exists or '\n' if it does not. If `flush` was True, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `flush` as it has been popped, and the `file.flush()` operation is executed, ensuring that all buffered output to `file` is written out immediately.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable number of arguments and prints them to a specified output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). It separates the printed values with a specified separator (defaulting to a space) and allows for customization of the ending character (defaulting to a newline). If requested, the function can flush the output stream immediately after writing. However, it does not return any values or results based on the inputs, it simply handles the output.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
