The function accepts multiple test cases of integers read from input, where each integer is expected to be a composite number in the range from 4 to 1000. It returns a map object containing these integers. However, the function does not validate the input, meaning that if the input includes numbers outside the specified range or non-composite numbers, they will still be included in the returned map object without any filtering.
