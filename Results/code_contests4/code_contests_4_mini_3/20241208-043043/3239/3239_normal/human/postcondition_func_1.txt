The function does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user, which is expected to be a sequence of composite integers between 4 and 1000. However, it does not validate that the input consists solely of composite integers or that the integers fall within the specified range, which could lead to incorrect outputs if the input does not meet these conditions.
