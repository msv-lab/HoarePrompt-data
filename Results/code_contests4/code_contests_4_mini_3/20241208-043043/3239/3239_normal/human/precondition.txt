t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of composite integers; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) is composite. The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
