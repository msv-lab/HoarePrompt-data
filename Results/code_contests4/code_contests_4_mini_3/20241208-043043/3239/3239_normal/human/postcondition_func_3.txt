The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of results derived from processing multiple test cases of composite integers that range from 4 to 1000. The function handles a total of up to 10,000 integers across all test cases, but the specifics of the processing logic (contained in `func_3`) are not detailed in the provided code. Therefore, the exact nature of the results returned is dependent on the implementation of `func_3`.
