The function func_7 handles multiple test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), where the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 10^4. The integers a_i are guaranteed to be composite numbers.
