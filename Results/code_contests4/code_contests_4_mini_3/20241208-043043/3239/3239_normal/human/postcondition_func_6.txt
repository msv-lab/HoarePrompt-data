The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` followed by `n` composite integers `a_i`. It processes these integers to identify unique occurrences based on their divisibility by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. The function maintains a count of how many times integers satisfying these conditions appear and generates a list of unique values corresponding to these occurrences. Finally, it calls another function `func_8` with the maximum value from the list `l` and then with all the values in `l`. The function does not return any values but performs operations based on the processed integers.
