The function does not take any input parameters directly, but it is expected to read multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of composite integers, followed by a line containing n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
