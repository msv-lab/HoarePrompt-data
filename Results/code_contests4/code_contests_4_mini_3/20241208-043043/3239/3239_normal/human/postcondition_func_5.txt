The function accepts a positive integer `x` and a list of tuples `y`. It processes `y` through a while loop that swaps `x` and `y` and performs a modulo operation until `y` becomes zero. The function then returns the last non-empty list of tuples processed, which is `x`. Note that the function does not directly process the composite integers in the tuples, and the functionality may not align with typical expectations of handling such inputs based on the annotations.
