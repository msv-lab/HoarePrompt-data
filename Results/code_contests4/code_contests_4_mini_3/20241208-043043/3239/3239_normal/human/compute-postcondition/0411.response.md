Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the list `a` is the result of `func_4()`, where `a[i]` is an odd number not divisible by 3, 5, and is not divisible by 7. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f` is a list with the fifth element as 1 and all other elements as 0, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `l` remains [0]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is incremented by 1, `g[5]` is set to 1 if `f[5]` was truthy, otherwise `g[5]` is 0, `j` is updated to 1, and `l` is set to [1]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, and is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is set to 1, `g` remains a list of 12 zeros, and `j` is either 0 or 1 with `l` set to [0]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 and is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is set to 1; if divisible by 19, `f[10]` is set to 1, `j` becomes 1, and `l` is updated to [1]. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[10]` is set to 1, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], and `g` remains a list of 12 zeros. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29 but not by 17, then `f[10]` is set to 1; otherwise, the last element of `f` is set to 1, and `g` will depend on the conditions satisfied, along with adjustments to `j` and `l` based on the conditions met.***
