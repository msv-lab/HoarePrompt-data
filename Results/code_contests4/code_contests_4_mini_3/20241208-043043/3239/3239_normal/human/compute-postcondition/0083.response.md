The code appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been increased by 1 previously, but its exact value is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been incremented and its new value is appended to the list `l`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged and are not influenced by this operation.

Output State: **`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 19, the value of `f[8]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
