The code `l.append(g[5])` appends the value of `g[5]` to the list `l`. The previous value of `g` is a list of 12 zeros, so `g[5]` is `0`. Thus, appending `0` to list `l`, which is initially empty, means `l` will contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is divisible by 11, and the value of `f[5]` is truthy (non-zero).**
