The value of `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`. However, since the exact value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, we can only say that `g[3]` will have the value of the incremented `j`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 2, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.
