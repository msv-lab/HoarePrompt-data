Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11, and the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true, `l` includes `g[6]`. If `f[6]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
