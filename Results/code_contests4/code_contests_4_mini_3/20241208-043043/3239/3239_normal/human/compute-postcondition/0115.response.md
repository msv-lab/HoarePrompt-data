Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29, and the element `a[i]` is divisible by 31. If `f[11]` is true, `l` is appended with `g[11]`. If `f[11]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, and `g[11]` is set to the new value of `j`.***
