Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 or 19 but divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, 19, or 23 but divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, 19, 23, or 29 but divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, there is no change to `f[11]`. Meanwhile, `j`, `l`, and `g[9]` remain unchanged.***
