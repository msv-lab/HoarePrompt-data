The code assigns the value of `j` to the index `2` of the list `g`. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1, but its exact value is not provided. The other variables (`func_1()`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
