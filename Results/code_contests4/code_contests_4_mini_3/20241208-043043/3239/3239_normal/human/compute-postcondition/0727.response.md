The code `l.append(g[5])` appends the value at index 5 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The variables `n`, `i`, and the return value of `func_1()` are not directly affected by this operation. The output state will reflect the operation performed on `l` and the fact that `g[5]` is accessed, but the specific values of `l` and `g` are not known from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and the value at g[5] has been appended to l.**
