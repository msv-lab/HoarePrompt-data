Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is increased by 1; otherwise, there is no change to `f[11]`. Meanwhile, `j`, `l`, and `g[9]` remain unchanged.***
