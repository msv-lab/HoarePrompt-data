The code appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, `l` will now contain the value of `j`, but we cannot specify what `j` is. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`.**
