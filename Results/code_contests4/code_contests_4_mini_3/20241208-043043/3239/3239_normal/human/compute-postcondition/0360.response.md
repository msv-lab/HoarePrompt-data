The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `l` will contain the value 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` contains 1, `a` is the result of `func_4()` with the specified conditions on `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` contains 1, `a` is the result of `func_4()`**.
