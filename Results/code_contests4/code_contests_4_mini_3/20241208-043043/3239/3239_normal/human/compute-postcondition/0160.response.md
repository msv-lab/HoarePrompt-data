The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables (`func_1()`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.**
