The code appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1, but its exact value before the increment is unknown. Since `j` is now increased by 1, the current value of `j` is greater than 1. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 11, the value of `f[5]` is false, `j` is greater than 1, and `l` has the value of `j` appended to it.
