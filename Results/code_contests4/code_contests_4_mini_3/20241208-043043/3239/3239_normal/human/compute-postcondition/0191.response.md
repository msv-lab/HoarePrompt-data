`j` is increased by 1 before the code snippet executes. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, but `j` is now a value greater than its previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is a value greater than 1, and `l` now includes the updated value of `j`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is a value greater than 1, and `l` now includes the updated value of `j`.**
