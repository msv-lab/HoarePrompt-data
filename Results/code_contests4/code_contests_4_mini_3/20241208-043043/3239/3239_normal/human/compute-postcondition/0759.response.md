The value of `j` is increased by 1, and now the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state only specifies that `j` is increased by 1 but does not provide the initial value of `j`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `j`. However, we can state that `j` has been updated, and it is now appended to `l`. The state of `l` is affected by the addition of the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, and the new value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
