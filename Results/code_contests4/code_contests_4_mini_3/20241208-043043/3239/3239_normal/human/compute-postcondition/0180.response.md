The value of `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 and `l` is updated to include this new value of `j`, the output state reflects the updated value of `g[9]`. The previous values of the other variables are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`; `g[9]` is set to the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`; `g[9]` is set to the new value of `j`.**
