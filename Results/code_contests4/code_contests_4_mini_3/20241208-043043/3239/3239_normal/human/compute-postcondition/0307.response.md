The value of `g[2]` is 0, as `g` is a list of 12 zeros. When we execute `l.append(g[2])`, we are appending the value of `g[2]` (which is 0) to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` now contains one element which is 0, and `a` is the result of `func_4()`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` now contains one element which is 0, and `a` is the result of `func_4()`**
