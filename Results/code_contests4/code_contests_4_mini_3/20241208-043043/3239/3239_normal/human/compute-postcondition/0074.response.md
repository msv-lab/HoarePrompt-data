The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state of `g[7]` is unknown, but it is updated to the current value of `j`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, divisible by 17, `f[7]` is false, `l` now includes the new value of `j`, and `g[7]` is now equal to `j`.
