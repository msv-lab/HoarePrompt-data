Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `f[6]` is true, `l` has `g[6]` appended to it, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[6]` is assigned the current value of `j`.***
