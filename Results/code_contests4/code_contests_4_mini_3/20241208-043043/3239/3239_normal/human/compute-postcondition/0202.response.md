Postcondition: ***Given that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1, if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if it was originally true, `g[6]` is appended to `l`, else `j` is assigned the value of `g[6]` and `l` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 but is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1; if it was true, `l` includes `g[7]`, otherwise `j` is increased by 1, `l` includes the updated value of `j`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1 and `l` is updated by appending `g[9]`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. Finally, if `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
