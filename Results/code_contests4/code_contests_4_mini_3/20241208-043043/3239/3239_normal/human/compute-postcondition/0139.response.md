Postcondition: ***If `f[2]` is true, then `g[2]` is appended to the list `l` while maintaining that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `f[2]` is false, then `j` is increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, with the conditions that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1 still holding true.***
