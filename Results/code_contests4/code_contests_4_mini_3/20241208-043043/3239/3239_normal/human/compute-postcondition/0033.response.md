The code appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The state of `j` is not provided in the initial state, but it is stated that `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, the value of `j` is now at least 1 (depending on its previous value). The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd (not divisible by 2), the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.**
