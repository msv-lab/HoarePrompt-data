The variable `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided. The other variables are not affected by this operation. The list `l` will now include the current value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is increased by 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is false, and `j` is appended to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is increased by 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is false, and `j` is appended to `l`.**
