The value of `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is stated to be increased by 1 in the initial state, the exact value of `j` before this assignment is unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `g[5]`, but we know that it will be equal to the incremented value of `j`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has `j` appended to it, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
