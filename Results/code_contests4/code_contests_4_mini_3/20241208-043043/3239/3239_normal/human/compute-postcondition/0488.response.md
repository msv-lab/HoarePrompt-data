Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if `f[6]` is true, `g[6]` is appended to `l`, otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, appended to `l`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, then if it is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, `f[9]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, `f[11]` is increased by 1. Additionally, if `n` remains greater than 1, the loop can execute a second time.***
