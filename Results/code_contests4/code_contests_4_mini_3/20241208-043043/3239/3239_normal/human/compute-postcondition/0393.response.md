Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros with `f[10]` now being 1, `g` is a list of 12 zeros since `f[10]` is now true, `j` is 0 since `f[10]` is now true, `l` is [0] since `f[10]` is now true, `a` is the result of `func_4()` and the conditions on `a[i]` remain valid: it is an odd number, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23, and divisible by 29.**
