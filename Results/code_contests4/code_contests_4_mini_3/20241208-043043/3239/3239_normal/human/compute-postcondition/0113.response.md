The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 beforehand, it is now 1 greater than its previous value. The initial state mentions that `n` is greater than 0 and other conditions about `a[i]`, but these do not directly affect the variable `j` or the list `l`. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is false; `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to `l`.

Output State: **`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is false; `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to `l`.**
