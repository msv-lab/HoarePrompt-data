The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `j` is 1. Since `l` is initially an empty list, after appending `j`, `l` will contain the value 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is now [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, and the element `a[0]` is an even number, and the second element of `f` is 0.
