The statement `g[8] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the index 8 of the list `g`. The previous values of the affected variables are `j` (which has been increased by 1 and appended to `l`, but its exact value is not given), and `g` is affected at index 8.

Since `j` was increased by 1 from a previous value (the exact previous value is not provided, but it is incremented), we can say that the current value of `j` is the incremented value. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is the incremented value, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is false, and `j` is appended to `l`. The value of `g[8]` is now set to the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is the incremented value, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is false, and `j` is appended to `l`, `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
