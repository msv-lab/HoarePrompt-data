Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and `a[i]` is odd. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `f[2]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3 but is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is increased by 1; if divisible by 7, `f[4]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 11, `f[5]` becomes true; if divisible by 13, `f[6]` is increased by 1; if divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by either 17 or 19, `f[9]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1; and if divisible by 31 while being odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 29, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.***
