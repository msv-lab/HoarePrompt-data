The code assigns the value of `j` to the fifth element (index 4) of the list `g`. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `g[4]` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list where `g[4]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and `f[4]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list where `g[4]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and `f[4]` is 0.**
