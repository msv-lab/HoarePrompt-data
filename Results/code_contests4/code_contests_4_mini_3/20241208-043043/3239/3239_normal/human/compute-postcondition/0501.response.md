The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The variable `i` remains 2, and `n` is greater than 1, with the condition for the loop to execute a second time being that `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1**
