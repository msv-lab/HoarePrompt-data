The code assigns the value of `j` (which is 1) to the 10th position (index 9) of the list `g`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list with the 10th element set to 1, `j` is 1, `l` is now a list containing 1, `a` is the result of `func_4()`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list with the 10th element set to 1, `j` is 1, `l` is now a list containing 1, `a` is the result of `func_4()`**
