The code assigns the current value of `j` to the 8th index of the list `g`. The value of `j` has been increased by 1 from its previous state, but the exact value of `j` is not specified. The variable `n` is greater than 2, and the function `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, but these do not directly affect the assignment to `g[8]`. The state of `g[8]` is updated with the value of `j`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
