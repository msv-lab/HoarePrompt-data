The value of `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous value of `g[2]` was 0, so it is updated to 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list where `g[2]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` is now [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, and `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and the element `f[2]` is 0.
