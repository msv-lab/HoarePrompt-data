Postcondition: ***`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, and divisible by 5. If `f[3]` is true, then the value of `g[3]` is appended to list `l`. If `f[3]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
