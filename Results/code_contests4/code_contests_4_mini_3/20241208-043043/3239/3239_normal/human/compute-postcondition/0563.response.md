Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is at least 2. The variables `j`, `l`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged, and if `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute a second time.***
