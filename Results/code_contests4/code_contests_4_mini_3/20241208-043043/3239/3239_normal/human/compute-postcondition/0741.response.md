The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The value of `j` is previously unknown, but it has been increased by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been incremented, and its current value is now being appended to `l`. The states of `n` and `i` are unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1; `j` has been increased by 1 and is appended to the list `l`.**
