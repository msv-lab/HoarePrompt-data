You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be  greater than 3**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time students_list is a list of students with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute a third time students_list is a list of students with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *Given that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1, if `a[i]` is even, then `f[1]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not even, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `g[2]` is appended to the list `l`. If `f[2]` is false, `j` is increased by 1 and appended to `l`, `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[2]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3 but divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is updated to true, leaving `l`, `j`, and `g[3]` unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 but divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented; if divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented; if divisible by 13, `f[6]` is incremented, and if it was originally true, `g[6]` is appended to `l`, otherwise `j` is assigned the value of `g[6]` and `l` remains unchanged. For non-divisibility by 13 but divisibility by 17, `f[7]` is incremented, and if true, `l` includes `g[7]`, otherwise `j` is increased by 1 and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. If not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented; if not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented and `l` is updated by appending `g[9]`. If not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented; and if not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
