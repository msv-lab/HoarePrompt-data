Postcondition: ***If `f[1]` is true, then `l` contains the value of `g[1]` appended to it. If `f[1]` is false, then `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. In both cases, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and the element at index `i` of array `a` is even.***
