The statement `f[1] += 1` increments the value of `f[1]` by 1. The previous value of `f[1]` is not specified, but since `f[1]` is a boolean (true or false), it can potentially represent a value of 1 (true) or remain unchanged if it was initially false (0). Other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `g[1]`, `l`) are not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `f[1]` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `f[1]` is increased by 1**.
