Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `l` contains either [0] if `f[2]` is true or [1] if `f[2]` is false, and `a` is the result of `func_4()` where the element `a[i]` is an odd number and divisible by 3. If `f[2]` is true, `l` contains one element which is 0; otherwise, `g[2]` is now 1, `j` is set to 1, and `l` contains one element which is 1.***
