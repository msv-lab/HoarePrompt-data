The code appends the value of `g[4]` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `g` is a list of 12 zeros, meaning `g[4]` is 0. Since `l` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `l` will contain a single element, which is 0. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and the fifth element of `f` is true (non-zero).**
