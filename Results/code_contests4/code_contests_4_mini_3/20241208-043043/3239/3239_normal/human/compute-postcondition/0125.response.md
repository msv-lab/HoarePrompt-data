Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, and remains odd and not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, additional conditions apply: if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is increased by 1; if divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1; if divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 23, an element from `g[9]` is appended to `l`; if not divisible by 23, then `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[9]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
