The value of `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 based on the initial state, the value of `g[3]` will be equal to this incremented value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 5, the value of `f[3]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains `j` appended to it, and `g[3]` is equal to the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 5, the value of `f[3]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains `j` appended to it, and `g[3]` is equal to the value of `j`.**
