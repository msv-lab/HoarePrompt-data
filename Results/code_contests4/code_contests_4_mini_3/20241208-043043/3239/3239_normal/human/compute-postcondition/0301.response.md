The value of `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is now a list where `g[1]` is 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[0]` is an even number, and the second element of `f` is 0.
