The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified. Therefore, the state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `j` has been appended to `l`, but we do not know its specific value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` has been appended to `l`**
