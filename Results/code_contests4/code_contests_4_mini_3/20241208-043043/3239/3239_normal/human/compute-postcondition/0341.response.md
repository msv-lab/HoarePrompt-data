The value of `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous values of `g` are a list of 12 zeros, so after execution, `g[5]` will be updated to 1, while all other elements remain the same. The values of `n`, `i`, `f`, `j`, `l`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 elements where `g[5]` is 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`**
