The code `l.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `l`. The previous value of `l` is an empty list, so after execution, `l` will contain one element, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and `a[i]` is divisible by 11.**
