The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, which means that `j` has a specific value greater than its previous state. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `j`, but it indicates that `j` has already been incremented. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been appended to the list `l`, while `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
