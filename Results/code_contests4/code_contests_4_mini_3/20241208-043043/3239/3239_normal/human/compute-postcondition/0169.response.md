Postcondition: ***If `f[7]` is true, then `l` is updated to include `g[7]`. If `f[7]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the updated value of `j`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. In both cases, `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1.***
