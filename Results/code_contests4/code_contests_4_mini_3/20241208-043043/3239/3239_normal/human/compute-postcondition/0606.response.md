The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 5, the value of `f[3]` is false, and `j` is increased by 1.
