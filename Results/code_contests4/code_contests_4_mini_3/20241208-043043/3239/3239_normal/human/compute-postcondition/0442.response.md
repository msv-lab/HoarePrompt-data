The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 in the initial state, its current value is now 1 more than its previous value. The variable `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, but they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of `j` and the action taken on `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
