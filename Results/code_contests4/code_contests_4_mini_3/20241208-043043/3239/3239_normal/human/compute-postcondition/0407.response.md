Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `a` is the result of `func_4()` with `a[i]` being an odd number that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29; if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f` is a list of 12 elements with the 10th element being 1, `g` is a list of 12 elements, `j` is 1, and `l` is updated to [1] due to `f[8]` becoming 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f` is a list of 12 elements with the 10th element being 1, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, and `l` contains [0]. Otherwise, `f` is a list of 12 elements where `f[10]` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 29; otherwise, the last element of `f` is set to 1. `g` can be a list of 12 zeros or a list of 11 zeros and 1 depending on the condition, and `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the value of `f[10]`, while `l` is either [0] or [1] accordingly.***
