The value of `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. This means that the fourth element of the list `g` (considering 0-based indexing) is updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 elements where the fourth element is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the fourth element of `f` is 0.
