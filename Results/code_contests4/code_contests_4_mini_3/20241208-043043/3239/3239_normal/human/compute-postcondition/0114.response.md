The variable `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `g[11]` is now equal to the incremented value of `j`.

Output State: **`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is false; `j` is incremented by 1, and `g[11]` is equal to the incremented value of `j`.**
