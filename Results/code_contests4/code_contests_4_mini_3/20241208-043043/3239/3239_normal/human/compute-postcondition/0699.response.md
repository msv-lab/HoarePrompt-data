Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, and the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1 while all other conditions remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and `f[5]` is true, with other conditions unchanged. If `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11 but is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is odd and meets divisibility conditions, `f[7]` is incremented by 1 if divisible by 17, `f[8]` is incremented by 1 if divisible by 19, or `f[9]` is incremented by 1 if not divisible by either 17 or 19. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 29, and divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. All other variables `j`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged.***
