The value of `f[4]` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `f[4]` is unknown, so it does not directly impact other variables. The states of the other variables are not affected since the condition involving `f[4]` has not been executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `f[4]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `f[4]` is incremented by 1**.
