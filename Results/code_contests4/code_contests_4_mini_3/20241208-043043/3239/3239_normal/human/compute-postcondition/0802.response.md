The code assigns the value of `j` to the 4th index of the list `g`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `j` has been incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`. Since the exact value of `j` is unknown, we can only say that `g[4]` now holds the value of `j`. The states of `n`, `i`, and `l` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
