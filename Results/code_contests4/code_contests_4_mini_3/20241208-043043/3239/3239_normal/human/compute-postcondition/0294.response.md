According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`f`, `g`, `j`, `l`, and `a`) do not affect the ability of the loop to run but may be relevant to the loop's body. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is the result of `func_1()`, and we need to ensure that this value is greater than 0. The variable `i` should begin at 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `a` is the result of `func_4()`**
