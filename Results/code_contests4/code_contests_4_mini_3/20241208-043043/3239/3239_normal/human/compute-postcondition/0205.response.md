Postcondition: ***Given that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1, if `a[i]` is even, then `f[1]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not even, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `g[2]` is appended to the list `l`. If `f[2]` is false, `j` is increased by 1 and appended to `l`, `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[2]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3 but divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is updated to true, leaving `l`, `j`, and `g[3]` unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 but divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented; if divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented; if divisible by 13, `f[6]` is incremented, and if it was originally true, `g[6]` is appended to `l`, otherwise `j` is assigned the value of `g[6]` and `l` remains unchanged. For non-divisibility by 13 but divisibility by 17, `f[7]` is incremented, and if true, `l` includes `g[7]`, otherwise `j` is increased by 1 and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. If not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented; if not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented and `l` is updated by appending `g[9]`. If not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented; and if not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented.***
