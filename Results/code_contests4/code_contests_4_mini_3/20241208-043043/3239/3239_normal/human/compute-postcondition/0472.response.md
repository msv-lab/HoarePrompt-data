The variable `l` is not defined in the initial state, but the code attempts to append the value of `j` to it. Since `j` is increased by 1, it has a specific value greater than its previous state. However, without knowing the exact value of `j` or whether `l` was initialized as a list, we can't definitively assess the outcome of the execution. 

Therefore, the output state indicates that we are attempting to append `j` to `l`, but the state of `l` is not defined, leaving us with the following conclusion:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and we attempt to append `j` to an undefined list `l`.**
