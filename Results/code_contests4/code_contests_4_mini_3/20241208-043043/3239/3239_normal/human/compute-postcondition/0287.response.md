According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. Since `n` is greater than 0, it indicates that `func_1()` must return a positive value for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and the loop has executed for the current range determined by `func_1()`. 

To execute one more time, we need to consider that the loop will iterate for the next value returned by `func_1()`, which must still be greater than the current number of iterations executed. The state after the iteration will need to reflect that a new iteration is starting.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, the value of `n` must still be greater than the number of iterations already completed, which we will denote as `n'`. Since the loop has executed at least once, `n'` will be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_1()` returns a value that allows for at least one more iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1; `f` reflects the count of how many times each divisibility condition was triggered; `g` contains the last assigned values of `j` for each corresponding index; `j` is the count of unique occurrences for conditions that were not previously met; `l` contains the values based on the conditions evaluated during the loop; `func_8(*l)` is called with the maximum value from `l`.**
