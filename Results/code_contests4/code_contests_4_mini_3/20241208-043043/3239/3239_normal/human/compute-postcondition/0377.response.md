The code appends the value of `g[9]` to the list `l`. Since `g` is initialized as a list of 12 zeros, `g[9]` is 0. Therefore, appending `g[9]` (which is 0) to `l` results in `l` containing a single element, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is divisible by 23, and `f[9]` is a truthy value (not zero).**
