Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is increased by 1, while the values of `g[4]`, `j`, and the list `l` remain undetermined based on this increment. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and if it is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 but divisible by 13, `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if `f[6]` is true, `g[6]` is appended to `l`, otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, appended to `l`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, it will further check divisibility by 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31, incrementing `f[7]`, `f[8]`, `f[9]`, `f[10]`, and `f[11]` respectively, if applicable. Additionally, if `n` remains greater than 1, the loop can execute a second time.***
