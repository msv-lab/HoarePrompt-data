The value of `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. This updates the 12th element of the list `g` from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 11 zeros and 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()` with the specified conditions.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 11 zeros and 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()` with the specified conditions.**
