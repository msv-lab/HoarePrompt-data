The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been previously increased by 1, but its exact value is unknown. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the list `l` and acknowledges that `j` has been appended.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
