The code snippet `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but the exact value of `j` is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that the list `l` now contains the value of `j`, whatever that may be, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to list `l`.**
