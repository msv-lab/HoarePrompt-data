The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` was previously increased by 1, but its exact value isn't specified in the initial state. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after execution, the output state will reflect that `j` has been appended to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is increased by 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is false, and `j` is appended to `l`.**
