Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is increased by 1, and if it was originally true, `l` includes `g[7]`; if it was false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` includes the updated value of `j`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1, and `l` is updated by appending `g[9]`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
