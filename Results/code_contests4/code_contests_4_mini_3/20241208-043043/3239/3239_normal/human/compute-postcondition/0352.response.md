Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `l` is either [0] or [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, and the element `a[i]` is an odd number that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11, but is divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true (or non-zero), then `l` is updated to [0]. Otherwise, `g[6]` is updated to 1, `j` is set to 1, and `l` is updated to [1].***
