Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list with the 10th element set to 1 if `f[9]` is falsy, otherwise, `g` remains a list of 12 zeros. `j` is set to 1 if `f[9]` is falsy, otherwise `j` is 0. The list `l` contains either 1 if `f[9]` is falsy, or it contains [0] if `f[9]` is truthy. The element `a[i]` remains an odd number that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, but is divisible by 23.***
