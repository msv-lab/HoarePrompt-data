According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
