The value of `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous value of `g[10]` was 0 (from the list of zeros), so it gets updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 values where `g[10]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, and the conditions on `a[i]` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 values where `g[10]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, and the conditions on `a[i]` are still valid.**
