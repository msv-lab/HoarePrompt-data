The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it processes a variable number of test case inputs that consist of integers. Each test case includes an integer `n`, which indicates the number of composite integers that follow, denoted as a list of `n` composite integers `a_i`. Each composite integer satisfies the constraints of being between 4 and 1000, and the total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10,000. 

The function outputs results based on these test cases, but the specific return values are not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts a variable number of test case inputs consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` composite integers, and processes them according to the defined logic, returning results based on the given test cases.**
