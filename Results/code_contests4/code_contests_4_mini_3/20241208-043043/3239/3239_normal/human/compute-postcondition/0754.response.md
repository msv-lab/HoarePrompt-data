The code assigns the value of `j` to the 9th index of the list `g`. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, but since we do not have the specific value of `j`, we cannot determine the value being assigned to `g[9]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
