The code `l.append(g[3])` appends the value of `g[3]` to the list `l`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the return value of `func_1()` are not directly affected by this operation. However, the state of `l` will change with the addition of `g[3]`. Since the specific values of `g` and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `l` after the operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change made to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and `g[3]` is appended to the list `l`.**
