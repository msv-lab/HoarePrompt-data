Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 elements, where if `f[8]` is true (non-zero), then `l` is updated to [0], and `j` remains 0; otherwise, `g[8]` is updated to 1, `j` becomes 1, and `l` is updated to [1]. The element `a[i]` is an odd number, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, and is divisible by 19.***
