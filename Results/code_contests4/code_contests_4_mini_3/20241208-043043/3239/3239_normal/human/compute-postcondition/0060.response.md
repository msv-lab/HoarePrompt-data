The code `l.append(g[6])` appends the value of `g[6]` to the list `l`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `g[6]`, we cannot determine its specific value. However, the list `l` will now contain one more element, which is the value of `g[6]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 13, the value of `f[6]` is true, and `g[6]` is appended to `l`.**
