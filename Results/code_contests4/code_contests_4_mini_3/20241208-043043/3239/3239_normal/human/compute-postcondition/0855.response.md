Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then the list `l` includes the value of `g[3]`, and `j` is unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `f[4]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, otherwise `f[5]` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, or `f[6]` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 13, or `f[7]` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 17, or `f[8]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, or `f[9]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 23, or `f[10]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, or `f[11]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 31; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged, while `j`, `l`, and `g[9]` remain unchanged.***
