The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state mentions that `j` is increased by 1, but we do not know the previous value of `j`. However, we can conclude that the operation appends the new value of `j` (which is now incremented by 1) to the list `l`. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to list `l`.**
