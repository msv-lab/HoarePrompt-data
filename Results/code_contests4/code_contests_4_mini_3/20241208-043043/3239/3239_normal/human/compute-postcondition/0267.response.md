The code attempts to append the value of `g[11]` to the list `l`. However, there is no information provided about the variable `g` or the list `l`. The values of `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this statement, and the function `func_1()` does not influence the execution of this line. Therefore, without the context of `g` and `l`, it cannot be determined if the operation will succeed or what the state of `l` will be after this operation.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the operation to append `g[11]` to `l` is attempted.**
