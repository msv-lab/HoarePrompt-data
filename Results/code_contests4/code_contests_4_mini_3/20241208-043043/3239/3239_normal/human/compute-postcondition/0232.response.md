The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `j` has been increased. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1**
