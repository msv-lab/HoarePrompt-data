According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` variable. If `args` contains at least one test case input, the loop will execute. At the beginning, `at_start` is True, and `x` will take the values from `args` during each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `args` must contain at least one element, and `x` will be the first element in `args`.

State: **`args` contains at least 1 test case input, `x` is the first element in `args`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True**
