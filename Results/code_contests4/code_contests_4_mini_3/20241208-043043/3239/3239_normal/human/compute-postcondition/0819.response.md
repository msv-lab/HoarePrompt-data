The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is stated that `j` has been increased by 1. The value of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been appended to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has `j` appended to it**.
