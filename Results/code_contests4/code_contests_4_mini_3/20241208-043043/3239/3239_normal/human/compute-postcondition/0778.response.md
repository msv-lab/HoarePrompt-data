Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `f[2]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is increased by 1; if not, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is increased by 1; if not, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is increased by 1; if not, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `f[6]` is increased by 1; if not, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is increased by 1; if not, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is increased by 1; if not, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is increased by 1; if not, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1, with `j`, `l`, and `g[10]` remaining unchanged; if not, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is increased by 1, while the values of `j`, `l`, and `g[10]` remain unchanged.***
