The variable `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been previously increased by 1, its current value is now relevant for the assignment. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j` appended to it; `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j` appended to it; `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
