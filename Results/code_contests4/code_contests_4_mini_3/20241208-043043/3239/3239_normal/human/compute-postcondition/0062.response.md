The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The other variables and conditions in the initial state are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd (not divisible by 2), the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `f[6]` is false, and `j` is increased by 1.
