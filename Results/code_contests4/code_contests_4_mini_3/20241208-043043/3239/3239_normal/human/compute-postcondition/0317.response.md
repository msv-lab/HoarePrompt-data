The code `l.append(g[3])` appends the value of `g[3]` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `g` is a list of 12 zeros, meaning that `g[3]` is 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, after executing the code, the list `l` will contain a single element, which is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` contains [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the value of `f[3]` is true (non-zero).**
