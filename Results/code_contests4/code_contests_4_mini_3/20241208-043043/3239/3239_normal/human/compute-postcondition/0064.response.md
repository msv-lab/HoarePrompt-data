The value of `j` is assigned to `g[6]`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to `l`, we can conclude that `j` is now greater than its previous value (let's call it `j_prev`). The specific value of `j` is not provided, but we know it is greater than 0, thus `g[6]` will be assigned this updated value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `f[6]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to `l`, and `g[6]` is assigned the updated value of `j`.**
