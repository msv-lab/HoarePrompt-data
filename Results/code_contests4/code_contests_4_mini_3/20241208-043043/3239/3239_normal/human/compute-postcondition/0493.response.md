According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, which implies that the loop could execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
