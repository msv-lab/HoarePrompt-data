The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, `a[i]` is divisible by 29, and `f[10]` is 0 (or false).
