The code initializes `l` as an empty list. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`; `f` is a list of integers; `g` is a list of integers; `j` is the total count of new entries; `l` is an empty list; a value has been returned from `func_8(max(l))`; and for the loop to execute again `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`; `f` is a list of integers; `g` is a list of integers; `j` is the total count of new entries; `l` is an empty list; a value has been returned from `func_8(max(l))`; and for the loop to execute again `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`**.
