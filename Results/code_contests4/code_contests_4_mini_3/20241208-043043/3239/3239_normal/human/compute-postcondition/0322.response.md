Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 elements, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `l` contains either [0] or [1]. If the value of `f[3]` is true, then `l` contains [0]. Otherwise, the fourth element of `g` is now 1, `j` is set to 1, and `l` contains [1]. The element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, and `a[i]` is divisible by 5.***
