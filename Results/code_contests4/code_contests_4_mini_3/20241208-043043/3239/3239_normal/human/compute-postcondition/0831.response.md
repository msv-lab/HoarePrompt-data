The variable `j` is increased by 1 and then appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is already increased, its new value is now being added to `l`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is the incremented value (previous value + 1), and `l` now contains the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is the incremented value, and `l` contains the new value of `j**.
