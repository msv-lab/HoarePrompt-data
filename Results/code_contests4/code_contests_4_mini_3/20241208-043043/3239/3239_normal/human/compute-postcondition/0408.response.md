Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `a` is the result of `func_4()` with `a[i]` being an odd number that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is set to 1, and all conditions on `a[i]` remain true. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, and further conditions apply: if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f` has the 10th element set to 1, `j` is 1, `l` is updated to [1], and `g` can contain either 12 elements with one depending on the condition. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f` has the 10th element set to 1, `j` is 0, `l` contains [0], and `g` is a list of 12 zeros. Otherwise, `f` has the 10th element set to 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, otherwise, the last element of `f` is set to 1, with `g` potentially being a list of 12 zeros or a list of 11 zeros and 1, and `j` and `l` will change accordingly based on the conditions met.***
