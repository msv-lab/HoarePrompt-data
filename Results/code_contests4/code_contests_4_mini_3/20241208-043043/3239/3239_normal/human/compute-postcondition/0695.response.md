Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`. If `a[i]` is odd and satisfies all divisibility conditions, if `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is odd and satisfies all divisibility conditions, `f[8]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 19; otherwise, `f[9]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29, and divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. All other variables `j`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged.***
