The statement `l.append(g[9])` appends the value at index 9 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The initial state mentions that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, but these variables do not directly affect the operation of appending a value to `l`. 

Assuming that `g` is a list with at least 10 elements, the value at index 9 will be appended to `l`. Since we have no specific values for `g` and `l`, we cannot determine the exact values after the operation, but we know that the length of `l` will increase by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and the value at index 9 of `g` is appended to `l`.**
