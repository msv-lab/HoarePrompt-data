The `append` method is called on the list `l`, which is initially empty. The value of `j` is 1, so after executing `l.append(j)`, the list `l` will contain the single element `[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is now `[1]`, `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, and `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and the element `f[2]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is now [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, and `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and the element `f[2]` is 0.**
