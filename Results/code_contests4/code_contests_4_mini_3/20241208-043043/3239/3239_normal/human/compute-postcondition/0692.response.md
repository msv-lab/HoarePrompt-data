Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `l`, and `g[10]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1, while `l`, `j`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged.***
