The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified. The other variables (`func_1()` returning a value greater than 0, `n` being greater than 1, and `i` being 1) do not directly impact this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been appended to the list `l`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
