Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by the primes up to 29. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then the list `l` has a new element appended from `g[9]`, otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, with `f[9]` being incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1; if `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
