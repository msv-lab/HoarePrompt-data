The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `g[7]` will now be 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 elements where `g[7]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` contains 1, `a` is the result of `func_4()`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 elements where `g[7]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` contains 1, `a` is the result of `func_4()`**
