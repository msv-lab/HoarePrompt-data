Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 2, not divisible by 3, divisible by 7. If `f[4]` is true, then `l` now contains `g[4]`. If `f[4]` is false, then `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
