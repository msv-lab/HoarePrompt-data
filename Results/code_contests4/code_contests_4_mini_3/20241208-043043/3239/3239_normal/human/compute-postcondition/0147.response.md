The statement `l.append(g[4])` appends the value at index 4 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The current values of `func_1()`, `n`, and `i` do not affect this operation directly. We don't have the previous states of `l` or `g`, but since `g[4]` must be a valid index, we can assume `g` has at least 5 elements. The output state will reflect that the list `l` has been updated with the value from `g[4]`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `l` is updated with the value from `g[4]**.
