Functionality: ** The function accepts a variable number of arguments and prints them to a specified output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). It separates the printed values with a specified separator (defaulting to a space) and allows for customization of the ending character (defaulting to a newline). If requested, the function can flush the output stream immediately after writing. However, it does not return any values or results based on the inputs, it simply handles the output. **
