Postcondition: ***Given that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2, if `a[i] % 7 == 0`, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1; if `f[4]` was previously true, `l` is updated to include `g[4]`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the value of `j`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 7 != 0`, then if `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `f[5]` is increased by 1. If `a[i] % 11 != 0` and `a[i] % 13 == 0`, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 11 != 0`, `a[i] % 13 != 0`, and `a[i] % 17 == 0`, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1; if `f[7]` was previously false, `j` is increased by 1, appended to `l`, and assigned to `g[7]`. If `a[i] % 17 != 0`, then if `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `f[8]` is increased by 1; if `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `f[9]` is incremented by 1; if `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `f[10]` is incremented by 1, and `l` includes `g[10]`. If none of these conditions hold but `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `f[11]` is increased by 1, while `g[11]`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
