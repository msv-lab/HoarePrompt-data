The variable `g` at index `9` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 and `l` contains the value of `j`, but the exact values of `j` and `l` are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `g[9]`, which is equal to the current value of `j`. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`; `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
