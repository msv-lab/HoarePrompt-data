Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1, and the conditions regarding `l`, `j`, `g[4]`, `func_1()`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and `f[5]` is true, while the conditions for modifying `l`, `j`, and `g[5]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11 but is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is odd and satisfies the divisibility conditions, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1 if divisible by 17, `f[8]` is incremented by 1 if divisible by 19, or `f[9]` is incremented by 1 if not divisible by either 17 or 19. Additionally, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 29, and divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. All other variables `j`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged.***
