The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since `j` has already been increased by 1 in the initial state, we will append this new value of `j` to the list `l`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 7, the value of `f[4]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
