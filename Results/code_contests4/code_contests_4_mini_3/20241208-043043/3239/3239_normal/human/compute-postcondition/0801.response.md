`l` is a list and `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is now one greater than its previous value. The value of `l` is appended with the new value of `j`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected, so the output state reflects the change in `j` and the addition to the list `l`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
