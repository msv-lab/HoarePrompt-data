The code `f[8] += 1` increments the value of `f[8]` by 1. However, we do not have the initial value of `f[8]`, so we cannot definitively determine whether it was true or false before this operation. This means we cannot ascertain the effects on `j`, `l`, or `g[8]` based on the provided information.

However, we can note that the increment of `f[8]` may change its truthiness; if it was initially false (0), it may become true (1) after the increment, but we cannot confirm that without its initial value. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `f[8]` was incremented, but we cannot confirm the specifics about `j`, `l`, or `g[8]`.

Output State: **`f[8]` is incremented by 1; its previous state is unknown**.
