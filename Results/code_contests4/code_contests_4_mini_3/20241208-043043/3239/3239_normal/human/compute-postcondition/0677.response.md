The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is known to have been increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided. The value of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` has been increased by 1, and `l` now contains the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` has been increased by 1, and `l` now contains the current value of `j`.**
