The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is unknown, so we cannot determine exactly what value is appended to `l`. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` has been increased by 1; the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` has been increased by 1; the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
