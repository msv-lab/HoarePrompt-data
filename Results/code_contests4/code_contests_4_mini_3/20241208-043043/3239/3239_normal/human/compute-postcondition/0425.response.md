The value of `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to `l`, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we know that `j` is greater than or equal to 1 (since it's increased by 1), but we cannot determine its exact value. The value of `g[2]` will be the current value of `j`. 

The states of `n`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `l` has `j` appended to it, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `l` has `j` appended to it, `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`**
