The value of `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. The state of `j` is increased by 1 before this assignment, and `j` has been appended to `l`, but the values of `j` and `l` are not specified in the initial state. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and is divisible by 31; `f[11]` is false; `j` is increased by 1 and appended to `l`; `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and is divisible by 31; `f[11]` is false; `j` is increased by 1 and appended to `l`; `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
