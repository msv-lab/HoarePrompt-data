The value of `j` is increased by 1 prior to the execution of the code, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, `g[6]` is assigned the current (increased) value of `j`. The state of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `l` remains unchanged. Thus, the Output State reflects the assignment to `g[6]` while indicating that the specific value of `j` at this moment is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1; `l` has the value of `j` appended to it; `g[6]` is assigned the current value of `j`.**
