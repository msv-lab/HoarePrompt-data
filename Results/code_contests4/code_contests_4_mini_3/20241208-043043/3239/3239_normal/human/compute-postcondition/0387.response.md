The code `l.append(g[10])` is executed. The variable `g` is a list of 12 zeros, meaning that `g[10]` is 0. The method `append` adds this value to the list `l`. Since `l` is initially an empty list, after execution, `l` will contain a single element which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, `a[i]` is divisible by 29, and `f[10]` is true (non-zero).**
