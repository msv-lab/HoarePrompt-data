The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and since `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, it allows for the loop to potentially execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
