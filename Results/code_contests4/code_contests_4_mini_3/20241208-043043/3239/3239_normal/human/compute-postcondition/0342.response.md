Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 elements where if `f[5]` is truthy, `l` is [0]; otherwise, `g[5]` is 1, `j` is 1, and `l` is [1]. The list `a` is the result of `func_4()`, where the element `a[i]` is an odd number, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, and divisible by 11.***
