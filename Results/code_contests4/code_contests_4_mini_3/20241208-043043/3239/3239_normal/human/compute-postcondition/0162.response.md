The code assigns the value of `j` to the index 6 of the list or array `g`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `j` has been appended to the list `l`, but its specific value isn't provided. The other variables, including the return value of `func_1()`, `n`, and `i`, are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is assigned to `g[6]`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is assigned to `g[6]**
