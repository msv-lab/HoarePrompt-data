The code `g[4] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the index 4 of the list `g`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`. However, the specific value of `j` is not given, but it is implied that it is greater than or equal to 1 since it was increased from 0. Therefore, we can conclude that `g[4]` will take on the value of `j`, which is at least 1.

The output state will reflect the assignment to `g[4]` and confirm the previous values of the other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 7, the value of `f[4]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
