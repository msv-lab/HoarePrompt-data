The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but the exact value of `j` is not specified. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and the return value of `func_1()`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the list `l` due to appending the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.**
