Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, and the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 17. If `f[7]` is true, then `g[7]` has been appended to `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
