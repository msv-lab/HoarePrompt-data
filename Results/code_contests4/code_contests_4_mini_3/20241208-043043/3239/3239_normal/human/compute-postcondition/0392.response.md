Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 values where `g[10]` is 1 if `f[10]` is false, otherwise `g` remains a list of 12 zeros. `j` is 1 if `f[10]` is false, otherwise `j` is 0. `l` is [1] if `f[10]` is false, otherwise `l` is [0]. `a` is the result of `func_4()` and the conditions on `a[i]` remain valid: it is an odd number, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23, and divisible by 29.***
