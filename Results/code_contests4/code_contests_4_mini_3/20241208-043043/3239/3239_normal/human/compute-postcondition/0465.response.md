The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but since the loop is executing at least once, we can infer that `j` is now at least 1. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1**
