The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. This is the only variable that is affected by the code snippet, while the other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 0, `l` is an empty list, a value has been returned from `func_8(max(l))`, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`. 

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 0, `l` is an empty list, a value has been returned from `func_8(max(l))`, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`**.
