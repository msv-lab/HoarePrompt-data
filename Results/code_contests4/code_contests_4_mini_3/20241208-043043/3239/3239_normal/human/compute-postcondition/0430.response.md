The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is not specified, but it is clear that `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this operation. The variable `l` is expected to be a list that will now include this new value of `j`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `l` and the increment of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the new value of `j`.**
