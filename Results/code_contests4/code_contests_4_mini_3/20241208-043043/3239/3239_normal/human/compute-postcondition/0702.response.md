According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute for the first time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. After the iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` should be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`.**
