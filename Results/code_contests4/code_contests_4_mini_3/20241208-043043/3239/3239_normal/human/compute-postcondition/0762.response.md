The value of `f[10]` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `f[10]` is unknown. This operation does not affect the other variables directly, but it could influence the condition checked afterward. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `f[10]` is increased by 1, and the values of `j`, `l`, and `g[10]` remain unchanged until the next part of the logic is executed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `f[10]` is increased by 1, and the values of `j`, `l`, and `g[10]` remain unchanged.**
