The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but since it is being updated, we know it will increase by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
