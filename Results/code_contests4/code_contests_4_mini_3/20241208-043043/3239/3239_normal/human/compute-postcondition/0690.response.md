The statement `f[11] += 1` increments the value of `f[11]` by 1. The previous value of `f[11]` is not specified, but it is important to note that it will now be greater than its previous value. The other variables (`l`, `j`, and `g[11]`) remain unaffected by this operation directly.

Since the output state concerns the values after this operation, we note that `f[11]` has been incremented. Variables `l`, `j`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged in this specific operation.

Output State: **`f[11]` is incremented by 1; `l`, `j`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged.**
