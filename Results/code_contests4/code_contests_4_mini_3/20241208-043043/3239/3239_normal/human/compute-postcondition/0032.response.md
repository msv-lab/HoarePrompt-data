The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd (not divisible by 2), the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and `f[3]` is false; `j` is increased by 1.
