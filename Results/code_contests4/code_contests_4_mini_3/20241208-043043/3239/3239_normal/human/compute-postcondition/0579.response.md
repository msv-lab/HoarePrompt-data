The code initializes the list `g` with 12 zeros. It does not affect `n`, `f`, `j`, `l`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is the total count of new entries, `l` is an empty list, a value has been returned from `func_8(max(l))`, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is the total count of new entries, `l` is an empty list, a value has been returned from `func_8(max(l))`, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`.**
