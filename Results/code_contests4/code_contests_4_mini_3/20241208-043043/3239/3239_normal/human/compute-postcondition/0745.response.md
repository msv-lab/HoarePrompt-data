The code `l.append(g[8])` appends the value from the list or array `g` at index 8 to the list `l`. The variables `n`, `i`, and the return value of `func_1()` are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the addition of the element from `g[8]` to `l`, while the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `g[8]` is appended to `l`.**
