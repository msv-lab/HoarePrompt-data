The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `i`, and the return value of `func_1()` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`.**
