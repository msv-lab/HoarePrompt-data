The value of `f[5]` is incremented by 1. The variables `n`, `i`, `l`, `a[i]`, `j`, and `g[5]` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `f[5]` is now true (incremented), and the conditions for modifying `l`, `j`, and `g[5]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `f[5]` is now true, and the conditions for modifying `l`, `j`, and `g[5]` remain unchanged.**
