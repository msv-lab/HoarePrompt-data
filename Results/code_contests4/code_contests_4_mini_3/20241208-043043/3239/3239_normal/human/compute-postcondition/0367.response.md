The code appends the value of `g[8]` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `g` is a list of 12 zeros, so `g[8]` is 0. The value of `l` is initially an empty list. After the execution of the code, `l` will contain one element which is `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is divisible by 19, and the value of `f[8]` is true (non-zero).**
