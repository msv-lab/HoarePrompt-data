Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 elements. If `f[7]` is true, then `l` contains one element which is 0, and all conditions on `a[i]` remain true. Otherwise, `g[7]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `l` contains 1, and all conditions on `a[i]` remain true.***
