According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

The state of other variables (like `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `l`) will depend on the current value of `a[i]`, but since we don't have specific information about what `a[i]` will be for the next iteration, we can only focus on the necessary adjustments related to `i` and `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
