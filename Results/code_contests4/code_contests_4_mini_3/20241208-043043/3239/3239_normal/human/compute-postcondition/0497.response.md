The value of `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, but since the previous value of `j` is not specified, we can't determine its exact value. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now has an additional element which is the current value of `j`, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now has an additional element which is the current value of `j`, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
