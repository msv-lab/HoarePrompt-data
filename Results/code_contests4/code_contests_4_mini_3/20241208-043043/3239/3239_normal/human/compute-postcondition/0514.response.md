`l` is a list that is being appended with the value of `j`. The value of `j` has been increased by 1, but its previous value is unknown. Therefore, `j` is now one greater than its initial value. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; `l` is appended with the value of `j`, which is increased by 1.**
