Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros or a list of 11 zeros and 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `l` is either [0] or [1], and `a` is the result of `func_4()` such that the element `a[i]` is an odd number, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and divisible by 31. If `f[11]` is true, `l` is updated to [0] and `j` remains 0; otherwise, `l` is updated to [1] and `j` is set to 1.***
