`l` is a list where `j` is appended. The value of `j` is increased by 1 prior to this operation, but the exact value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, after execution, `j` holds its incremented value, and it is added to the list `l`. The states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`**.
