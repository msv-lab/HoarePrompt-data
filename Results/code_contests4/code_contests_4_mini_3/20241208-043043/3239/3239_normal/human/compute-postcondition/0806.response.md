The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `j` and the current values of `n` and `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1**
