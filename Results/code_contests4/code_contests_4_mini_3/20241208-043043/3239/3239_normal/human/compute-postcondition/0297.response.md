The code `l.append(g[1])` appends the value of `g[1]` to the list `l`. Since `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `g[1]` is 0. The initial state indicates that `l` is an empty list. After executing the code, `l` will now contain one element, which is 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is now [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[0]` is an even number, and the second element of `f` (f[1]) is true (non-zero).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is now [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[0]` is an even number, and the second element of `f` (f[1]) is true (non-zero)**.
