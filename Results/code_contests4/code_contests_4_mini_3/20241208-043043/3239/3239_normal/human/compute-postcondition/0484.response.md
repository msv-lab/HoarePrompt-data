Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1, although there is an error due to `g` being undefined. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 and is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute a second time.***
