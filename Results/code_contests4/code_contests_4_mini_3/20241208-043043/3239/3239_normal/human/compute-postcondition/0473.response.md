The variable `g` is an undefined list, and the code attempts to assign the value of `j` to the 10th index of `g`. However, since `g` is not defined, this will raise an error instead of modifying any variables. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as no operations directly affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the defined variables and notes the issue with `g`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and an error occurs due to `g` being undefined.**
