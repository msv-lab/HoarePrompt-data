The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is not specified, so it is unknown. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, and `f[10]` is false; `j` is increased by 1.
