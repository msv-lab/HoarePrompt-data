The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since `j` is already stated to be increased by 1, we assume `j` is now 1 greater than its previous value. The value of `n` and `i` do not affect the operation of appending to the list. Therefore, the output state summarizes the variables as follows:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
