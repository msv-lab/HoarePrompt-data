Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is even, then `f[1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `f[2]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3 but is divisible by 5, then the value of `g[3]` is included in the list `l`, and `j` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 7; otherwise, `f[5]` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 11; or `f[6]` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 13; or `f[7]` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 17; or `f[8]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 19; or `f[9]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 23; or `f[10]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 29; or `f[11]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 31; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged, while `j`, `l`, and `g[9]` remain unchanged.***
