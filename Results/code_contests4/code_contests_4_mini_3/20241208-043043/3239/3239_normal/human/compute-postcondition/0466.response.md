The variable `l` is assumed to be a list, and `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this operation. The statement `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l.**
