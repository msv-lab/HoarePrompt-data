Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `func_1()` continues to return a value greater than `k`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7 but is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 but is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 but is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1, with the values of `j`, `l`, and `g[10]` remaining unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 or 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `j`, `l`, and `g[10]` remain unchanged.***
