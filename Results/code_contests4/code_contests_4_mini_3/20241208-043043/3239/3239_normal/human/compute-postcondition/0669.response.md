Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and the value of `a[i]` is odd and satisfies several divisibility conditions. If `f[9]` is true, `l` now includes `g[9]`. Otherwise, if `f[9]` is false, `j` is set to 1, `l` now contains the current value of `j`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1.***
