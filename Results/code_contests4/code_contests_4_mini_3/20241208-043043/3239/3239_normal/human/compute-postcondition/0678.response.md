The code assigns the value of `j` to the 10th index of the list `g`. The variable `j` has been increased by 1, and `l` contains the current value of `j`, but `n`, `i`, and `l` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, we can only specify how `g` changes based on the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` has been increased by 1, `l` now contains the current value of `j`, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
