Postcondition: ***`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true, then `g[6]` is appended to `l`. Otherwise, if `f[6]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to `l`, and `g[6]` is assigned the updated value of `j`.***
