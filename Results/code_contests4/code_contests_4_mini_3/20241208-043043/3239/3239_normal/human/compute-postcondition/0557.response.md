The value of `g[11]` is assigned the current value of `j`. Since `j` has already been increased by 1 in the initial state, we use that updated value for the assignment. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `l` has `j` appended to it; `g[11]` is now equal to the updated value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `l` has `j` appended to it; `g[11]` is now equal to the updated value of `j`.**
