The code appends the value of `g[8]` to the list `l`. The initial state does not specify the values of `g` or `l`, but since `g[8]` is being accessed, we assume `g` is a list or similar structure with at least 9 elements. The values of `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the appending operation without altering other variables.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `g[8]` is appended to the list `l`.**
