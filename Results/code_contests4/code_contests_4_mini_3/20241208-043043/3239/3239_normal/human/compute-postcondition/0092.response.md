The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19; the element `a[i]` is divisible by 23, and `f[9]` is false.**
