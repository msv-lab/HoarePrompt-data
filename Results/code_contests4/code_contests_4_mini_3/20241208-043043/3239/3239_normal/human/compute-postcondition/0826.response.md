The code assigns the value of `j` to the 8th index of the list `g`. The previous value of `j`, which is increased by 1, is now included in `l`. However, we do not have a specific value for `j` before the increment. The value of `g[8]` will be equal to the current value of `j`, but since we do not know the initial value of `j`, we cannot determine the exact value assigned to `g[8]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[8]` is assigned the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[8]` is assigned the new value of `j`.**
