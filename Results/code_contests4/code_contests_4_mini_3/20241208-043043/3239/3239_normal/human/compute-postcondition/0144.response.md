The value of `g[3]` is assigned the current value of `j`, which has been increased by 1 in the previous statements. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `j` has been updated, and `l` now includes this updated value of `j`. The value of `g[3]` is now set to this updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the updated value of `j`, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the updated value of `j`, `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
