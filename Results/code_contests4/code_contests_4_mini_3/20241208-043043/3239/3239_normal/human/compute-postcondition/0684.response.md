The value of `l` is updated by appending the value of `g[11]`. The states of `n`, `i`, `func_1()`, `a[i]`, and `f[11]` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is true, and `l` now includes `g[11]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is true, and `l` now includes `g[11]`**.
