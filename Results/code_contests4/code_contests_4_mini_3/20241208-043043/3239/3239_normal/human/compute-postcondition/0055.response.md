Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 11. If `f[5]` is true, then `l` includes `g[5]`. If `f[5]` is false, then `j` is greater than 1, `l` has the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
