The code assigns the value of `j` to the 11th index of the list `g`. The value of `j` has been increased by 1 before this operation, so it holds its new value. The values of `n`, `i`, and the return value of `func_1()` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated state of `g` at index 11.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1; `l` now includes the new value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
