The value of `f[1]` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `f[1]` is not specified, but it can be inferred that `f[1]` was true before the increment since it is being incremented. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `g[1]`, and `l` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `f[1]` is incremented by 1, and the previous state of `f[1]` was true.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `f[1]` is incremented by 1, and the previous state of `f[1]` was true.**
