Postcondition: ***If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, and `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is incremented by 1; if not, and `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 11 but divisible by 13, `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1 while `g[7]`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged; if not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1; if `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is at least 2. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute a second time.***
