The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been previously stated to be increased by 1, but its exact value is not provided. Therefore, we note that `j` is now one unit greater than its previous value, which is unknown. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and there is no return value in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1; `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
