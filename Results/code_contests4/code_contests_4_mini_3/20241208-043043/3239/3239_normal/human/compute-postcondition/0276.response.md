Postcondition: ***Given that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2, if `a[i] % 19 == 0`, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, and `l` includes `g[10]`. If neither of these conditions are true but `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `f[11]` is increased by 1, while `g[11]`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
