The variable `j` is appended to the list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 prior to this operation, but its specific value is unknown. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, divisible by 17, `f[7]` is false, and `l` now includes the new value of `j`.
