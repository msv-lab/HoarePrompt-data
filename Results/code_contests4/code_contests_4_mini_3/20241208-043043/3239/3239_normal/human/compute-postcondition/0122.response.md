Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by the primes up to 29, and `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then a new element from `g[9]` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, then `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, with `g[9]` assigned the value of `j`, and `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
