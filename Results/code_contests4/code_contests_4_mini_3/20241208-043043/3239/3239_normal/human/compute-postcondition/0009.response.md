According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` list. If `args` contains at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `at_start` is False. 

Since `x` is currently the first element, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the second element of `args`, and `at_start` should be set to True (indicating that the first element was processed). 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` contains at least 2 test case inputs for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`args` contains at least 2 test case inputs, `x` is the second element in `args`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, a space has been written before `x`, and `at_start` is True**.
