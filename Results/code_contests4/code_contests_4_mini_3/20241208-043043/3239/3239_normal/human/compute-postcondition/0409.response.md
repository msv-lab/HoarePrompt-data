Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `a` is the result of `func_4()`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `f` is a list of 12 elements with `f[6]` being 1, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `l` is [0]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` remains an odd number not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is set to 1; if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[10]` is set to 1, `j` is 1, and `l` is updated to [1], with `g` possibly being a list of 12 elements containing one depending on the condition. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[10]` is set to 1, `j` is 0, `l` contains [0], and `g` is a list of 12 zeros. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is set to 1; otherwise, the last element of `f` is set to 1, with `g` potentially being a list of 12 zeros or a list of 11 zeros and 1, and `j` and `l` will change accordingly based on the conditions met.***
