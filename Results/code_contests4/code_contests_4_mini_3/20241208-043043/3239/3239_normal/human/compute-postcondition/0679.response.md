Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if `f[10]` is true, then `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23, and divisible by 29, while `g[10]` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the current value of `j`, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
