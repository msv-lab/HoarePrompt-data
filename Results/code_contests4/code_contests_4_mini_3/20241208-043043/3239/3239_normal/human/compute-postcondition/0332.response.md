Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `l` is either [0] or [1]. The element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, and `a[i]` is divisible by 7. If the fifth element of `f` is true (non-zero), then `l` remains [0]. Otherwise, `g[4]` is set to 1, `j` is incremented to 1, and `l` is updated to [1], while the fifth element of `f` remains 0.***
