According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
