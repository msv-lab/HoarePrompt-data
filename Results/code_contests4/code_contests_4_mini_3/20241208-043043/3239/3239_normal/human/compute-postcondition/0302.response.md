Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros where `f[1]` is true if the first condition is met, `g` is a list of 12 zeros unless the else condition is executed where `g[1]` becomes 1, `j` is 0 unless the else condition is executed where `j` becomes 1, `l` is now [0] if the first condition is met, otherwise, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, and the element `a[0]` is an even number.***
