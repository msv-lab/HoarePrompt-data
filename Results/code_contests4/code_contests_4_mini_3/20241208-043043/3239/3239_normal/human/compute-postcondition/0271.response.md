Postcondition: ***If `f[11]` is true, the operation to append `g[11]` to `l` is attempted. If `f[11]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` includes the new value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. In both cases, `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2.***
