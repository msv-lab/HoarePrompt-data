The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial value of `j` is 1, and since `l` is currently an empty list, after execution, `l` will contain the value `[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is divisible by 13, and `f[6]` is 0.**
