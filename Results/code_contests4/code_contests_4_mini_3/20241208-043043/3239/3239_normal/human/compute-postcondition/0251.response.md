The value of `j` is increased by 1 prior to this code snippet, but since the exact value of `j` after incrementing is not provided, it remains unspecified in the output state. The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
