The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. In this case, `sep` is a space (' '), so a space will be written to `sys.stdout`. The values of `args`, `x`, and `at_start` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`args` contains at least 1 test case input, `x` is the first element in `args`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and a space has been written to the output.**
