Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`. If `f[5]` is true, then `l` is modified to include `g[5]`, under the conditions that the value of `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, and divisible by 11. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, appended to the list `l`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
