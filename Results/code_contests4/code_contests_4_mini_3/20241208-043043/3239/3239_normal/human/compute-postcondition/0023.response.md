Postcondition: ***`args` contains a variable number of test case inputs, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sep` is ' ', `at_start` is False, and the value written to `file` is either the value of `kwargs['end']` if it exists or '\n' if it does not. If `flush` was True, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `flush` as it has been popped, and the `file.flush()` operation is executed, ensuring that all buffered output to `file` is written out immediately.***
