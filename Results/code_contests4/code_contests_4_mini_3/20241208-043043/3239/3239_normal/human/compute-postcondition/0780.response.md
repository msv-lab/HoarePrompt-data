According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 after the current iteration, making `i` equal to 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
