The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is 1, the list `l` will now contain the value 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is now a list containing 1, `a` is the result of `func_4()`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is now a list containing 1, `a` is the result of `func_4()`**.
