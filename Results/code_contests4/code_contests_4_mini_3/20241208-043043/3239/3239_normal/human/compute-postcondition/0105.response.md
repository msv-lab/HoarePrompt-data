Postcondition: ***`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 29. If `f[10]` is true, `g[10]` has been appended to the list `l`. Otherwise, `f[10]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the value of `j`, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
