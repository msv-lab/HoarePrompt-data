Postcondition: ***`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd and satisfies multiple divisibility conditions. If `f[8]` is true, then `l` now includes the element `g[8]`. If `f[8]` is false, the conditions on `a[i]` remain unchanged, `j` has been increased by 1, `j` has been appended to the list `l`, and `g[8]` is now equal to the incremented value of `j`.***
