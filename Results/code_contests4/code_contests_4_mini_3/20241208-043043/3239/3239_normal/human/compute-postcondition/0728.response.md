The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables, `n`, `i`, and the return value of `func_1()`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1**
