The code assigns the value of `j` to the 10th index of the list `g`. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and the value of `j` is assigned to `g[10]`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
