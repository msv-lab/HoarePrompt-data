The value of `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 and `l` now contains this updated value of `j`, we can conclude that `g[2]` will hold the same value as `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `f[2]` is false, `j` has been increased by 1, `l` contains `j`, and `g[2]` is now equal to `j`.
