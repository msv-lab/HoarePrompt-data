The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1, but the exact value is not provided in the initial state. The variables `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n` and `i`, while noting that `j` has been appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
