The variable `j` is increased by 1 before this line of code, so it already has a value greater than or equal to 1. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.**
