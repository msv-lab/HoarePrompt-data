Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, and the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 19. If `f[8]` is true, then `g[8]` is appended to `l`. If `f[8]` is false, then `j` is the incremented value, and `j` is appended to `l`, while `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
