The code `l.append(g[11])` appends the value of `g[11]` to the list `l`. Since `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `g[11]` is `0`. Therefore, the value `0` is appended to the list `l`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

The output state reflects that the list `l` now contains one element, which is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, `a[i]` is divisible by 31, and `f[11]` is true (non-zero)**.
