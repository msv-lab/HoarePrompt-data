The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the increment of `j`. 

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd (not divisible by 2), the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 7, the value of `f[4]` is false, and `j` is increased by 1.**
