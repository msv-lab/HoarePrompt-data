The variable `file` is assigned the value `sys.stdout`, which indicates that it is writing to standard output. The variable `x` is the second element in `args`, and since it is prefixed with a space, the string representation of `x` will be written without any additional space since `at_start` is True. Therefore, the output state is: `args` contains at least 2 test case inputs, `x` is the second element in `args`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, a space has been written before `x`, and `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`args` contains at least 2 test case inputs, `x` is the second element in `args`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, a space has been written before `x`, and `at_start` is True; `file` has written `str(x)` without additional space.**
