The operation `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j`, which is 1, to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `l` is an empty list, so after the execution, `l` will contain the single element `[1]`. The other variables, `n`, `i`, `f`, `g`, `a`, and their respective conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and `f[4]` is 0.**
