The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[0]` is an even number, and the second element of `f` is 0.**
