The value of `j` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `j` has increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, and `j` is increased by 1.**
