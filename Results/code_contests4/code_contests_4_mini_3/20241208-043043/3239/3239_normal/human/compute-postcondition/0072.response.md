The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, divisible by 17, and `f[7]` is false; `j` is increased by 1.
