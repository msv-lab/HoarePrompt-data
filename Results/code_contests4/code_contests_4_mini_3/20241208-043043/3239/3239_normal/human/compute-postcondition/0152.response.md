The value of `f[4]` is incremented by 1. This operation affects only `f[4]`, and the previous state of `f[4]` is not provided, but it is implied that it was a boolean or integer value. The other variables `l`, `g[4]`, `j`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `f[4]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `f[4]` is incremented by 1.**
