The code `l.append(g[7])` appends the value of `g[7]` to the list `l`. Since `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `g[7]` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after execution, `l` will contain one element, which is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `l` contains one element which is 0, `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and the value of `f[7]` is true (non-zero).**
