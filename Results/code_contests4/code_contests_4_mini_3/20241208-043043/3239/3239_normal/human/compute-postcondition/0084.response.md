The value at index 8 of the list `g` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, but the exact value of `j` before the increment is not provided. Since `j` is not specified, the output state will reflect that `g[8]` is now equal to the incremented value of `j`.

Output State: **`func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, the element `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 19, the value of `f[8]` is false, `j` has been increased by 1, `j` has been appended to the list `l`, and `g[8]` is now equal to the incremented value of `j`.**
