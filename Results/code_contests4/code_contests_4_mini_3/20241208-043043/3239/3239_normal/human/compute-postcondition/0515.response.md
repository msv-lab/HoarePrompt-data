The assignment `g[4] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the 5th index of the list `g`. However, there is no information provided about the value of `j` or the previous state of variable `g`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state focuses on the impact of the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
