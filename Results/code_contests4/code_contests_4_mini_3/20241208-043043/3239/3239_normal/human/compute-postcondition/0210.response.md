The value of `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has already been increased by 1, but the exact value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, `g[1]` will hold the new value of `j`, but we cannot specify what that value is. The state of `l` is also not directly affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`; `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
