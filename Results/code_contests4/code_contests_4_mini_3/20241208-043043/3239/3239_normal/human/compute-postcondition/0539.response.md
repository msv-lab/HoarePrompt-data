The code assigns the value of `j` to the 8th index of the list `g`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l` are not directly affected by this assignment, but we need to understand what `j` is before the assignment. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but we do not know its specific value prior to this increase. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `g[8]` is now assigned the value of `j`, which is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is unknown (increased by 1), `l` has `j` appended to it, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
