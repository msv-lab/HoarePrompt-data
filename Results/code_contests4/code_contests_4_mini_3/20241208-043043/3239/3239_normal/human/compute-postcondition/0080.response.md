The code `l.append(g[8])` appends the value of `g[8]` to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `g` has an index 8 that can be accessed, and `l` is a list that will now contain one additional element. The existing state of `l` is not specified, but it will grow by one element. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd and satisfies multiple divisibility conditions, `f[8]` is true, and `l` now includes the element `g[8]`.
