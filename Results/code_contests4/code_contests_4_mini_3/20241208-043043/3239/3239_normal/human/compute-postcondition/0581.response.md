According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The state indicates that `func_1()` was called, and it must return a value greater than `k`. However, we do not have information about the value of `k`. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0, which means `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0. Additionally, the loop variable `i` will start at 0.

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and ensure that `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`**
