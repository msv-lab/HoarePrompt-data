The value of `f[10]` is incremented by 1. Since `f[10]` is initially true, the condition `f[10]` being true implies that `l` will be modified to include `g[10]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `g[10]` do not change as a result of this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f[10]` is now incremented by 1, and `l` includes `g[10]`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f[10]` is now incremented by 1, and `l` includes `g[10]**
