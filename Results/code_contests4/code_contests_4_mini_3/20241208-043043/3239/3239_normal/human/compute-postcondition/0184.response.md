The value of `j` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `j` has been increased but does not specify its new value. The states of the other variables `func_1()`, `n`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1**
