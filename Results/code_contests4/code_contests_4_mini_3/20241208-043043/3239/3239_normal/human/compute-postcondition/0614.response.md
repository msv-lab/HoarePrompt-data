The value of `l` is affected by the code, as `g[4]` is appended to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `g[4]` is assumed to be a defined value since it is being referenced. Therefore, `l` is updated with the value of `g[4]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 7, the value of `f[4]` is true, and `l` has been updated to include `g[4]`.**
