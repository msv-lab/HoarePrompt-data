The code assigns the value of `j` to the 7th index of the list `g`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, but the impact on the variable `g` is direct through the assignment. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. Assuming `g` is a list with at least 8 elements, the previous value of `g[7]` is overwritten by the current value of `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1; `j` is the current value after being increased by 1; `g[7]` is now assigned the value of `j`.**
