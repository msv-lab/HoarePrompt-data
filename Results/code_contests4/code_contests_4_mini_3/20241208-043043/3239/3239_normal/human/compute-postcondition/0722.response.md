The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and the return value of `func_1()`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1**
