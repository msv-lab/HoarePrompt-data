The value of `f[3]` is incremented by 1, but the initial state does not specify its previous value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `g`, and `l`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is unchanged, `f[3]` is increased by 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is unchanged, `f[3]` is increased by 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k.**
