Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1 and `l` is updated by appending `g[9]`. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
