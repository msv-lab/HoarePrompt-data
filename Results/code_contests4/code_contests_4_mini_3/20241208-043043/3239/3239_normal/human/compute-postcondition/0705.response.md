The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided, only that it is greater than its initial state. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `j` is appended to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `j` is appended to `l`.**
