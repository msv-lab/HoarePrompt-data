The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this, but its specific value is not provided. The variable `n` and `i` remain unchanged and do not affect the output of this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
