Postcondition: ***`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, and divisible by 17. If `f[7]` is true, `g[7]` is appended to the list `l`. If `f[7]` is false, `l` now includes the new value of `j`, and `g[7]` is equal to `j`.***
