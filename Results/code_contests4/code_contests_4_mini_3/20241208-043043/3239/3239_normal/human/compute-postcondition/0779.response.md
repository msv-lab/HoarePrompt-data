Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`. If `a[i]` is even, then `f[1]` is incremented by 1 and the previous state of `f[1]` was true. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `f[2]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1. If not, if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1, while the values of `j`, `l`, and `g[10]` remain unchanged.***
