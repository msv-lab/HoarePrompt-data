Output State: **`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`; `f` is a list of integers, `g` is a list of integers, `j` is the total count of new entries, `l` is a list containing the values of `j`, a value has been returned from `func_8(max(l))`, and for the loop to execute again `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`.**
