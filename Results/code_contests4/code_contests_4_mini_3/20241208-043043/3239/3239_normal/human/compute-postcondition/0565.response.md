Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 and `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1, while `g[7]`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is at least 2. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute a second time.***
