The function `func_7` does not take any parameters directly as input. Instead, it handles multiple test cases, where for each test case, it processes a positive integer `n` followed by `n` composite integers `a_i`. The integers `a_i` are guaranteed to be composite numbers, and the constraints ensure that `n` can range from 1 to 1000 and each `a_i` can range from 4 to 1000. The total sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10,000.

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed, but it is implied that the function processes the composite integers in some way for each test case. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to handle multiple test cases consisting of composite integers and perform operations based on those inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases consisting of a positive integer n followed by n composite integers a_i, where 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, and returns results based on the operations performed on these integers.**
