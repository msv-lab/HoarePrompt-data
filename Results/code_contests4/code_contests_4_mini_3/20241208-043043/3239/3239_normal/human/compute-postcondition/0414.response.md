Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `a` is the result of `func_4()`. If `a[i]` is even, then `f` is a list of 12 zeros with `f[1]` set to 1, `g` remains a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, and `l` is now [0]. If `a[i]` is odd, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `f` is updated to have `f[2]` set to 1, `g` remains a list of 12 zeros, and `l` contains either [0] or [1] depending on the truthiness of `f[2]`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, it is also not divisible by 5, 7, or 11, with further updates to `f`, `g`, `j`, and `l` depending on other divisibility conditions. In all cases, `j` is updated to 1 if the else condition is executed.***
