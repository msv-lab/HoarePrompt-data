The value of `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, which has been increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, `g[4]` now holds the incremented value of `j`. The other variables are not affected. The output state reflects that `g[4]` has been updated based on the value of `j`.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the value of `j`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
