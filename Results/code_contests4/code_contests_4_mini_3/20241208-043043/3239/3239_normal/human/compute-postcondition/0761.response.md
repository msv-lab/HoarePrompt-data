Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, if `f[10]` is true, then `l` is updated to include the value `g[10]`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, the new value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
