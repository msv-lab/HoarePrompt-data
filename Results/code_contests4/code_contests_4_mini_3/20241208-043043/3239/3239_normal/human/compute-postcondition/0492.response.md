Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is even, then `f[1]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is odd and divisible by 3, then `f[2]` is increased by 1, while `g[2]` and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3 but is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 but is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is increased by 1, with `g[4]`, `j`, and the list `l` remaining undetermined. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7 but is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1. If it is not divisible by 11 but is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if `f[6]` is true, `g[6]` is appended to `l`; otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, appended to `l`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, the program checks divisibility by 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31, incrementing `f[7]`, `f[8]`, `f[9]`, `f[10]`, and `f[11]` respectively if applicable. Additionally, if `n` remains greater than 1, the loop can execute a second time.***
