The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `a` is the result of `func_4()`, the element `a[i]` is an odd number, and `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and the element `f[2]` is 0.
