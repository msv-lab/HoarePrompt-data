The code `f[8] += 1` increments the value of `f[8]` by 1. The previous value of `f[8]` is not specified, but it is now greater than or equal to 1 after the increment. 

The other variables such as `n`, `i`, `a[i]`, `j`, `l`, and `g[8]` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `f[8]` has been modified, if it was previously false (0), it is now true (1). This change means that `l` will include `g[8]` if the conditions were previously met.

The overall status of the variables remains unchanged except for `f[8]`, which is now incremented. Therefore, the output state is: `f[8]` is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`f[8]` is now incremented by 1.**
