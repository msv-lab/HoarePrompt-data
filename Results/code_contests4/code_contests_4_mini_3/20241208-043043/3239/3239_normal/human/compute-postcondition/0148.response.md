The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.**
