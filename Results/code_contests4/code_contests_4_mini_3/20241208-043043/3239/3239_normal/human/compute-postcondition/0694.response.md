Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`. If `a[i]` is odd and satisfies all divisibility conditions, increment `f[8]` by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 19. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is odd and satisfies the divisibility conditions, increment `f[9]` by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then increment `f[10]` by 1. If `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29 and is divisible by 31, then increment `f[11]` by 1. All other variables `j`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged.***
