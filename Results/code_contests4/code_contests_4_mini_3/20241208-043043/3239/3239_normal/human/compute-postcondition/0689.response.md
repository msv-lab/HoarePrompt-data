Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and divisible by 31. If `f[11]` is true, then `l` includes `g[11]`. If `f[11]` is false, then `j` is increased by 1 and appended to `l`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
