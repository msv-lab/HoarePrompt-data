Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `f` is a list of 12 elements where `f[10]` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, otherwise the last element of `f` is set to 1. `g` is a list of 12 zeros or a list of 11 zeros and 1 depending on the condition. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the value of `f[10]`, `l` is either [0] or [1] accordingly, and `a` is the result of `func_4()` with `a[i]` being an odd number, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and if not divisible by 29, it is divisible by 31.***
