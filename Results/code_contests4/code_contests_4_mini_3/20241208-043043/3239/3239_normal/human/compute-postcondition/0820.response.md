In the given code snippet, `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `g[7]`. The other variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j` which is not specified.**
