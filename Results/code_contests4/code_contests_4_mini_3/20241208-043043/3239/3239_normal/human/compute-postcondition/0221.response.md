The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `j` or the contents of `l` before the append operation. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **variable `j` has been increased by 1; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; and the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
