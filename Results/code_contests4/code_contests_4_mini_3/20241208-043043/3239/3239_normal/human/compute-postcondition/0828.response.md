`f[8]` is incremented by 1. The value of `f[8]` changes, but the other variables `n`, `i`, `l`, `j`, and `g[8]` are not directly affected by this operation. Since we don't have the initial value of `f[8]`, we cannot specify the exact new value, but we can note that it is now one greater than before. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `f[8]` is now incremented by 1, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `f[8]` is now incremented by 1**
