The list `l` is being modified by appending the current value of `j` to it. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but the exact value of `j` is not provided. However, the action of appending will not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new state of `l` after appending an incremented value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `func_1()` returns a value greater than `k`, the value of `a[i]` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, the value of `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, the value of `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to `l`.**
