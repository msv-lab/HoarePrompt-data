The variable `g` at index `3` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` has been increased by 1 from its previous state, but the specific value of `j` is unknown in this context. The values of `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` has been increased by 1, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` has been increased by 1, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j**.
