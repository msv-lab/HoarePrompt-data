You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A positive integer is called composite if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.

Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,…,a_n.

She wants to choose an integer m ≤ 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:

  * for each color from 1 to m there is at least one element of this color; 
  * each element is colored and colored exactly one color; 
  * the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, i.e. \gcd(a_i, a_j)>1 for each pair i, j if these elements are colored the same color. 



Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.

Alice showed already that if all a_i ≤ 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m ≤ 11.

Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the amount of numbers in a sequence a.

The second line of the test case contains n composite integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case print 2 lines. The first line should contain a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 11) — the number of used colors. Consider colors to be numbered from 1 to m. The second line should contain any coloring that satisfies the above conditions. Print n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m), where c_i is the color of the i-th element. If there are multiple solutions then you can print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Remember that each color from 1 to m should be used at least once. Any two elements of the same color should not be coprime (i.e. their GCD should be greater than 1).

2 1
11
4 7 8 10 7 3 10 7 7 8 3 1 1 5 5 9 2 2 3 3 4 11 6

Note

In the first test case, \gcd(6,10)=2, \gcd(6,15)=3 and \gcd(10,15)=5. Therefore, it's valid to color all elements the same color. Note that there are other colorings which satisfy Alice's requirement in this test case.

In the second test case there is only one element of each color, so the coloring definitely satisfies Alice's requirement.
