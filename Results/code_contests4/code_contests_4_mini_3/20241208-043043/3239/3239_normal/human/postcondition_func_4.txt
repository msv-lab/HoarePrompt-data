The function reads multiple test cases of composite integers from a specified input file, expecting each test case to start with a positive integer indicating the number of composite integers followed by the composite integers themselves. However, it lacks any processing logic for the integers and does not return any output directly, as it only redirects standard input and output streams. Therefore, the actual functionality is limited to setting up file input/output without performing any computations or returning values.
