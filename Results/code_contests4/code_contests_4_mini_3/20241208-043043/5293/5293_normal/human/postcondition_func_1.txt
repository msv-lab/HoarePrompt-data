The function accepts a variable number of arguments and keyword arguments. It writes the string representation of each argument to a specified output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separating them with a specified separator (defaulting to a space), and ending with a specified string (defaulting to a newline). It does not handle or process the initial integer `t` or integer `n` or the list of integers mentioned in the annotations. Therefore, the function does not directly relate to the number of test cases or the specifics of the input integers and sequences as described in the annotations.
