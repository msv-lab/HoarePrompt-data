#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), for each test case n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that is non-decreasing (a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ … ≤ a_n).
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `n` is the last input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; the value returned from `func_2` is the count of the most common element in the last list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a non-decreasing list of `n` integers. It then calls `func_2` with the count of the most common element in the list. However, it does not return any value or output to the user, nor does it handle cases where the input may not conform to the expected format (e.g., if `n` does not match the number of elements in list `a`).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) forming a non-decreasing sequence.

        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file.write(str(x))` has written all elements of `args` to `file` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` has written a newline character or the value of `kwargs['end']` if it exists. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, then `file.flush()` has executed, ensuring that any buffered output is written out.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable number of arguments and keyword arguments. It writes the string representation of each argument to a specified output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separating them with a specified separator (defaulting to a space), and ending with a specified string (defaulting to a newline). It does not handle or process the initial integer `t` or integer `n` or the list of integers mentioned in the annotations. Therefore, the function does not directly relate to the number of test cases or the specifics of the input integers and sequences as described in the annotations.
