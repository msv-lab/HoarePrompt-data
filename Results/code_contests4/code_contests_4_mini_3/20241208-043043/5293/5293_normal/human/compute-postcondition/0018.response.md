The value of `at_start` is set to False, but it was already False in the initial state, so there is no change. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file.**
