The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` (which is a space character) to the output stream represented by `file`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`**
