The loop writes each element of `args` to `file`, separating them with `sep`, but only after the first element. The variable `at_start` controls whether the separator is written before the current element. After all iterations of the loop have executed, `at_start` will be `False`, indicating that the separator has already been used. 

If `args` is an empty iterable, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains `True`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file.write(str(x))` has written all elements of `args` to `file` separated by `sep`.**
