According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute multiple times. At the end of the last iteration, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`. After the last iteration, `x` will have moved to the next element in `args`. For the loop to execute one more time, the iterable must have at least 3 elements, and `x` must be updated to the next element in the iterable.

State: **`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`**
