The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, constrained to be between 1 and 100 (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it also accepts an integer `n`, which is also constrained to be between 1 and 100 (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that form a non-decreasing sequence and are each constrained to be within the range from 1 to `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).

The function processes these inputs and produces an unspecified output based on the provided test cases and sequences. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers in a non-decreasing sequence. The specific output of the function based on these inputs is not detailed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers forming a non-decreasing sequence.**
