According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute if `args` contains at least one element. The current state indicates that `at_start` is set to True, but it does not provide information about the contents of `args`. 

For the loop to be executed the first time, `args` must be a non-empty iterable (like a list or tuple) and `x` will take the value of the first element in `args`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable and `x` is the first element in `args`.**
