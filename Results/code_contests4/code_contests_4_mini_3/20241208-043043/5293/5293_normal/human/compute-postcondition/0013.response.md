The value of `at_start` is assigned as `False`, but it was already `False` before this assignment, so there is no change to its value. The states of the other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args` and has been written to `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args` and has been written to `file`**.
