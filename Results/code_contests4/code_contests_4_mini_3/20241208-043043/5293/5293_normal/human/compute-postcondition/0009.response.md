According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has more elements, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `args`, and for the loop to execute again, `args` must have at least one more element after the current `x`. 

Since the iteration is over `args`, and `x` represents the first element, to execute the loop one more time, `x` must be updated to the next element in `args`, and we need to ensure that there is a second element available.

State: **`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`**
