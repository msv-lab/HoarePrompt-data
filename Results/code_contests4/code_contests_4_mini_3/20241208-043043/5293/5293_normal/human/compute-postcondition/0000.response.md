Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`) forming a non-decreasing sequence; the code prints values to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default.**
