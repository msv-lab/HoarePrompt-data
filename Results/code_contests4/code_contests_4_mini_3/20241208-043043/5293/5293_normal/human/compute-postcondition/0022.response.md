Output State: **`sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable; `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` has written a newline character or the value of `kwargs['end']` if it exists, and the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, indicating that the output is flushed; `file.flush()` has executed, ensuring that any buffered output is written out.**
