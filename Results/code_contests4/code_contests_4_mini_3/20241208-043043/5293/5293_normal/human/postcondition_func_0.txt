The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a non-decreasing list of `n` integers. It then calls `func_2` with the count of the most common element in the list. However, it does not return any value or output to the user, nor does it handle cases where the input may not conform to the expected format (e.g., if `n` does not match the number of elements in list `a`).
