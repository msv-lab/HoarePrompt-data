Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `A_i` are integers such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 1000000000 for `i` from 1 to `N`, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs`, and if `at_start` is False, then `file.write(sep)` is executed prior to this code, writing the value of `sep` to the file; `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file.**
