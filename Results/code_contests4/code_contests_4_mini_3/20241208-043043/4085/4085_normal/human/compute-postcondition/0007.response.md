The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. Based on this state, if `at_start` is `False`, the code indicates that prior to writing the value of `x` to the file, `file.write(sep)` would be executed, which writes the value of `sep` to the file. Since the specific values of `sep`, `file`, and `x` are not provided, we cannot define their outputs explicitly. However, we can confirm that `at_start` being `False` leads to the execution of `file.write(sep)`.

Output State: **`at_start` is False; `file.write(sep)` is executed prior to writing `x` to the file.**
