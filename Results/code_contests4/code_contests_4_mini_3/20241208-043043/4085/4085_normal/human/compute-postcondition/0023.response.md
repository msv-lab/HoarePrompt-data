The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 100000\), and \(A_i\) are integers such that \(1 \leq A_i \leq 1000000000\) for \(i\) from \(1\) to \(N\). The output or return value of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details on the function's output, we are unable to define its functionality clearly.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but operates with constraints on N and A_i, though the return value is not specified.**
