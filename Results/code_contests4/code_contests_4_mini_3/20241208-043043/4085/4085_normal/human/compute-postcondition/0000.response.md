The code snippet provided affects the variables `sep` and `file`. The method `kwargs.pop()` is used to remove the specified keys from the `kwargs` dictionary and return their corresponding values. The initial state specifies that `sep` and `file` are being assigned values from `kwargs`, with default values of `b' '` and `sys.stdout`, respectively, if those keys do not exist in `kwargs`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `kwargs`, we cannot determine the exact values assigned to `sep` and `file`. The output state will reflect this uncertainty.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000; `A_i` are integers such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 1000000000 for `i` from 1 to `N`; `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` with default values `b' '` and `sys.stdout` respectively.**
