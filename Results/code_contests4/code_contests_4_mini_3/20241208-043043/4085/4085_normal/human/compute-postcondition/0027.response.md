The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `N` and `A`. `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, and `A` is a list of N integers where each element `A[i]` is in the range 1 <= A[i] <= 1000000000. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the values in the list `A`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N and a list A of N integers, and returns a specific result based on the values in A.**
