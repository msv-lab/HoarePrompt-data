Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `A_i` are integers such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 1000000000 for `i` from 1 to `N`, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs`, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable and `x` is the first element of `args`***
