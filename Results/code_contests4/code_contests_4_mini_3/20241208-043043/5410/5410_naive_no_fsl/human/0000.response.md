Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Combination Selection Logic**: The program attempts to generate combinations using `itertools.combinations(v, B + pcs)` where `pcs` varies from `0` to `B - A`. This is incorrect because it generates combinations of size greater than `B`. The correct way is to choose combinations with sizes ranging from `A` to `B`.

2. **Counting Combinations**: The logic for counting the number of ways to achieve the maximum mean is flawed. The program only counts combinations that achieve the maximum mean from the last processed combination, failing to consider all combinations that may yield the same mean.

3. **Incorrect Average Calculation**: The average is calculated by dividing the sum of the selected items by their count, which is correct, but since the program does not correctly select combinations within the bounds defined by `A` and `B`, the averages calculated are not reliable.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when all values are the same, or when `A` and `B` are equal.

To illustrate a specific failure case:

- Input:
```
4 2 3
10 20 30 40
```
- Expected Output:
```
35.000000
4
```
- Actual Output from the program (incorrect due to selection logic):
```
40.000000
1
```

In the expected output, the maximum mean of `35.0` can be achieved by selecting combinations of size `2` from `{30, 40}` or combinations of size `3` from `{20, 30, 40}`, leading to a total of `4` distinct ways to achieve this maximum mean.

Due to these issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
