The function `func` accepts three integers `N`, `A`, and `B`, which define the size and range of combinations to be processed from a subsequent list of integers `v`. It computes all combinations of the integers in `v`, taking `B + pcs` elements at a time, where `pcs` ranges from `0` to `B - A`. For each combination, it calculates the average and tracks the maximum average found across all combinations, along with the count of how many combinations yield this maximum average.

The function does not handle cases where the input might not meet the constraints (e.g., `N`, `A`, and `B` being outside their defined ranges). Additionally, if the list `v` does not contain enough elements to form the combinations specified, it may lead to errors. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `N`, `A`, and `B`, and a list of integers `v`. It calculates the maximum average of all combinations of the integers in `v` taken `B + pcs` at a time for `pcs` in the range from `0` to `B - A`, and counts how many combinations yield that maximum average, returning these two values. **
