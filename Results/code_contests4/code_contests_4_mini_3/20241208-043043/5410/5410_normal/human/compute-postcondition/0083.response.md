Postcondition: ***`perm` is a list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 2` at a time with at least 3 combinations; `cand` is the third combination in `perm`; `average` is the float value of the sum of elements in `cand` divided by the length of `cand`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultCount` is incremented by 1.***
