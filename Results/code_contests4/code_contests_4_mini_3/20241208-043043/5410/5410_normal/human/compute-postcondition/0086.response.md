Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations of `v` taken `B + pcs` at a time for `pcs` in the range from 0 to `B - A`; `resultCount` is the number of combinations that produced the maximum average across all iterations; `pcs` is `B - A`; the value of `resultValue` is printed.**
