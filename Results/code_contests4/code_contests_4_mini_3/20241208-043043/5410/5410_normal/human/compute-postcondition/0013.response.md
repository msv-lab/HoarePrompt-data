The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `resultCount` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 0; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is equal to `average`; `resultCount` is increased by 1.
