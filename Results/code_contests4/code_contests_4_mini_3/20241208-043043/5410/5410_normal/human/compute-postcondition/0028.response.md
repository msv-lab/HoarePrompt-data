Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 0; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`. If `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
