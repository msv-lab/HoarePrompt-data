The variable `average` is assigned the value of `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`. The list `cand` is assumed to contain integers, and its sum is calculated, followed by dividing that sum by the length of `cand` to compute the average. The values of `N`, `A`, `B`, and `pcs` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`.**
