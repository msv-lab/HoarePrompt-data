The code assigns the value of `average` to `resultValue`. The previous state indicates that `resultValue` is less than `average`, but now it will be equal to `average`. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 0; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is now equal to `average`.**
