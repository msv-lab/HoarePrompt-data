Postcondition: ***`perm` is a list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 2` at a time with at least 1 combination; `cand` is the first combination in `perm`; `average` is the float value of the sum of the elements in `cand` divided by the length of `cand`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is now equal to `average` and `resultCount` is 1. If `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultCount` is increased by 1; otherwise, `resultCount` remains unchanged.***
