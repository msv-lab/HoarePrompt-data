Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`, `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`, `pcs` is 1, `resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates, `resultCount` is the number of candidates that produced the maximum average, `perm` is a non-empty list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 1` at a time, `cand` is the first element in `perm`, `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand), and the `resultValue` is equal to `average`.***
