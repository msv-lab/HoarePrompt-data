`resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`. The value of `average` is calculated as the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`. Since the exact value of `average` cannot be determined from the information provided regarding `cand`, we can only state that `resultValue` will hold the same value as `average`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 0; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`.**
