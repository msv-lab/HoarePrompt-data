The variable `resultCount` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `v_i` are integers such that 1 <= `v_i` <= 10^{15} for each `i` in the range 1 to `N`; `v` is a list of integers; `resultValue` is 0; `resultCount` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `v_i` are integers such that 1 <= `v_i` <= 10^{15} for each `i` in the range 1 to `N`; `v` is a list of integers; `resultValue` is 0; `resultCount` is 0**.
