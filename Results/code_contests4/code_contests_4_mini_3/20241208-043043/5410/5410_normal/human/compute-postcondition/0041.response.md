Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`, `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`, `pcs` is 1, `resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates, `resultCount` is increased by 1 if `resultValue` equals `average`, and `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand) where `cand` is the first element in `perm`, a non-empty list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 1` at a time.***
