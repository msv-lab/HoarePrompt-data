Postcondition: ***`perm` is a list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 2` at a time with at least 2 combinations; `cand` is the second combination in `perm`; `average` is the float result of the sum of `cand` divided by its length. If `resultValue` equals `average`, then `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
