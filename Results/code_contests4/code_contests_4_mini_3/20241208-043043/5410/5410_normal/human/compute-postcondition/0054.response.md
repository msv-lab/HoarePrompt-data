The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `resultCount` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`; `resultCount` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`; `resultCount` is increased by 1.**
