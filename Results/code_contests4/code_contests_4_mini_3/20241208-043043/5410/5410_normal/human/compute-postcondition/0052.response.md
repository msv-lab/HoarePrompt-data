`resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`. The previous value of `average` is computed based on the elements in `cand`, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. The other variables `N`, `A`, `B`, `pcs` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`.**
