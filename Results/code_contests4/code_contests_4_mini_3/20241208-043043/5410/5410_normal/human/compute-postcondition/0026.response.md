The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value of 1. The initial states of other variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `pcs`, `average`, and `resultValue`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 0; `average` is derived from `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`; `resultCount` is 1.
