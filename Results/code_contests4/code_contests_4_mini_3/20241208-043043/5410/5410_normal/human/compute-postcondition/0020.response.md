The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, so the output state indicates that `resultCount` has been increased. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 0; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultCount` is increased by 1.**
