According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `perm`. If `perm` has at least one combination, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is unchanged. For the loop to be executed the first time, `perm` must contain at least one combination, and `cand` will be the first combination in the list. 

State: **`perm` is a list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 2` at a time with at least 1 combination, `cand` is the first combination in `perm`**
