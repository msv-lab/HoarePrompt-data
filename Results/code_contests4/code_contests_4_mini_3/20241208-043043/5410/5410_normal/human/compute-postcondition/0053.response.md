`resultCount` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, so the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`; `resultCount` is 1.
