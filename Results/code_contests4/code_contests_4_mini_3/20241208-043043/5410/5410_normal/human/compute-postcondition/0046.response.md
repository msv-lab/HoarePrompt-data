The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value 1. The other variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `pcs`, `average`, and `resultValue`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`; `resultValue` is `average`; `resultCount` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`; `resultValue` is `average`; `resultCount` is 1.**
