The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input parameters. Instead, it processes input values of `N`, `A`, `B`, and a sequence of integers `v_i` which are provided in a specific format. 

Based on the provided constraints:
- `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 50 \).
- `A` and `B` are integers such that \( 1 \leq A, B \leq N \).
- Each `v_i` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq v_i \leq 10^{15} \) for each \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( N \).

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information, but it will process the values of `N`, `A`, `B`, and the sequence of integers `v_i` to yield a result based on the logic defined within the function.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept input values for `N`, `A`, `B`, and a sequence of integers `v_i`, and produce a result based on the internal processing of these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts input values for N, A, B, and a sequence of integers v_i, and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
