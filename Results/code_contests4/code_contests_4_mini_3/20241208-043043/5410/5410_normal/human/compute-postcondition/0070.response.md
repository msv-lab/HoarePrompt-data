According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `perm` list. Since `perm` contains at least 1 combination, the loop has executed once, and `cand` is currently the first combination in the list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `cand` must be the next combination in the `perm` list. Given that `cand` is currently the first combination, and the loop iterates over each combination in `perm`, `cand` will need to be updated to the second combination in the list. 

Additionally, since `perm` has at least one combination, there must be at least two combinations for the loop to execute again.

State: **`perm` is a list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 2` at a time with at least 2 combinations, `cand` is the second combination in `perm`.**
