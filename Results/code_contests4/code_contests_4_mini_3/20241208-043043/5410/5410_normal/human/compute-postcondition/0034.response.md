In the given code, `average` is calculated by taking the sum of the elements in `cand`, which is the first element of `perm`, and dividing it by the length of `cand`. Since `cand` is derived from `perm`, its value will depend on what that first element contains.

The values of `N`, `A`, and `B` do not directly affect the computation of `average`, but they set the constraints for the values of `A` and `B`. The value of `pcs`, `resultValue`, and `resultCount` also remain unchanged by this operation.

Thus, the output state will reflect the computation of `average` based on the specific values contained in `cand`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`, `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`, `pcs` is 1, `resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates, `resultCount` is the number of candidates that produced the maximum average, `perm` is a non-empty list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 1` at a time, `cand` is the first element in `perm`, `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`**
