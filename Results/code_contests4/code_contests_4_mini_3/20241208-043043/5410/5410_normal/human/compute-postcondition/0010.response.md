`resultCount` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `pcs`, `average`, `resultValue`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 0; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is now equal to `average`; `resultCount` is 1.
