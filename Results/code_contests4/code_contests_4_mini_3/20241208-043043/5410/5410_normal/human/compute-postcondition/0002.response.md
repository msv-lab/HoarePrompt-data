The variable `resultValue` is initialized to 0. The values of `N`, `A`, `B`, and the list `v` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `v_i` are integers such that 1 <= `v_i` <= 10^{15} for each `i` in the range 1 to `N`; `v` is a list of integers; `resultValue` is 0**.
