According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `perm` list. If the list has at least 3 combinations, the loop can execute for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` has at least 2 combinations, and `cand` is the second combination in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the `perm` must have at least 3 combinations, and `cand` must be updated to the third combination in the list.

State: **`perm` is a list of combinations of `v` taken `B + 2` at a time with at least 3 combinations, `cand` is the third combination in `perm`.**
