Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `pcs` is 1; `average` is the computed float average of the elements in `cand`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is equal to `average` and `resultCount` is 1. Otherwise, if `resultValue` equals `average`, then `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
