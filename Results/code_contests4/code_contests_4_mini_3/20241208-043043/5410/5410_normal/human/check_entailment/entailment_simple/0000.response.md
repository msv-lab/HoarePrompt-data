The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is appropriate for Python 2. In Python 3, it should be replaced with `input()`. This discrepancy can lead to errors when running the program in an environment that defaults to Python 3.

2. **Combination Logic**: The program attempts to generate combinations of items using `itertools.combinations(v, B + pcs)` where `pcs` varies from `0` to `B - A`. This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that it selects at least `A` items and at most `B` items. Instead, it mixes the ranges which can lead to selecting more items than intended or not enough.

3. **Counting Combinations**: The counting of combinations that yield the maximum average is flawed. It does not distinguish between the different counts of combinations that yield the maximum average for the specified range `[A, B]`. 

4. **Output Formatting**: The output format does not ensure that the arithmetic mean is printed with a precision that adheres to the problem's requirement of an absolute or relative error of at most \(10^{-6}\).

5. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `resultValue` is initialized to `0`, which could lead to issues if all values in `v` are negative or less than `0` if the constraints were different. However, in this case, all values are guaranteed to be positive.

To summarize, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items while ensuring the selection criteria of at least `A` and at most `B` items. It also does not properly count the number of ways to achieve this maximum mean.

Given these issues, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**
