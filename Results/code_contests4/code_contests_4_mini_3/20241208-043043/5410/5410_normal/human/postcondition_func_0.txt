The function accepts three integers `N`, `A`, and `B`, and a list of integers `v`. It calculates the maximum average of all combinations of the integers in `v` taken `B + pcs` at a time for `pcs` in the range from `0` to `B - A`, and counts how many combinations yield that maximum average, returning these two values.
