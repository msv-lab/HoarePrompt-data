To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program receives three integers `N`, `A`, and `B`, followed by `N` integer values.
2. **Output**: The program should output the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items, under the condition that at least `A` and at most `B` items are selected. Additionally, it should output the number of ways to achieve this maximum mean.

### Program Analysis:
- The program uses combinations to generate all subsets of items of lengths ranging from `A` to `B`.
- It calculates the average for each combination and tracks the maximum average found.
- The count of how many times this maximum average is achieved is also tracked.

### Critical Points to Check:
1. **Combinatorial Logic**: The loop `for pcs in range(B - A + 1)` suggests that it is trying to generate combinations from `A` to `B` items. However, `itertools.combinations(v, B + pcs)` does not vary the length correctly; it should generate combinations with lengths ranging from `A` to `B`, not just from `B` to `B + (B - A)`.

2. **Selection of Items**: The logic should ensure that when selecting combinations, it considers all valid combinations from `A` to `B`. The current implementation only accounts for combinations of size `B + pcs`, which can lead to missing combinations of size `A`.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output format must ensure that the maximum mean is printed with a precision that meets the problem's requirements (absolute or relative error of at most `10^{-6}`).

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the case:
```
5 2 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
According to the problem, the program should evaluate combinations of sizes 2 and 3. The maximum means for 2 items are:
- (4, 5) -> Mean = 4.5 (1 way)
For 3 items:
- (3, 4, 5) -> Mean = 4.0 (1 way)

The correct maximum mean here is 4.5 with 1 way. However, if the combinations generated do not include the combination (4, 5) or if the logic incorrectly combines beyond B, it could lead to incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle combinations of sizes from `A` to `B`, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem. As a result, it can miss valid combinations, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
