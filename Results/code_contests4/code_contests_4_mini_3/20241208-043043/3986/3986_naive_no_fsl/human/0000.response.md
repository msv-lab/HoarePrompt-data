To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the code itself.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of a rectangular parallelepiped given the areas of its three adjacent faces. These areas correspond to:
- Face area 1 (A1) = x * y
- Face area 2 (A2) = y * z
- Face area 3 (A3) = z * x

From the areas, we can derive the edge lengths:
- Let x = sqrt(A1 * A3 / A2)
- Let y = sqrt(A1 * A2 / A3)
- Let z = sqrt(A2 * A3 / A1)

The sum of all edges of the parallelepiped can then be calculated as:
\[ \text{Sum of edges} = 4 \times (x + y + z) \]

### Code Analysis
The provided code is as follows:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(float, raw_input().split())
x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5
y = (b / c * a) ** 0.5
z = (c / a * b) ** 0.5
print(4 * (x + y + z))
```

#### Issues with the Code
1. **Incorrect Edge Length Calculation**: The formulas used in the code to calculate x, y, and z do not correspond to the required derivation from the face areas. The correct calculations should be:
   - \( x = \sqrt{\frac{a \cdot c}{b}} \)
   - \( y = \sqrt{\frac{a \cdot b}{c}} \)
   - \( z = \sqrt{\frac{b \cdot c}{a}} \)

2. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The code uses `raw_input()`, which is valid in Python 2 but would raise an error in Python 3. This is an important point as it affects the compatibility of the code.

3. **Potential Division by Zero**: While the problem states that areas are positive, the current implementation does not handle cases where the inputs might not be valid under different interpretations (if we were to generalize the problem).

### Counterexample
Consider the input:
```
1 1 1
```
Expected Output: 
- \( x = 1 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 1 \) â†’ Sum of edges = \( 4 \times (1 + 1 + 1) = 12 \)

Using the provided code:
- \( x = (1 / 1 * 1)^{0.5} = 1 \)
- \( y = (1 / 1 * 1)^{0.5} = 1 \)
- \( z = (1 / 1 * 1)^{0.5} = 1 \)
Output would also be `12`, which is correct in this case.

However, if we test with:
```
4 6 6
```
Expected Output: 
- The correct edge lengths should yield \( x, y, z \) such that the sum of edges equals 28, but the calculations in the code will not yield the correct values.

### Conclusion
Given the incorrect formulas for computing the edge lengths and potential compatibility issues with Python versions, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
