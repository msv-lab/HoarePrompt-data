Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses `float` for the areas and the calculations of the dimensions of the parallelepiped. The problem description specifies that the input consists of integers, and while the areas are derived from integer edge lengths, using floating-point arithmetic can lead to precision issues. Additionally, the program uses `raw_input()`, which is not defined in Python 3 (it is `input()` instead). The variable assignments for `x`, `y`, and `z` are calculated using the areas in a way that does not guarantee that the resulting dimensions will always be integers even though the edge lengths must be integers.

For instance, if the input areas are `4 6 6`, the calculations may yield non-integer values for `x`, `y`, and `z`, leading to a potential output that does not represent the correct sum of the edge lengths.

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description as it may produce incorrect outputs based on the way it handles input and calculations.
