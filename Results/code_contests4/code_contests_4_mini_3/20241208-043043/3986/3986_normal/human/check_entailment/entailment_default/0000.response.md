To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we start by analyzing both the description and the code.

**Problem description:**
We are to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of a rectangular parallelepiped, given the areas of its three faces that share a common vertex.

**Code:**
```python
(a, b, c) = map(float, raw_input().split())
x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5
y = (b / c * a) ** 0.5
z = (c / a * b) ** 0.5
print(4 * (x + y + z))
```

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The areas of the three faces are given as inputs, which represent the areas of the rectangles formed by the edges x, y, and z. The relationships between the areas and the edges are:
   - Area1 (a) = xy
   - Area2 (b) = xz
   - Area3 (c) = yz

2. The code attempts to derive the lengths x, y, and z from the areas. However, the formulas used to calculate x, y, and z appear to manipulate these areas in a way that might not correctly reverse the area calculations to yield the appropriate edge lengths.

3. The expression `x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5` is intended to calculate x based on the areas, but it does not clearly represent a valid transformation from the areas to the edges.

**Edge Cases:**
- We need to consider if the areas can lead to scenarios where the calculated lengths x, y, and z do not correspond to valid dimensions of a rectangular parallelepiped. For example, if the areas are significantly different, the derived edge lengths might not satisfy the requirements imposed by the areas.

**Output Hints:**
- The hints state that the function calculates dimensions based on provided areas and prints four times the sum of these dimensions. While they confirm that the function prints the expected final value, they do not clarify if the derived dimensions are accurate relative to the areas.

**Conclusion:**
The output hints do not provide additional valid cases or examples that guarantee the code correctly calculates the edge lengths based on the provided areas. The calculations in the code do not seem to be logically sound, and there is a potential for incorrect edge length estimation.

**Finding an Example:**
For areas given as `1 1 1`, the expected edge lengths would be `1, 1, 1`, which gives a sum of `12`, and this works. However, for areas `4 6 6`, the expected edge lengths would be `2, 2, 3`, leading to `28`. The calculations made by the code may not always lead to valid dimensions.

Therefore, since the program does not necessarily follow the problem description correctly for every case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly calculate edge lengths based on the areas provided, which means it cannot be deemed correct for all potential inputs.
