Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses `float` for the input areas and performs calculations that could lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point arithmetic. The problem description specifies that the input consists of three positive integers representing areas of the faces of a rectangular parallelepiped, but the code uses `float` and `raw_input()`, which indicates it was likely written for Python 2 and does not handle input correctly in Python 3.

Moreover, the calculation for the edge lengths derived from the areas does not verify the relationships between the areas adequately. The formula used to compute `x`, `y`, and `z` (the edge lengths of the parallelepiped) is based on the areas but does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. Specifically, it assumes that the areas can be manipulated in such a way to yield valid integer edge lengths, which might not always hold true. 

Finally, the output printed as `4 * (x + y + z)` does not represent the sum of all 12 edges correctly because the sum of all edges of a rectangular parallelepiped is actually `4 * (x + y + z)`, which is correct in that context. However, due to the floating-point arithmetic and the incorrect handling of integer inputs, the function may produce incorrect results. 

Thus, the program does not accurately follow the problem description's requirements for all potential cases.
