The variable `y` is assigned the value of `(b / c * a) ** 0.5`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers as floats. Hence, the expression calculates `b / c`, multiplies it by `a`, and then takes the square root of the result. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers as floats; `y` is the square root of `(b / c * a)`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers as floats; `y` is the square root of `(b / c * a)`**
