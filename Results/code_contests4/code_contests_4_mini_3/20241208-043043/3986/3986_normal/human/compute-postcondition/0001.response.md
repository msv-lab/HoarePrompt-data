The variable `x` is assigned the value of the expression `(a / b * c) ** 0.5`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` represent positive integers, which have been converted to floats. The calculation involves dividing `a` by `b`, multiplying the result by `c`, and then taking the square root of that product. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers as floats; `x` is calculated as `(a / b * c) ** 0.5`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers as floats; `x` is calculated as `(a / b * c) ** 0.5`**.
