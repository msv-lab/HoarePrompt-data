The variable `z` is assigned the value `(c / a * b) ** 0.5`. The previous values of the variables are `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are three positive integers as floats, and `y` is the square root of `(b / c * a)`. The calculation for `z` involves the division of `c` by `a`, then multiplying the result by `b`, and finally taking the square root of that product. 

However, since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `z`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship between the variables.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers as floats; `y` is the square root of `(b / c * a)`; `z` is `(c / a * b) ** 0.5`**
