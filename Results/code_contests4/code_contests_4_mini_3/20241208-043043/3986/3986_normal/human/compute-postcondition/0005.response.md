The function `func` accepts three parameters representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped. Each area is a positive integer greater than 0 and does not exceed 10,000. The function calculates the volume of the rectangular parallelepiped based on these areas. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integers representing the areas of the faces of a rectangular parallelepiped and return the calculated volume of that parallelepiped. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped and returns the calculated volume.**
