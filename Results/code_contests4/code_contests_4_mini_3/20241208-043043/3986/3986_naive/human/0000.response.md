To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the program and ensure that it accurately calculates the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of a rectangular parallelepiped given the areas of its three faces.

The provided program attempts to calculate the edge lengths \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) using the formulas derived from the areas of the faces \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
- \(a = x \cdot y\)
- \(b = y \cdot z\)
- \(c = z \cdot x\)

From these equations, the program derives the edge lengths using:
- \(x = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b} \cdot c}\)
- \(y = \sqrt{\frac{b}{c} \cdot a}\)
- \(z = \sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot b}\)

Finally, it computes the total edge length as \(4(x + y + z)\).

Now, let's consider whether this computation is always correct:

1. **Square Root Calculation**: The formula used to derive \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) is correct assuming \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the areas of the faces. However, the formulas should ensure that the dimensions derived from the areas are valid for all inputs. 

2. **Edge Case**: If we consider the areas \(a = 4\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = 6\):
   - The calculations yield:
     - \(x = \sqrt{\frac{4}{6} \cdot 6} = \sqrt{4} = 2\)
     - \(y = \sqrt{\frac{6}{6} \cdot 4} = \sqrt{4} = 2\)
     - \(z = \sqrt{\frac{6}{4} \cdot 6} = \sqrt{9} = 3\)

   The sum of the edges would be:
   \[
   4(x + y + z) = 4(2 + 2 + 3) = 4 \cdot 7 = 28
   \]
   This output is correct.

3. **Negative Inputs**: The function does not handle negative values or zero, but according to the problem statement, it is guaranteed that the areas are positive integers. Hence, we assume valid inputs.

4. **Type Handling**: The program uses `float` for input parsing. While this may work for the provided integer inputs, it could lead to precision issues if very large integers are used, but given the constraints of the problem (areas do not exceed \(10^4\)), this is acceptable.

5. **General Case**: Testing further combinations of areas (e.g., \(1, 1, 1\)) also yields correct outputs as calculated manually.

In conclusion, after considering the logic and potential edge cases, I find no scenario where the program fails to provide the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly computes the sum of the lengths of all edges of a rectangular parallelepiped given the areas of its three faces.
