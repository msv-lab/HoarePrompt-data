The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) followed by `n` integers (each ranging from 1 to 1,000,000,000). It calculates the sum of these integers. If the sum is odd, it subtracts the minimum integer from this sum, and then it prints the final result. If the sum is even, it prints the sum as is. The function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or where the input values do not meet the specified constraints.
