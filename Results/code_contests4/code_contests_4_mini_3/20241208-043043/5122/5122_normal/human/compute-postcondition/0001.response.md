The variable `vs` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input string from `raw_input()`, splits it into components, and converts each component into an integer. The value of `n` does not affect the assignment of `vs`, but it indicates that the input can contain up to `n` integers. 

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, and `vs` will be a map object containing integers from the input, the output state reflects the current state of `n` and the assignment of `vs`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object of integers from input.**
