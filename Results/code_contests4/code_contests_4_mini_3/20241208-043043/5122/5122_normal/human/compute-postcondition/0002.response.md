The variable `minO` is assigned the value `-1`. There are no other variables affected by this operation. The initial state of `n` and `vs` remains unchanged because no operations are performed that alter their values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object of integers from input; `minO` is -1**
