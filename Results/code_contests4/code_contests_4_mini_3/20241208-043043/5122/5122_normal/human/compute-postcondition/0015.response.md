The variable `minO` is assigned the value of `e`, which is the next integer from the `vs` map object. The states of the other variables (`n`, `vs`, `res`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `e` is the next integer from `vs`; `res` is adjusted by adding `e` to its previous value; `minO` is `e`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `e` is the next integer from `vs`; `res` is adjusted by adding `e` to its previous value; `minO` is `e`.**
