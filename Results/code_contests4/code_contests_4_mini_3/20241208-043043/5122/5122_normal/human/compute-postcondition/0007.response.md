The value of `minO` is assigned the value of `e`. According to the initial state, `minO` was either -1 or greater than `e`. Therefore, after this assignment, `minO` will now be equal to `e`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `minO` is now equal to `e`; `res` is increased by the value of `e`**.
