Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; if `minO` is -1 or `minO` is greater than `e`, then `minO` is updated to `e` and `res` is increased by the value of `e`. Otherwise, `minO` remains unchanged and `res` is not affected.***
