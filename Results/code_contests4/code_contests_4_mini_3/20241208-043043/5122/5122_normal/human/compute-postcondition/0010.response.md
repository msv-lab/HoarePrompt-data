The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `e`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it will increase. The other variables (`n`, `vs`, `minO`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `minO` remains unchanged; `res` increases by `e`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `minO` remains unchanged; `res` increases by `e.**
