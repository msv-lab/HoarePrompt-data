Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. 

1. **Input Reading Issue**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This would cause the program to fail when executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Card Presence Check**: The program initializes the dictionary `d` with `None` values and sets them to `True` when a card is present. However, it does not properly account for the situation where the card is absent. The check `if d[k][i]:` will skip printing cards that are present, but it will not handle the case where `d[k][i]` is `None`. It should check for `None` instead of `True`. 

3. **Output Order**: The order of output is correct in terms of suits (spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds) and ranks (from 1 to 13), but due to the issues in the logic for marking present cards, it will incorrectly print cards that are present instead of missing ones.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases appropriately, such as if no cards are provided or if all cards are present. 

In summary, due to the input reading issue and the incorrect handling of card presence checks, the program does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description.
