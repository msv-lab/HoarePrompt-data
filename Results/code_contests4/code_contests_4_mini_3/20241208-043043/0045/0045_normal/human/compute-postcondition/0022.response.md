According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. Since `i` is currently 1, it is less than 13, allowing the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 13**
