The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but will skip the remainder of the current iteration in a loop. Since the loop has completed its iterations and will not execute again, there are no further impacts on the state of the program.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None and has enough additional keys beyond 'D'; `i` is 13; the loop has completed its iterations and will not execute again.**
