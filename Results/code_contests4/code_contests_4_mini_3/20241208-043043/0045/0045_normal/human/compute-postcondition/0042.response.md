According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`, which contains 4 elements. The variable `i` is currently 25, indicating that this is the 26th iteration of the loop (as indexing starts from 0). The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than 4.

At the end of the last iteration with `i` equal to 25, the loop has already executed through all keys in the list. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 26. However, since there are only 4 keys in the list, there are no more keys left to iterate over. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 26; the loop cannot execute again because there are no more keys left to iterate over.**
