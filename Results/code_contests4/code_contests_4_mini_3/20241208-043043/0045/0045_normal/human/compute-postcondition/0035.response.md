Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None and has enough additional keys beyond 'D'; `i` is 13; the loop has completed its iterations and will not execute again. If `d[k][i]` is True, the state of the program reflects the condition that `d[k][i]` is satisfied. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state, as there is no else part to execute.***
