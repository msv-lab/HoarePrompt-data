The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we're directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None and has enough additional keys beyond 'D', `i` is 12, and `d[k][i]` is True, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
