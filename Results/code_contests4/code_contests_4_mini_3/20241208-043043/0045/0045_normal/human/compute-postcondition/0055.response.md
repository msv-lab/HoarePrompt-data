The code provided prints a formatted string containing the values of `k` and `i + 1`. Since `i` is 2, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 3. The output of the print statement will depend on the value of `k`, which is not specified in the initial state but is assumed to be a key in the dictionary `d` that is being iterated over. 

The program outputs the string formatted with `k` and `3`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 2; the output is the formatted string with current `k` and `3`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 2; output is the formatted string with current `k` and `3`.**
