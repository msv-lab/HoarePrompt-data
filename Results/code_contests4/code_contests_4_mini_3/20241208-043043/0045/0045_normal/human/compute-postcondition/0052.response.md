According to the code, the for loop will run as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To determine whether the loop can execute a second time, we need to check if `i` is less than 13. Since `i` is currently 1, it is less than 13, and the loop can indeed execute again.

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `i` will be 2. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` remains less than 13.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time; print outputs the formatted string '%s %d' % (k, 2)**
