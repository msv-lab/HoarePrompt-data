To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider what happens inside the loop based on the provided code and initial state. 

The loop iterates 13 times (for `i` from 0 to 12) for each key `k` in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing the print statement. Otherwise, it prints the values of `k` and `i + 1`.

After all iterations for all keys in `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` have executed:
- The variable `n` remains a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 52.
- The dictionary `d` still contains keys with values set to True or None.
- The variable `i` will be equal to 12 after the loop completes, as it increments from 0 to 12 during the loop execution.
- The output from the print statements will include the values of `k` and the corresponding `i + 1` for every `i` where `d[k][i]` is None.

Since the loop will check all values for each key and print accordingly, the final output state will capture the variable values after all iterations.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 12; the print statements have output values of `k` and `i + 1` for all indices where `d[k][i]` is None.**
