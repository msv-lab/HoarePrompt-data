According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. 

For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
