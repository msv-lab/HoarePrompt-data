Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= 52) and reads `n` cards from user input, where each card consists of a suit ('S', 'H', 'C', or 'D') and a rank (1 to 13). It then prints all combinations of suits and ranks that were not provided in the input, indicating which cards are missing. If no cards are provided (`n` is 0), it will print all 52 possible cards. **
