The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and the value of `d[k][i]` is True, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
