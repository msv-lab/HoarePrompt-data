The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since `i` is currently 14, which is not less than 13, the loop will not execute a second time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 14 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 14 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
