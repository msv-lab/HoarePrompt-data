The code prints a formatted string containing the value of `k` and the value of `i + 1`. The variables `n` and `d` are not affected by this line of code. The value of `i` is 12, so `i + 1` equals 13. The output will include the current value of `k` and the calculated value of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None and has enough additional keys beyond 'D', `i` is 12; printed output is '%s 13' with `k` being the value of `k`.**
