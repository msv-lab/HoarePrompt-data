Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time. If `d[k][i]` is True, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken in the absence of an else part.***
