The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer constrained such that \(0 \leq n \leq 52\). For each of the `n` cards, the function requires a suit represented by one of the characters 'S', 'H', 'C', or 'D' and a rank represented by an integer from 1 to 13. 

Since the output details are not provided, we cannot specify the return value. However, based on the provided constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (0 <= n <= 52) and for each of the `n` cards, it expects a suit ('S', 'H', 'C', or 'D') and a rank (1 to 13).**
