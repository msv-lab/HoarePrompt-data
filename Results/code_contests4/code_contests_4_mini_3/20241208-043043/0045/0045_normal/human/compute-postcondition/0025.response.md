The code prints a formatted string that includes the value of `k` and the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is currently 2, so `i + 1` will result in 3. The value of `k` is unknown, as it depends on the current state of the program and the loop's iteration. The states of the other variables (`n` and `d`) are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 2; and the output from the print statement is formatted as '%s %d' where %s will be replaced by the value of `k` and %d will be replaced by 3.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 2; output is formatted as '%s 3' where %s is the value of `k`.**
