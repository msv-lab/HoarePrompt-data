The code snippet prints a formatted string that includes the current value of `k` and the value of `i + 1`. The initial state mentions that `i` is 1, so `i + 1` will be 2. The variable `k` is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to have a value since it's being printed.

The output state reflects that while the values of `n`, `d`, and the looping condition are not directly affected by this print statement, the print operation itself will output the values of `k` and `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time; print outputs the formatted string '%s %d' % (k, 2)**.
