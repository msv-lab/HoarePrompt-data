According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which is currently 0. The loop will execute 13 times, starting from i = 0 and going up to i = 12. After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 1. The loop will execute again as long as `i` remains less than 13. 

Thus, to execute the loop a second time, `i` must be 1, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 13.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 13**
