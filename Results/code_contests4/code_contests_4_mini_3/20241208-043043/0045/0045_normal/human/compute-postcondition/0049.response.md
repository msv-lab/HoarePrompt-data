The execution of the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code within its body for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
