The values of `x` and `y` are assigned the values from the `raw_input()` function, which accepts user input and splits it into two variables. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `x` and `y` are assigned input values from the user.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are assigned input values from the user.**
