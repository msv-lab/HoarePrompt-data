The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
