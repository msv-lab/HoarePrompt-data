The code snippet provided executes a print statement, which formats and outputs the values of `k` and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is currently 14, so `i + 1` will be 15. The value of `k` depends on the current context of the loop, which is not specified here. However, since the code is within the loop and it has not been indicated that the loop is skipped, we will assume that the print statement executes.

The output state will include the current value of `k` and the computed value of `i + 1`, which is 15. Since we are not given any specific value for `k`, we will describe it generically.

Output State: **`k` is the current key, `i` is 14; printed output is '%s %d' % (k, 15)**
