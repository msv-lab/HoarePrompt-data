The value at the specified index of the multidimensional list `d` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The variables `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, except for `d[x][int(y) - 1]`, which is now set to `True`. The specific values of `x` and `y` are assumed to be valid indices for the list `d`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are assigned input values from the user, and `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is set to True.**
