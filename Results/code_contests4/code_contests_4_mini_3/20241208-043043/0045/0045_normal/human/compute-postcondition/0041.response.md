Given the provided code and the context of the loop execution, we can analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed.

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 12; for the loop to execute a fifth time, there must be additional keys available in the list beyond 'D'.

The loop iterates a fixed number of times (13) and checks the value associated with key `k` at index `i`. If the value is True, it skips to the next iteration. If not, it prints the formatted string with `k` and `i + 1`.

Considering all 13 iterations:

- If there are enough keys beyond 'D' and enough of them have values of None (or False), it is likely that some prints will occur.
- The maximum value of `i` at the end of the loop will be 12 (original value) + 13 (number of iterations) - 1 = 12 + 12 = 24 before it can become 25 in the print statement.

**Output State Analysis:**
- The variable `i` will be 12 + 13 = 25 after the loop ends.
- The printed output will include the last values printed based on the number of valid iterations.
- The exact output will depend on the contents of `d` and the number of keys that do not have the value True for the respective index.

Since we don't have specific values for `d`, we will summarize the output state in terms of its relationships.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 25; printed output reflects the keys `k` and their corresponding indices from 1 to 13 where the values were None.**
