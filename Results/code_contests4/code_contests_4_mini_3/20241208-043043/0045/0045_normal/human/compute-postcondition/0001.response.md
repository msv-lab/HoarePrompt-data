The variable `d` is assigned a dictionary containing four keys: 'S', 'H', 'C', and 'D'. Each key is associated with a list that has 13 elements, all initialized to `None`. The initial state of `n` as a non-negative integer does not affect the creation of this dictionary. Therefore, the output state is determined solely by the initialization of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `d` is {'S': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], 'H': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], 'C': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], 'D': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]}**
