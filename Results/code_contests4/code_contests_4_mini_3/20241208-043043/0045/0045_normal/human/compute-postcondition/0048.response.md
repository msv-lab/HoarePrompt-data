According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently 0, in the next iteration, `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the value of `i` needs to be 1. The loop will print a value formatted as '%s %d' with `k` and `i + 1`, which will be `k` and 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 52; `d` contains keys with values set to True or None; `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time; the value printed is formatted as '%s %d' with `k` and 2.**
