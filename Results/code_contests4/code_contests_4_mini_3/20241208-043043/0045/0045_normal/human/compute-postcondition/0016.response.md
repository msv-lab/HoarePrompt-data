Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None, and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If the value of `d[k][i]` is True, the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, there is no defined behavior in the else part.***
