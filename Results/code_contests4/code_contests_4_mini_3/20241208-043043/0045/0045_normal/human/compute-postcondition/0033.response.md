According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 13 times, as specified by the range in `for i in range(13)`. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each iteration, up to 12 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 12, which means the loop has executed 13 times, and it will not execute again since the next value of `i` would be 13, which is not less than 13.

To clarify, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would have to be less than 13. However, since `i` is already at 12 and the loop has completed its iterations without further conditions affecting it, the next value of `i` will be 13, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the key points to note are:
- The loop cannot execute again because it has already reached its maximum iteration count.
- The state variables do not need to change for the loop to execute again, as it will not.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None and has enough additional keys beyond 'D', `i` is 13; the loop has completed its iterations and will not execute again.**
