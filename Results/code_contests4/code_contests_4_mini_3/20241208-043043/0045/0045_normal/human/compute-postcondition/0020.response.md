Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None, and `i` is 1. If `d[k][i]` is True, the loop continues to the next iteration as `i` is less than 13. If `d[k][i]` is not True, the program does not change the state of `n`, `d`, or `i`.***
