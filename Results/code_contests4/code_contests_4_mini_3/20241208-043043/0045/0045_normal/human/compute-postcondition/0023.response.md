The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` contains keys with values set to True or None, `i` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop since `i` is less than 13.
