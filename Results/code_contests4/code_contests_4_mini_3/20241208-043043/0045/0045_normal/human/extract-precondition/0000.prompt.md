You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Taro is going to play a card game. However, now he has only n cards, even though there should be 52 cards (he has no Jokers).

The 52 cards include 13 ranks of each of the four suits: spade, heart, club and diamond.

Note

解説



Input

In the first line, the number of cards n (n ≤ 52) is given.

In the following n lines, data of the n cards are given. Each card is given by a pair of a character and an integer which represent its suit and rank respectively. A suit is represented by 'S', 'H', 'C' and 'D' for spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds respectively. A rank is represented by an integer from 1 to 13.

Output

Print the missing cards. The same as the input format, each card should be printed with a character and an integer separated by a space character in a line. Arrange the missing cards in the following priorities:

* Print cards of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds in this order.
* If the suits are equal, print cards with lower ranks first.
