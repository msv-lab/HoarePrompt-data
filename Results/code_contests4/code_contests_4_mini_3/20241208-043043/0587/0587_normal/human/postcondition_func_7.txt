The function accepts a list `l` containing two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of students using two-block and three-block pieces, respectively. It returns the list sorted in descending order, based solely on the values of `n` and `m`. The sorting is determined by a custom key function `getKey`, which is not defined in the provided code, so the specific sorting criteria cannot be evaluated. However, the function guarantees that the output is a sorted version of `l` in descending order, and it assumes `l` contains exactly two integers that meet the specified conditions.
