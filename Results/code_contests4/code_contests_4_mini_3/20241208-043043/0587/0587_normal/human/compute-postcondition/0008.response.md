The value of `at_start` is assigned as `False`, but it does not affect any other variables or states in the program. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `sep` is assigned from kwargs, `file` is assigned from kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`, and the value of `sep` is written to `file`; `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.
