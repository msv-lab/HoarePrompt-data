The `file.write` method is called with the value obtained from `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. This means it attempts to retrieve the value associated with the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary. If that key does not exist, it defaults to the string `'\n'`. The operation modifies the `kwargs` by removing the `'end'` key and its associated value if it exists.

Since `n` and `m` are non-negative integers and do not influence the operation of writing to the `file`, and `at_start` being `False` also does not impact this specific line of code, the main focus is on the effect of the `pop` operation.

The output state will reflect:
- The potential change in `kwargs` if the `'end'` key was present.
- The unchanged nature of `n`, `m`, and `at_start`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers; `file` has written the value of kwargs.pop('end', '\n') to it; `at_start` is False.**
