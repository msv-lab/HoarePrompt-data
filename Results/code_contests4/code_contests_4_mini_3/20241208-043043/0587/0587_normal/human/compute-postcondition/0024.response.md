The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, with the conditions that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). The function will produce a result based on these parameters, but since they are not directly passed to the function, we cannot specify the exact output without additional information on how `n` and `m` are obtained or utilized within the function. 

As per the provided output, we do not have specific case scenarios or return values outlined. Therefore, it is unclear what the function returns based solely on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates under the constraints that n and m are non-negative integers, satisfying the conditions 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
