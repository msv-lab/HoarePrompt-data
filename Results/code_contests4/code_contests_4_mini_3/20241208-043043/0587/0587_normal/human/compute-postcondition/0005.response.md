The line `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The variables `n`, `m`, `at_start`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is assigned from kwargs, `file` is assigned from kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `args`; the value of `sep` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is assigned from kwargs, `file` is assigned from kwargs, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `args`; the value of `sep` is written to `file`.**
