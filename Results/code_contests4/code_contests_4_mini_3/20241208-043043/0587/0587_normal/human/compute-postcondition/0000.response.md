The provided code snippet is a comment explaining the function of a print statement in Python, but it does not perform any action or change any variables. The values of `n` and `m` remain unaffected since no assignment or calculation is performed. Therefore, the output state is simply the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.**
