The `file.write(sep)` command writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The previous state indicates that `file` already contains the string representation of `x`, and `sep` is assigned from kwargs. The values of `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, but they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, after executing the code, the content of the `file` will now also include `sep` added to the existing string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers; `sep` is assigned from kwargs; `file` now contains the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`.**
