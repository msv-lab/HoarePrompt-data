Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and evaluates its primality. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is divisible by 2, 3, or any prime number greater than 3 up to the square root of `n`. It returns True if `n` is greater than 1 and is not divisible by any of these values, indicating that `n` is a prime number. **
