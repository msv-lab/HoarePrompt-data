Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, prints the string representations of elements from `args` to a specified file or to standard output by default, separates them with a specified separator, and optionally flushes the output. It requires certain keyword arguments to control its behavior, such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. It handles cases where the output needs to be formatted and flushed based on the presence of these keyword arguments. However, it does not return a value. **
