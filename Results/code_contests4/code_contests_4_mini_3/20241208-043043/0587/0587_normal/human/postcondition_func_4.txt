The function accepts no parameters and returns a list containing the result of `func_3()`. However, it relies on the external non-negative integers `n` and `m` being such that their sum is greater than 0. If the condition (n + m > 0) is not met, the function will still call `func_3()`, but the behavior of `func_3()` in that case is not defined within this context. Therefore, the function's behavior may be unpredictable if the precondition is not satisfied.
