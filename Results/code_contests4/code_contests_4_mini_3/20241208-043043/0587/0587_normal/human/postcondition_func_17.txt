The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters and does not have a defined return value. Instead, it redirects standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. There are no checks or validations for the existence of these files, which may lead to errors if the files do not exist or cannot be accessed.
