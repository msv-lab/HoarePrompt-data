The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` (representing the number of students using two-block pieces) and `y` (representing the number of students using three-block pieces), along with a positive integer `p`. It computes the result using modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y`, modulo `p`. The function returns the computed value `res`, which reflects the result of the operation when `y` reaches 0. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will return 1, consistent with the convention of any number raised to the power of 0 being 1.
