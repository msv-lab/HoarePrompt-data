The function accepts no parameters but reads a space-separated string of non-negative integers from user input. It returns a map object containing the string representations of these integers. The integers can range from 0 to 1,000,000, and the total number of integers read must be greater than 0. The function does not generate integers from 0 to n + m - 1, as indicated in the annotations; instead, it processes the input directly.
