The function initializes a new thread to execute the `main` function. It does not accept any parameters and relies on non-negative integers `n` and `m` that must be defined externally. The function does not return any value directly. It sets the recursion limit and stack size before starting the thread, ensuring that the system can handle deep recursion or extensive stack usage if necessary. However, since the actual implementation of `main` is not provided, the behavior and outcomes of this function depend on that undefined implementation. Additionally, there are no checks or validations performed within `func_6` itself regarding the values of `n` and `m`, nor does it handle any exceptions that may arise from starting a new thread.
