The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and a value `num`. It returns a 2D list (matrix) of size `n` x `m`, where each element is initialized to `num`. The function assumes that `n + m > 0`, ensuring that at least one of `n` or `m` is greater than zero. If both `n` and `m` are zero, the function does not explicitly handle this case but will return an empty list.
