The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `m` as input from the user, which must satisfy the conditions 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0. It returns a map object that contains the integer values of `n` and `m`. However, if the input does not meet the specified criteria (e.g., if the user inputs values that do not convert to integers or if both `n` and `m` are zero), the behavior of the function is not defined, as it does not handle such cases explicitly.
