The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and returns the result of the integer division of `x` by `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, it returns `x // y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns `(x // y) + 1`. The function assumes that `y` is greater than 0, as it does not handle the case where `y` is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. Therefore, the function may not behave correctly if `y` is zero.
