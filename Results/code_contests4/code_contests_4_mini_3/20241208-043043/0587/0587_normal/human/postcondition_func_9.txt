The function accepts a tuple `x` containing two non-negative integers (n and m) and returns True if `x` is non-zero and not a power of two; otherwise, it returns False. However, the code does not explicitly check if the tuple contains two non-negative integers, nor does it account for the scenario where `x` may represent an empty tuple or contain invalid values. Therefore, if `x` is an empty tuple, the function will return False, which may not align with the intended behavior described in the annotations.
