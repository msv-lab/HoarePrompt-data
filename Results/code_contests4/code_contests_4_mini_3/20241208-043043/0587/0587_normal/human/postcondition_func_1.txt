The function accepts no parameters and returns user input as a string. The input is expected to be a non-negative integer that satisfies the constraints of being within the range [0, 1,000,000] and ensuring that at least one of the inputs (n or m) is greater than zero. However, the function does not enforce these constraints, and it simply returns whatever input is provided by the user without validation.
