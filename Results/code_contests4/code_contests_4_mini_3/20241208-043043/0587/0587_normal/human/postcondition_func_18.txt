The function accepts no parameters and computes the first integer `i` in the range from 1 to 1,000,000 that satisfies the conditions based on the non-negative integers `n` and `m`, which are retrieved from another function `func_3()`. The conditions require that `n` is less than or equal to half of `i`, `m` is less than or equal to a third of `i`, and the sum `n + m` does not exceed the total of half of `i` and a third of `i` minus a sixth of `i`. If such an `i` is found, the function `func_20(i)` is called. If no such integer `i` exists, the loop will complete without executing `func_20(i)`, but there is no specified return value or behavior for that case.
