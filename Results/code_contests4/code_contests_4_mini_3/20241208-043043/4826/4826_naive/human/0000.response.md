To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to:

1. Calculate the minimum distance between pairs of cities based on their coordinates.
2. Determine how many such pairs exist with that minimum distance.

Let's look at the provided program:

```python
cities = int(sys.stdin.readline())
coordinates = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
coordinates.sort()
dist = 2 * 10 ** 9
count = 0
for (index, x) in enumerate(coordinates):
    if index < len(coordinates) - 1:
        temp_dist = coordinates[index + 1] - x
        if temp_dist < dist:
            dist = temp_dist
            count = 1
        elif temp_dist == dist:
            count += 1
print(str(dist) + ' ' + str(count))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Sorting**: The program sorts the coordinates. This is correct because the minimal distance between any two cities will always occur between two adjacent cities in a sorted list.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program computes the distance between adjacent cities:
   - `temp_dist = coordinates[index + 1] - x`
   - This correctly calculates the distance between the current city and the next city.

3. **Updating Minimum Distance and Count**:
   - The program initializes `dist` to a large value and updates it whenever it finds a smaller distance.
   - When it finds a distance equal to the minimum, it increments `count`.
   - This logic correctly counts the number of pairs with the minimum distance.

### Potential Edge Cases:
Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Minimum Input**: The smallest valid input where `n = 2`. 
   - Example: Input: `2\n1 3\n` 
   - Expected Output: `2 1`
   - The program should handle this correctly since it will compute the distance as `3 - 1 = 2` and count it as one pair.

- **Negative Coordinates**: Input with negative coordinates. 
   - Example: Input: `3\n-5 -2 -3\n`
   - Expected Output: `1 2` (Pairs: (-5, -2) and (-3, -2) both have a distance of 1)
   - The program sorts the coordinates and correctly identifies the minimum distance.

- **Large Range of Inputs**: Input where coordinates are far apart but with distinct values.
   - Example: Input: `4\n-1000000000 0 1000000000 999999999\n`
   - Expected Output: `1 1` (minimum distance is between `999999999` and `1000000000`)
   - The program should also handle this without issues.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program against the problem description and potential edge cases, it appears to handle all cases correctly. The logic for calculating the minimum distance and the count of pairs is accurately implemented.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly computes the minimal distance and the number of pairs with that distance for all valid input cases.
