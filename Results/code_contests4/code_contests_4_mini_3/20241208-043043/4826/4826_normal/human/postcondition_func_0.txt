The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and reads a list of `n` distinct integers representing coordinates. It calculates the minimum distance between consecutive coordinates after sorting them and counts how many times this minimum distance occurs. Finally, it prints the minimum distance and its count. The function does not return any value but instead outputs the results directly.
