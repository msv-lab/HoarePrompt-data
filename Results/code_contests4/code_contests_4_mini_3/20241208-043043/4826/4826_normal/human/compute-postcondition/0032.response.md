Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `coordinates` is a list of length at least `n`; `index` is 2; `x` is the third element in `coordinates`. If `index` is less than `len(coordinates) - 1`, then `temp_dist` is assigned the value of `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `count` is set to 1; if `temp_dist` equals `dist`, then `count` is increased by 1; if `temp_dist` is greater than `dist`, then `count` remains unchanged. If `index` is not less than `len(coordinates) - 1`, no changes are made to `count`, `temp_dist`, or any other variables.***
