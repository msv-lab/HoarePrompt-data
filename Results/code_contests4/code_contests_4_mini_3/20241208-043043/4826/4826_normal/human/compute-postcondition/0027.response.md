`dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`. The value of `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. Since `x` is the third element in `coordinates`, we can express `temp_dist` as `coordinates[3] - coordinates[2]`. Therefore, `dist` will hold the value of `coordinates[3] - coordinates[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `coordinates` is a list of length at least `n`; `index` is 2; `x` is the third element in `coordinates`; `dist` is assigned the value of `coordinates[3] - coordinates[2]**
