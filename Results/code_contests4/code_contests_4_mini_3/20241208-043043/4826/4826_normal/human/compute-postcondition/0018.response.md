The value of `temp_dist` is assigned the result of `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. The value of `index` is 1, so `index + 1` is 2. Therefore, `temp_dist` will be calculated as `coordinates[2] - x`, where `x` is the second element in `coordinates`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `coordinates` is a list of length at least `n`; `index` is 1; `x` is the second element in `coordinates`; `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[2] - x`.**
