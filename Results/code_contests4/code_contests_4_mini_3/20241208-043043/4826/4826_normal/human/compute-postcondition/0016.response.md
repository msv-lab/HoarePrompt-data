Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `coordinates` is a list of length at least `n`; `index` is 0; `x` is the first element in `coordinates`. If `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, then `temp_dist` is calculated as the difference between the second element of `coordinates` and `x`. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, `dist` is updated to `temp_dist` and `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` is greater than or equal to `dist`, and if `temp_dist` equals `dist`, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `index` is equal to or greater than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, no changes are made to `dist` or `count`.***
