Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `coordinates` is a list of length at least `n`; `index` is 1; `x` is the second element in `coordinates`. If `index` is less than `len(coordinates) - 1`, `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[2] - x`, and `dist` is calculated as `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]`. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` equals `dist`, `count` is increased by 1; if `temp_dist` is greater than `dist`, `count` remains unchanged. If `index` is not less than `len(coordinates) - 1`, no changes are made to `count`.***
