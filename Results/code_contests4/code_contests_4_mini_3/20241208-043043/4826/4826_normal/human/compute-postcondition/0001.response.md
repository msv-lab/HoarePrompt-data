The variable `coordinates` is assigned the value of `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`, which takes a line of input, splits it into separate values, converts each of those values to an integer, and creates a map object that can be iterated over. The previous state of the variables does not change, but now we have a new variable `coordinates` that will contain integers corresponding to the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `cities` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`; `coordinates` is a map object of integers from input.**
