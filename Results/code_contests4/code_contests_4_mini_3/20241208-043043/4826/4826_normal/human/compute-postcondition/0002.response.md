The `coordinates` is a map object of integers from input. The `sort()` method is called on `coordinates`, which will sort the integers in ascending order. The sorting operation affects the order of the elements in `coordinates` but does not change the number of elements or their values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `cities` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`; `coordinates` is sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `cities` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`; `coordinates` is sorted in ascending order.**
