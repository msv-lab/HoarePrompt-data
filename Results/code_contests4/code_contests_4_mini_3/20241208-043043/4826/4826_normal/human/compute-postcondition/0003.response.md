The variable `dist` is assigned the value `2 * 10 ** 9`, which calculates to `2000000000`. The other variables `n` and `cities` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `cities` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`; `coordinates` is sorted in ascending order; `dist` is 2000000000.
