`dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`. The previous value of `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[2] - x`, where `x` is the second element in `coordinates`. Therefore, `dist` will hold the value of `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `coordinates` is a list of length at least `n`; `index` is 1; `x` is the second element in `coordinates`; `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[2] - x`; `dist` is calculated as `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]`.
