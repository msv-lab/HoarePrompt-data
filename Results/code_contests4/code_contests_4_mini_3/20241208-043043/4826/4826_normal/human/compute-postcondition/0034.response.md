The code snippet prints the values of `dist` and `count` as strings, concatenated with a space in between. The variables `dist` and `count` are not modified by this operation, and their values remain the same as in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `dist` and `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `coordinates` is a list of length at least `n`; `dist` is the minimum distance between consecutive elements in `coordinates`; `count` is the number of times `dist` occurs among the distances between consecutive elements in `coordinates`; printed output is 'dist count'.**
