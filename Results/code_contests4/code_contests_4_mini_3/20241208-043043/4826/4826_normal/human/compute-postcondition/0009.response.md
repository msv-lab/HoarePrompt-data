Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `coordinates` is a list of length at least `n`; `index` is 0; `x` is the first element in `coordinates`; `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1; `temp_dist` is the difference between the second element of `coordinates` and `x`; `temp_dist` is less than `dist`; `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`.**
