The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer `ai` satisfies the constraint -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9. 

The functionality of the function is not provided in detail, but it can be inferred that it processes the list of distinct integers based on the value of `n`. However, the output or return value of the function is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list a of n distinct integers (where -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9). The specific return value of the function is not defined.**
