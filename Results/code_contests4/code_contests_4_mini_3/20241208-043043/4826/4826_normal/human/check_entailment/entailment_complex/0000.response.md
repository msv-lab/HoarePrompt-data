Correctness: **True**

The provided program implements the requirements outlined in the problem description effectively. Here's an explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the integer `n` (the number of cities) and then it reads a list of `n` distinct integers representing the coordinates of the cities. This matches the input specifications given in the problem description.

2. **Sorting Coordinates**: The program sorts the list of coordinates. Sorting is necessary because the minimal distance between two cities will always occur between consecutive cities in a sorted list. This is an efficient way to ensure that we only need to check the distances between neighboring coordinates.

3. **Distance Calculation**: After sorting, the program initializes a variable `dist` to a very large value (2 * 10^9) to ensure that any actual distance found will be smaller. It then iterates through the sorted coordinates and calculates the distance between each pair of consecutive cities. 

4. **Counting Minimal Distances**: The program keeps track of the smallest distance found (`dist`) and counts how many times this smallest distance occurs (`count`). If it finds a new smaller distance, it resets the count to 1. If it finds another pair with the same minimum distance, it increments the count. This logic correctly implements the requirement to find both the minimum distance and the number of pairs that have this distance.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the minimum distance and the count of pairs, adhering to the output specifications.

The algorithm operates efficiently within the provided constraints. Sorting takes O(n log n) time, and the single pass through the list to count distances takes O(n) time, making it suitable for the input size limits.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description, ensuring correctness in its implementation.
