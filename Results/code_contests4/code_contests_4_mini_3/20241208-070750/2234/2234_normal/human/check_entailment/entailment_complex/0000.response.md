Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Substring Check Logic**: The program checks how many times each string appears as a substring in the others, but it does not ensure that all preceding strings are substrings of the current string in the sorted order. The substring check is insufficient because it only counts occurrences rather than checking the necessary ordering condition.

2. **Handling of Multiple Unique Strings**: The program checks if more than one string appears exactly once. If this condition is met, it outputs "NO". However, the problem description does not specify that having multiple unique substrings is a reason to output "NO". The requirement is to ensure that all strings that precede each string in the final order are substrings of that string.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic is based on the count of how many strings contain a given string rather than ensuring that a string can indeed contain all previously listed strings as substrings. The approach does not guarantee that the final arrangement satisfies the requirement that each string in the output order must be able to include all preceding strings as substrings.

4. **Lack of Output for Invalid Cases**: If the strings cannot be arranged as required, the program does not provide a valid mechanism to check or output "NO" based on the conditions outlined in the problem description.

In summary, the program fails to guarantee that the strings can be ordered such that each string is a substring of the following strings, which is the core requirement of the problem description. Thus, it does not meet the requirements specified, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
