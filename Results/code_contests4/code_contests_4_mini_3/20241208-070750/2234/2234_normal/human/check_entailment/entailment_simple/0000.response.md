The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The program counts how many times each string is found as a substring in other strings, but it does not ensure that each string can be a substring of all subsequent strings in the sorted order. It only counts occurrences instead of checking if the required substring condition is met for every string.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**:
   - The program sorts the strings based on the counts of their occurrences as substrings, which does not guarantee that the sorted order will have the property that every string is a substring of all the strings that follow it in the order. The problem requires a specific ordering based on substring relationships, which is not achieved through the current logic.

3. **Final Output Logic**:
   - The check for `c2 > 1` to print "NO" is based on how many unique strings have exactly one occurrence as a substring, which does not logically correlate to the required substring condition across all strings in the list. This could lead to incorrect conclusions about whether a valid ordering exists.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
3
a
ab
b
```
The program might incorrectly process this input and produce a result that suggests an ordering exists when, in fact, the strings cannot be reordered to satisfy the substring condition.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not fulfill the requirement of checking that all preceding strings are substrings of the following strings in a valid order, it does not adhere to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
