The value of `count` is incremented by 1, increasing its previous value of 1 to 2. The other variables `t`, `ls`, `x`, `dict1`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the second character of `ls`, `count` is 2, `dict1` has a key `x` with the value 0, `z` is the second character of `ls`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the second character of `ls`, `count` is 2, `dict1` has a key `x` with the value 0, `z` is the second character of `ls`**
