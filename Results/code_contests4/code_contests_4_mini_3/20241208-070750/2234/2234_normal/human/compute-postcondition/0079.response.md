According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c1`. The loop will only execute if `c1` is greater than 0. Since `c1` is currently 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `c1` needs to be greater than 0. The variable `z` will also be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0 when `c1` is 1. 

State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `c1` is greater than 0 and `z` is 0**
