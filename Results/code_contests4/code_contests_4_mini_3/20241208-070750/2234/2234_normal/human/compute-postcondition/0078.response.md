`c1` is assigned the value of `ls.count(x[0])`, which counts how many times the first item of `x` (which is the first item of `sorted_x`) appears in the string `ls`. Since `ls` is an empty string, `ls.count(x[0])` will return 0, regardless of the value of `x[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, and `c1` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 0**
