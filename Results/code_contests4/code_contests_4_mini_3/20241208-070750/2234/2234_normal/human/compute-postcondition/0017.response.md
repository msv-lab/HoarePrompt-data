The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `ls`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the first character of `ls`, and `count` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the first character of `ls`, and `count` is 0**
