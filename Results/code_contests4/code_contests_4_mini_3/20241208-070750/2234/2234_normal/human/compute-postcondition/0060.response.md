The `sorted_x` list is reversed, but since it is initially an empty list, reversing it does not change its state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `sorted_x` is still an empty list after reversal.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `sorted_x` is still an empty list**
