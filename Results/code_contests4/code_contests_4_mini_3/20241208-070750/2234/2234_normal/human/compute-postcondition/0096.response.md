The code assigns the value of `ls.count(x[0])` to `c1`. Since `ls` is an empty string, the count of any element (including `x[0]`) in `ls` will be 0. Therefore, `c1` will be assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `sorted_x` must contain at least 1 element.**
