The code attempts to print `x[0]`, but the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, an error occurs due to the undefined variable. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as a result of this code execution.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 2, `z` is 3, and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `x`.**
