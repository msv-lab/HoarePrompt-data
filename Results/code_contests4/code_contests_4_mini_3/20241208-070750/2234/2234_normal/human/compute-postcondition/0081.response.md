According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `c1`. If `c1` is greater than `z`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0 and `c1` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `z` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `c1` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 1, `z` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `c1` must be greater than 1**
