According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must have been at least 1 before it was decreased, meaning it must currently be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ls` is a list containing the string `a`; `a` is an input string from raw_input(); for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 0**
