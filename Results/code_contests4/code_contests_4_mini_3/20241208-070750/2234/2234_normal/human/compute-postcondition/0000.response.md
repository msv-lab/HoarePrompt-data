The variable `t` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` will depend on the input provided, but it is expected to be a positive integer. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an input integer**
