According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `c1` must be greater than 0. Since `c1` is currently 0, it is necessary to adjust it. The other variables (`t`, `ls`, and `dict1`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly but can be stated as they are. 

To ensure the loop will execute, `c1` needs to be greater than 0. Thus, we can set `c1` to 1 for the loop to run at least once. The variable `z` would start at 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `z` is 0**
