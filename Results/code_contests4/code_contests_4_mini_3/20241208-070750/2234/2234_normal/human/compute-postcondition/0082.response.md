The code attempts to print the first element of `x`, but `x` is not defined in the given initial state. The values of `t`, `ls`, `dict1`, `c1`, and `z` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 1, `z` is 1, and an attempt to print an undefined variable `x` occurs.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 1, `z` is 1, and an attempt to print an undefined variable `x` occurs.**
