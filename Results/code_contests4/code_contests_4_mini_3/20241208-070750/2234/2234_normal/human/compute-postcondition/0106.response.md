The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \). The function also processes `n` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having lengths ranging from 1 to 100, inclusive. However, the specific output of the function is not provided. Therefore, I cannot describe the return value or the nature of the output based on the information given. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and processes n strings consisting of lowercase English letters, but the specific output is not defined.**
