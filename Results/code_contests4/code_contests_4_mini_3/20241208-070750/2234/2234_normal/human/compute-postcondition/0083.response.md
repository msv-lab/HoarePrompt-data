According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `c1`. The loop will execute as long as `z` is less than `c1`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 1, and `c1` is also 1, indicating that the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute a second time, `c1` must be greater than 1.

Since the `for` loop iterates over a range defined by `c1`, and `z` will be incremented after each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `c1` must be greater than 1, and `z` will be 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` must be greater than 1, `z` is 1**
