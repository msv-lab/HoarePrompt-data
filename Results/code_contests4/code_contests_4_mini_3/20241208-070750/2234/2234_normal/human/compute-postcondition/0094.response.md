The loop will not execute because `c1` is initialized to 0, which means the range for `z` will be empty. Therefore, no iterations will occur. The values of `t`, `ls`, `dict1`, and `c1` will remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 0.**
