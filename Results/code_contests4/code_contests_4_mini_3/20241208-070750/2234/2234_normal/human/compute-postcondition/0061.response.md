The variable `c2` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `ls`, `dict1`, or `sorted_x`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `sorted_x` is still an empty list, and `c2` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `sorted_x` is still an empty list, `c2` is 0**
