The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the first character of `ls`, `z` is the second character of `ls`, and `count` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the first character of `ls`, `z` is the second character of `ls`, and `count` is 2**
