`ls` is a list that initially contains the string `a` twice. The code `ls.append(a)` adds another instance of `a` to the list `ls`. Therefore, after execution, `ls` will contain the string `a` three times. The variable `n` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ls` contains the string `a` three times; `a` is an input string from raw_input()**
