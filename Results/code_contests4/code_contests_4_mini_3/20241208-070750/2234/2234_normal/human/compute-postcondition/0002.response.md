According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. Since we want the loop to execute for the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `ls` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time then `t` must be greater than 0**
