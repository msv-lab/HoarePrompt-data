The list `ls` is modified by appending the value of `a` to it. The initial state specifies that `ls` contains the string `a`, so after the execution of the code, `ls` will contain two elements: the original string `a` and the new instance of `a` being appended. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ls` contains the string `a` twice; `a` is an input string from raw_input().

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ls` contains the string `a` twice; `a` is an input string from raw_input()**.
