The code appends the input string `a` to the list `ls`. Since `ls` is initially an empty list, after execution, `ls` will contain the string `a`. The values of `n` and `a` are not altered, so the output state reflects the updated state of `ls`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ls` is a list containing the string `a`; `a` is an input string from raw_input()**
