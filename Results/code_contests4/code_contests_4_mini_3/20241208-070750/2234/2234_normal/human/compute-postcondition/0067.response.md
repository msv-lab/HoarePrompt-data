The variable `c2` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `c2`, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The other variables `t`, `ls`, and `dict1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, and `c2` is increased by 1 but its previous value is unknown.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, and `c2` is increased by 1 but its previous value is unknown.**
