The value of `c1` is assigned the result of `ls.count(x[0])`. Since `ls` is an empty string, `ls.count(x[0])` will always return 0 regardless of what `x[0]` is. Therefore, after execution, `c1` will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 0**
