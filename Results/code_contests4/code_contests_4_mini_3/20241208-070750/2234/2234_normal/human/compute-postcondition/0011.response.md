The variable `a` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which is an input string provided by the user. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed; `n` remains an integer within the specified range, and `ls` continues to contain the string `a` twice. The variable `t` is also unaffected in this context. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ls` contains the string `a` twice; `a` is an input string from raw_input()**
