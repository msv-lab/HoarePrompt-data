According to the code, the loop iterates over `sorted_x`. Since the loop does not execute in the previous iteration, it indicates that `sorted_x` is empty. For the loop to execute at least once, `sorted_x` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, and `c1` is 0. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `sorted_x` must contain at least one element.

State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 0, for the loop to execute at least once `sorted_x` must contain at least 1 element.**
