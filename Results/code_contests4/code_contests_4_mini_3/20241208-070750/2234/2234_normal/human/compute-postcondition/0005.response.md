The variable `t` is decremented by 1, but the value of `t` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `t`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ls` is a list containing the string `a`; `a` is an input string from raw_input(); `t` is decreased by 1.**
