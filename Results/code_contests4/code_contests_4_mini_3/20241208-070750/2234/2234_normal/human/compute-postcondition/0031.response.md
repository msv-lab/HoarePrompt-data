The value of `count` is assigned to 0, which resets the previous value of `count` (the number of occurrences of `x` in `ls`). This means that the previous value of `count` is lost, and it is now 0. Other variables (`t`, `ls`, `x`, and `dict1`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the second character of `ls`, `count` is 0, `dict1` has a key `x` with the value 0**
