The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the third character of `ls`, `count` is 2, `dict1` has a key `x` with the value of 0, `z` is the second character of `ls`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `ls` is a non-empty string, `x` is the third character of `ls`, `count` is 2, `dict1` has a key `x` with the value of 0, `z` is the second character of `ls`**
