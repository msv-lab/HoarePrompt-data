According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sorted_x`. If `sorted_x` has at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, and `c1` is 0. Since `sorted_x` is being iterated over, if it is empty, the loop cannot execute any further. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `sorted_x` must contain at least one element. When the loop executes, `x` will take the first element in `sorted_x`, and we can assume that the iteration variable `c1` would increase by 1, leading it to 1.

State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `c1` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `sorted_x` must contain at least 1 element.**
