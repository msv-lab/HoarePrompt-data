The code initializes `dict1` as an empty dictionary. The previous value of `t` is 0, and `ls` contains the string `a` repeated 0 times, which results in an empty string. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, and `dict1` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary**
