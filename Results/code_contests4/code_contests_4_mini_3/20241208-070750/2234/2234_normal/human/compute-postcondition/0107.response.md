Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of strings to process (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and then reads `t` strings of lowercase English letters. It counts how many times each string appears in the input. If more than one string appears exactly once, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the strings that appeared in the input according to their counts. The output includes the strings that appear more than once as many times as they appear. If no strings are provided (e.g., if `t` is 0), the function does not handle this case and may produce an error.**
