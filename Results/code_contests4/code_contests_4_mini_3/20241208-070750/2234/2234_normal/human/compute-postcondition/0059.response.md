The code sorts the items of `dict1` based on the values (the second item of each key-value pair) using the `sorted` function along with `operator.itemgetter(1)`. Since `dict1` is currently an empty dictionary, `dict1.items()` returns an empty view, and thus `sorted_x` will be assigned an empty list. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` is an empty string, `dict1` is an empty dictionary, `sorted_x` is an empty list.**
