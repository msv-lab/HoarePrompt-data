Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to reorder the strings such that each string that appears before another is a substring of that string. 

Hereâ€™s a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
abc
a
b
ab
```

According to the problem description, the expected output should be:
```
YES
a
b
ab
abc
```
In this case:
- "a" is a substring of "ab"
- "b" is a substring of "ab"
- "ab" is a substring of "abc"

However, the program checks the number of occurrences of each string as a substring in other strings rather than ensuring that each string is indeed a substring of the next one in the sorted order. 

Additionally, it incorrectly counts the occurrences and uses that count to decide if it should print "NO". This logic is flawed because the presence of a string as a substring does not guarantee the required ordering.

Thus, the program's approach does not guarantee the correct ordering of the strings based on the substring condition as described in the problem. Hence, it is incorrect.
