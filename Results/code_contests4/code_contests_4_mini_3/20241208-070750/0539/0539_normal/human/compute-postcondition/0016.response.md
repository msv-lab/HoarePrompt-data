According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 2 and will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n` after being incremented.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, to execute the loop a third time, `i` will be incremented to 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`).

State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `A` is a list containing the tuples `(2)` and `(2, 2)`; `s` is increased by 2; `i` is 3; for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3**
