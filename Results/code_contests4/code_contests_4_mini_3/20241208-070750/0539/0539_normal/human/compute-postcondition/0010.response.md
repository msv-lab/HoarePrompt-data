According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and runs while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least `2` (since `i` will be incremented by 1). 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to `2`.

State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is at least 2; `A` is a list containing the tuple `(2`, `s` is increased by the first element of the last tuple in `A`, `i` is 2**
