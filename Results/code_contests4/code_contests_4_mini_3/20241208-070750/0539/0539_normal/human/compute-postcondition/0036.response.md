The value of `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`. Since `target` is less than or equal to 0, the new value of `target` will be less than or equal to the previous value minus `tup[0]`. The variables `sum`, `limit`, and `n` remain unchanged, as well as the list `A`, which still contains `n` tuples, and `selected`, which contains elements derived from `A`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is an integer (increased by 1, as A must contain one more tuple), `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `target` is less than or equal to the previous value minus `tup[0]`, and `selected` is a list containing `tup[1]`.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is an integer (increased by 1), `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `target` is less than or equal to the previous value minus `tup[0]`, `selected` is a list containing `tup[1]**
