The code `A.append((2 ** k, i))` adds a new tuple to the list `A`. The tuple consists of two values: `2 ** k` and `i`. Given that `k` is 1 and `i` is 3, we can calculate `2 ** k` which is `2 ** 1 = 2`. Therefore, the tuple that is appended to `A` is `(2, 3)`.

The other variables `sum`, `limit`, `target`, `s`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `A` originally contains the tuples (2) and (2, 2), and after the execution of the code, it will also include the newly appended tuple.

Thus, the output state reflects the new contents of `A` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `A` is a list containing the tuples (2), (2, 2), and (2, 3); `s` is increased by 2; `i` is 3; `k` is 1**
