Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `target` and `n` as input, where `target` is the desired sum and `n` represents the number of possible integer values to consider. It calculates a list of tuples containing powers of 2 and their corresponding indices, checks if the total of these powers is less than `target`, and if so, it prints -1. If sufficient powers are available, it selects the indices of the tuples that sum to at least `target`, and prints the count of selected indices followed by the indices themselves. If no indices are selected, it outputs 0 and an empty line. **
