The code appends a new tuple to the list `A`. The first element of the tuple is calculated as `2 ** k`, where `k` is 1. Therefore, `2 ** k` equals `2 ** 1`, which is 2. The second element of the tuple is `i`, which is 2. Thus, the tuple `(2, 2)` is created. The previous state of the list `A` contains at least one tuple `(2)`, and after appending, it will contain `(2)` and `(2, 2)`.

The output state reflects the updated contents of the list `A`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is at least 2; `A` is a list containing the tuples `(2)` and `(2, 2)`; `s` is increased by the first element of the last tuple in `A`; `i` is 2; `k` is 1.**
