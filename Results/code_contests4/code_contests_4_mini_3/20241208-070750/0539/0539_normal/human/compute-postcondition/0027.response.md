Since `A` is a list containing `n` tuples, the execution of `A.sort()` will sort the list `A` in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple. The values of `sum`, `limit`, `target`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, after running the code, the output state reflects the sorted list `A`.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit` are integers, `target` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples**
