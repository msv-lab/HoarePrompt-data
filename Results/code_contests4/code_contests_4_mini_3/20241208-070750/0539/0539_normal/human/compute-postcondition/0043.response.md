The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `tup` is the first tuple in the list `A`, `target` is decreased by the first element of `tup`, and `tup[1]` is appended to `selected` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
