Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `n` are integers, `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `tup` is the first tuple in the list `A`, `target` is decreased by the first element of `tup`, and `tup[1]` is appended to `selected`. If `target` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
