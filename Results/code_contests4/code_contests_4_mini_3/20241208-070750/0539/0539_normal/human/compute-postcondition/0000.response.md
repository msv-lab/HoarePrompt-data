The variables `target` and `n` are assigned values based on the input provided through `raw_input()`. The function `map(int, ...)` converts the input strings into integers. The values of `sum` and `limit` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `target` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `target` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer**.
