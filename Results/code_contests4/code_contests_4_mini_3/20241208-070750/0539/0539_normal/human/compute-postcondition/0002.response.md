The variable `s` is initialized to 0. The values of `sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, and `A` remain unchanged as the code only affects `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `target` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `A` is an empty list, and `s` is 0.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `target` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `A` is an empty list, and `s` is 0**
