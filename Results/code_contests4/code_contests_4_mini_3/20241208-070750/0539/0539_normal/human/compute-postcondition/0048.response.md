The function `func` accepts two parameters: `sum` and `limit`. Both `sum` and `limit` are integers, and they are constrained such that \(1 \leq sum, limit \leq 100000\). The function's output is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific return values or conditions based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two integers, `sum` and `limit`, both within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `sum` and `limit`, both of which are integers constrained between 1 and 100000.**
