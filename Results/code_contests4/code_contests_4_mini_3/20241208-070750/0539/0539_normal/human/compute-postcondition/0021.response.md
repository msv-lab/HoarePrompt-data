The variable `s` is increased by the first element of the last tuple in the list `A`. The last tuple in `A` is (2, 3), and the first element of this tuple is 2. Therefore, `s` will be increased by 2. The previous value of `s` was increased by 2, but since the initial value of `s` is not given, we can only state that it has been incremented. The values of `sum`, `limit`, `target`, `i`, and `k` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `A` is a list containing the tuples (2), (2, 2), and (2, 3); `s` is increased by 2; `i` is 3; `k` is 1; `s` is increased by 2 from its previous value.**
