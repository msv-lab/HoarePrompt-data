The code prints the elements of the `selected` list as a string, with each element converted to a string and joined by spaces. Since the length of `selected` is already known and printed, we assume `selected` contains a certain number of elements (which could be zero or more). However, the specific elements or count are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `selected` is being printed.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, and `n` are integers; `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples; `target` is less than or equal to 0; length of `selected` is printed.**
