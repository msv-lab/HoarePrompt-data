Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `A` is a list containing the tuples (2) and (2, 2); if `i` is not equal to 1 and `k` equals `i - 1`, then `s` is increased by 2, `i` is 3, and `k` is 1; otherwise, there is no change in the values of `sum`, `limit`, `target`, `A`, `s`, `i`, and `k`.***
