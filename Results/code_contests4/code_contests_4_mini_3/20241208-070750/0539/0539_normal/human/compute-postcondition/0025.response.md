The code `exit()` terminates the execution of the program immediately. Therefore, no changes are made to the values of the variables, and the program stops running. The output state reflects the current values of the variables before the termination. 

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `target` is an input integer, `n` is the input integer, `A` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (2, ...), and -1 is printed**.
