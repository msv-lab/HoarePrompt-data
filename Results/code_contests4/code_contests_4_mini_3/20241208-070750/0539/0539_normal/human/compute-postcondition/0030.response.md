The variable `target` is decremented by the first element of the tuple `tup`. The initial value of `tup` is the first tuple in the sorted list `A`, and since `A` has at least one tuple, `tup[0]` is a specific integer. The values of `sum`, `limit`, `n`, `A`, and `selected` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `target` is decremented by `tup[0]`, `n` is an integer, `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `selected` is an empty list, `tup` is the first tuple in A.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `target` is decremented by `tup[0]`, `n` is an integer, `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `selected` is an empty list, `tup` is the first tuple in A**
