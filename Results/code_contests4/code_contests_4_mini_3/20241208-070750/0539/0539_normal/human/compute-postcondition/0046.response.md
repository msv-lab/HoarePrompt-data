The `print(len(selected))` statement outputs the length of the list `selected`. Since `selected` contains the `tup[1]` values from `A` up to the point where `target` was decremented to less than or equal to 0, the length of `selected` will represent the number of tuples processed before `target` reached that condition. 

If no tuples were processed, `selected` is empty, resulting in a length of 0. Therefore, the output state reflects the integer value representing the length of `selected`.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, and `n` are integers; `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples; `target` is less than or equal to 0; and the length of `selected` is printed.**
