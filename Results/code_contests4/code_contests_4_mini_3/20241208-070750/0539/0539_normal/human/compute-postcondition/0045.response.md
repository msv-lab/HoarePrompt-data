To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided initial state and the code. 

In the loop, we iterate over each tuple `tup` in the sorted list `A`. During each iteration, we decrement `target` by the first element of the tuple `tup[0]` and append the second element `tup[1]` to the `selected` list. The loop continues until `target` becomes less than or equal to 0, at which point we break out of the loop.

- If `target` is initially greater than the sum of all `tup[0]` values in `A`, the loop will execute for all tuples in `A`, decrementing `target` accordingly and appending all `tup[1]` values to `selected`.
- If `target` is less than or equal to 0 at the start, the loop will not execute at all, and `selected` will remain an empty list.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- If the loop executes completely (meaning `target` became less than or equal to 0 during the iterations), `selected` will contain all `tup[1]` from `A`, and `target` will be less than or equal to 0.
- If the loop does not execute (meaning `target` was initially less than or equal to 0), `selected` remains empty.

Considering these points, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, and `n` are integers; `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples; `target` is less than or equal to 0; `selected` is a list containing the `tup[1]` values from `A` up to the point where `target` was decremented to less than or equal to 0; if no tuples were processed, `selected` is empty.**
