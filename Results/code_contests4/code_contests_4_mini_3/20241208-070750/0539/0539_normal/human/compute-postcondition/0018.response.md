`k` is assigned the value of `int(math.log(i, 2))`. Given that `i` is 3, we can calculate `math.log(3, 2)`, which is approximately 1.58496. Converting this to an integer using `int()` will truncate the decimal part, resulting in `k` being assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables (`sum`, `limit`, `target`, `A`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `A` is a list containing the tuples (2) and (2, 2); `s` is increased by 2; `i` is 3; `k` is 1.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `target` is an integer; `A` is a list containing the tuples (2) and (2, 2); `s` is increased by 2; `i` is 3; `k` is 1**
