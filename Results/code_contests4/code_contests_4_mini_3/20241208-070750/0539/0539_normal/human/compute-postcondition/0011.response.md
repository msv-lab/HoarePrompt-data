The value of `k` is assigned the expression `(i & -i) - 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so we first calculate `i & -i`. In binary, 2 is represented as `10`, and -2 (two's complement) is `...11111110` (infinite leading 1s followed by `10`). Thus, `i & -i` results in `2`. Subtracting 1 from this gives us `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is at least 2; `A` is a list containing the tuple `(2`, `s` is increased by the first element of the last tuple in `A`; `i` is 2; `k` is 1.
