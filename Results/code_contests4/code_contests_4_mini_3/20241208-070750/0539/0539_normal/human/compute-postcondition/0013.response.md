Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is at least 2; `A` is a list containing the tuple `(2`; `s` is increased by the first element of the last tuple in `A`; `i` is 2; `k` is 1. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `k` is equal to `i - 1`, then `k` is assigned the value 1 since `math.log(2, 2)` equals 1.***
