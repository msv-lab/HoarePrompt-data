Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, and `n` are integers; `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples; `target` has been decremented by `tup[0]` and is less than or equal to 0; `selected` is a list containing `tup[1]`. If `target` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
