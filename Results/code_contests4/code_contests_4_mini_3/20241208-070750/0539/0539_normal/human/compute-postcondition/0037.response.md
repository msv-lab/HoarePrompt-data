In this code snippet, the `selected` list is modified by appending the value `tup[1]` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed in this operation; only the `selected` list is updated.

The output state will reflect that `tup[1]` has been added to the `selected` list. The other variables (`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `A`, `target`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is an integer (increased by 1), `A` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `target` is less than or equal to the previous value minus `tup[0]`, `selected` now contains `tup[1]` appended.**
