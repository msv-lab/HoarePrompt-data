To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we will analyze the intended behavior of the program and verify if it meets the requirements specified.

**Problem Analysis:**
1. We need a set of distinct integers from 1 to `limit`.
2. The sum of the lowbit values of these integers must equal `sum`.
3. The lowbit of an integer `x` is defined as the value of the lowest power of 2 that divides `x`.

**Program Analysis:**
The program processes the input values and attempts to create a list `A` with tuples of `(lowbit value, integer)`. It then checks if the sum of the lowbit values can meet the `target` (which corresponds to `sum` in the problem description).

**Key Observations:**
1. The calculation of lowbit seems to be implemented incorrectly. The expression `(i & -i) - 1` does not accurately compute the lowbit.
2. The check for `s < target` may not be sufficient to determine if it is impossible to find a valid set; it doesn't account for cases where the potential lowbit sums might be more than `target` but cannot be formed with distinct integers.

**Potential Cases:**
1. If `sum = 1` and `limit = 1`: The program should return `1` and `1`, but it might not handle this correctly due to the logic for selecting integers.
2. If `sum = 5` and `limit = 1`: The program should return `-1`, and it might handle this correctly, but due to the sorting and selection logic, it could potentially miss valid combinations.
3. The logic for creating and selecting from `A` may not ensure the numbers are distinct and within the required limit, which could lead to invalid outputs.

**Conclusion:**
The program's logic appears to be flawed in the way it computes lowbits and does not effectively ensure the constraints of the problem are met regarding distinct integers and their values in the required range.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find a valid set according to the problem description due to the incorrect computation of lowbit values and potential oversight in validating distinct integers within the limit.
