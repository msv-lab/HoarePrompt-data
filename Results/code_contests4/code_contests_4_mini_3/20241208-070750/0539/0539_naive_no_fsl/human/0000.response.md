To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the program and potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `target` (sum) and `n` (limit), which conform to the constraints provided in the problem description.
  
2. **Generating Lowbits**:
   - The program attempts to create a list `A` where each entry is a tuple of the form `(lowbit(i), i)`.
   - The calculation of `lowbit(i)` is done using the expression `(i & -i) - 1`, which does not yield the correct `lowbit` for every integer `i`. The `lowbit` function should return `2^k` where `k` is the position of the first 1 in the binary representation of `i`. This portion of the logic seems flawed.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - After populating the array `A`, the program checks if the total sum `s` of the computed lowbits is less than `target`. If it is, the program outputs `-1` (impossible case).

4. **Selection of Elements**:
   - The program then attempts to select elements from `A` to match the `target`, reducing it step by step and appending the corresponding indices to the `selected` list.
   - It prints the size of the `selected` list and the indices.

### Potential Cases Not Handled or Incorrectly Handled

1. **Incorrect Lowbit Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `lowbit` for numbers greater than `1` seems inaccurate. For instance, `lowbit(2)` should yield `2`, but when using `(i & -i) - 1`, it results in `0`. This incorrect calculation propagates throughout the program.

2. **Specific Edge Case**:
   - Consider the case where the inputs are `sum = 1` and `limit = 1`. The expected output should be `1` with the set including `1`, as `lowbit(1) = 1`. However, due to the faulty lowbit calculation, the program might not return the correct output.

3. **Handling of Higher Values**:
   - The program does not handle larger `sum` values correctly if the inputs are not structured to yield valid lowbits. For example, `sum = 3` and `limit = 2` would not yield a valid distinct integer set, but the program may fail to recognize this due to the aforementioned incorrect lowbit calculation.

### Conclusion

Given the faulty calculation of the lowbit and the potential edge cases that the program does not handle correctly, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to compute the lowbit correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain valid inputs as described in the problem.
