You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N towns in the State of Atcoder, connected by M bidirectional roads.

The i-th road connects Town A_i and B_i and has a length of C_i.

Joisino is visiting R towns in the state, r_1,r_2,..,r_R (not necessarily in this order).

She will fly to the first town she visits, and fly back from the last town she visits, but for the rest of the trip she will have to travel by road.

If she visits the towns in the order that minimizes the distance traveled by road, what will that distance be?

Constraints

* 2≤N≤200
* 1≤M≤N×(N-1)/2
* 2≤R≤min(8,N) (min(8,N) is the smaller of 8 and N.)
* r_i≠r_j (i≠j)
* 1≤A_i,B_i≤N, A_i≠B_i
* (A_i,B_i)≠(A_j,B_j),(A_i,B_i)≠(B_j,A_j) (i≠j)
* 1≤C_i≤100000
* Every town can be reached from every town by road.
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M R
r_1 ... r_R
A_1 B_1 C_1
:
A_M B_M C_M


Output

Print the distance traveled by road if Joisino visits the towns in the order that minimizes it.

Program:
```
f = lambda : list(map(int, input().split()))
(N, M, R) = f()
r = f()
(a, b, c) = zip(*map(f, [0] * M))
a = csgraph.dijkstra(csr_matrix((c, (a, b)), [N + 1] * 2), 0, r)
print(int(min((sum((a[e[i]][r[e[i + 1]]] for i in range(R - 1))) for e in __import__('itertools').permutations(range(R))))))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
