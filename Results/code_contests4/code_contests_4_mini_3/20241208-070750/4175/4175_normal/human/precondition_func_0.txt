N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 200, M is an integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ N×(N-1)/2, R is an integer such that 2 ≤ R ≤ min(8, N), r_i are integers representing towns such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ N and r_i are all distinct, A_i and B_i are integers representing roads such that 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N and A_i ≠ B_i, and C_i is an integer representing the length of the road such that 1 ≤ C_i ≤ 100000.
