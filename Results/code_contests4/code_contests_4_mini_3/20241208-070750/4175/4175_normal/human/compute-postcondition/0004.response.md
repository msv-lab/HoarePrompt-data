Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 200; `M` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ `N`×(`N`-1)/2; `R` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `R` ≤ min(8, `N`); `a`, `b`, and `c` are results of mapping function `f` over a list of length `M`; `a` is assigned the output of the dijkstra function applied to the csr_matrix constructed from `c` and pairs `(a, b)` with shape `[N + 1] * 2`, starting from node 0 to node `r`.**
