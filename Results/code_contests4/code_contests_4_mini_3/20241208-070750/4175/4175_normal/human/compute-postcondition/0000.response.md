The code snippet defines a lambda function `f` that will take no arguments and will return a list of integers. The list is created by taking a single line of input, splitting it into separate components, and converting each component to an integer.

Since the initial state does not change the existing values of N, M, R, r_i, A_i, B_i, or C_i, and no specific input is provided for the function invocation, we cannot determine the exact contents of the output from `f`. Thus, the output state remains focused on the definition of the lambda function.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 200, `M` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ `N`×(`N`-1)/2, `R` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `R` ≤ min(8, `N`), `r_i` are integers representing towns such that 1 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `N` and `r_i` are all distinct, `A_i` and `B_i` are integers representing roads such that 1 ≤ `A_i`, `B_i` ≤ `N` and `A_i` ≠ `B_i`, and `C_i` is an integer representing the length of the road such that 1 ≤ `C_i` ≤ 100000; `f` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers from input.**
