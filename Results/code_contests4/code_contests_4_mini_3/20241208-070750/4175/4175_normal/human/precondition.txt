N is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 200, M is an integer where 1 ≤ M ≤ N×(N-1)/2, R is an integer where 2 ≤ R ≤ min(8, N); r_i are distinct integers representing the towns Joisino visits, where 1 ≤ r_i ≤ N; A_i and B_i are distinct integers representing the towns connected by roads, where 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N and A_i ≠ B_i; C_i is an integer representing the length of the road between towns A_i and B_i, where 1 ≤ C_i ≤ 100000.
