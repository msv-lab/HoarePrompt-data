The function reads input values for the number of towns (N), the number of roads (M), and the number of distinct towns to visit (R), along with the specific towns and the roads connecting them. It then calculates the shortest paths between the specified towns using Dijkstra's algorithm and computes the minimum total distance required to visit all specified towns in every possible order. The function does not return any value; it directly prints the result.
