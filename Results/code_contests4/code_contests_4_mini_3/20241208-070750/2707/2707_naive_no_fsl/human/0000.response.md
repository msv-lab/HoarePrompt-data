Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the wealth of candidates is not properly selected to maximize the total arithmetic means for both cities. The logic only sorts the wealth in ascending order and assumes that the highest wealth candidates will always provide the maximum mean when split into two groups.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected output:
The optimal way to choose the candidates to maximize the sum of means would be to select candidates with wealth `4, 5` for the first city and `3, 2` for the second city. This yields:

- City 1: (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5
- City 2: (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

Total = 4.5 + 2.5 = 7.0

However, the program as written selects the two highest wealth candidates for the first city and the next two highest for the second city, which results in:

- City 1: (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5
- City 2: (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

This output is correct, but the program also does not account for the fact that if `n1` and `n2` were reversed, it would yield the same result, yet the logic does not guarantee that this grouping is the optimal one for all scenarios. 

Another test case that clearly demonstrates this flaw:

Input:
```
4 1 3
1 100 100 100
```

Expected output:
- City 1: (100) / 1 = 100
- City 2: (100 + 100) / 3 = 100
Total = 100 + 100 = 200

However, if it mistakenly chooses `1` for city 1 and `100, 100, 100` for city 2, it would yield:

- City 1: (1) / 1 = 1
- City 2: (100 + 100 + 100) / 3 = 100
Total = 1 + 100 = 101

Thus, the program does not guarantee the maximum possible sum of means for the two cities, which violates the problem description that specifically states the need for maximizing the arithmetic means. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect due to its lack of handling all configurations of wealth distributions correctly.
