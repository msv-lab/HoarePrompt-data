To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and flow of the code.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to maximize the sum of the arithmetic means of wealth for two cities based on the wealth of candidates.
- We are given `n` candidates and must select `n1` candidates for the first city and `n2` candidates for the second city.
- The candidates can only be selected from the `n` candidates, and the wealth of the candidates is given in a list.

### Code Logic:
1. The input values for `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are read and stored, and then the wealth list `a` is created.
2. The wealth list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
3. If `n1` is greater than `n2`, the values of `n1` and `n2` are swapped to simplify the subsequent selection of candidates.
4. The program sums the wealth of the `n1` richest candidates (which are the last `n1` elements of the sorted list) for the first city.
5. It then sums the wealth of the `n2` richest candidates from the remaining candidates (the next `n2` candidates after the first `n1` candidates).
6. Finally, it calculates and prints the total arithmetic mean.

### Potential Issues:
The program seems to correctly identify the wealthiest candidates based on the sorted list and computes the means appropriately. However, we can identify a potential flaw:

- **Edge Case**: If `n1 + n2` equals `n`, it will not leave any candidates for selection beyond the first city. This means that the program assumes `n1` will always be less than `n` and `n2` will always be less than `n` when in reality, if `n1 + n2 = n`, the last candidates will not be available after selecting `n1` for the first city. The logic does not account for this and will lead to incorrect indexing.

#### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
3 2 1
1 2 3
```
Here, `n = 3`, `n1 = 2`, `n2 = 1`. The wealth array is `[1, 2, 3]`. 
- The first city would ideally take candidates with wealth `2` and `3`, summing to `5`, yielding a mean of `5/2 = 2.5`.
- The second city would take the candidate with wealth `1`, yielding a mean of `1/1 = 1`.
- The total would be `2.5 + 1 = 3.5`.

However, the program logic would incorrectly sum up wealth, potentially causing an incorrect mean calculation since it does not handle the last candidates specifically when `n1 + n2 = n`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where `n1 + n2 = n` correctly, leading to potential index errors or incorrect arithmetic mean calculations.
