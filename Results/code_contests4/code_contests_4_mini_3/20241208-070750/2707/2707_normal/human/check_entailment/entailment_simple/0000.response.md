To determine whether the given program meets the requirements of the problem description, let's analyze the key components of the problem and the corresponding code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: 
   - `n`: Total number of candidates.
   - `n1`: Number of people in the first city.
   - `n2`: Number of people in the second city.
   - `a`: List of wealth values for each candidate.

2. **Objective**: 
   - Maximize the sum of the arithmetic means of the wealth of people in each of the two cities.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each candidate can only settle in one city.
   - The arithmetic mean for each city is calculated as the sum of wealth of its residents divided by the number of residents.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Sorting**: 
   - The wealth list `a` is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Assigning Cities**: 
   - The program checks if `n1 > n2` and swaps them if necessary, ensuring `n1` is always less than or equal to `n2`. This is a valid strategy for simplifying the logic as we can always allocate the larger group last.

3. **Calculating Wealth Sums**:
   - The program calculates `s1`, which is the sum of the top `n1` wealth values (the richest candidates) by iterating over the last `n1` elements of the sorted list in reverse.
   - Next, it calculates `s2`, which is the sum of the next `n2` wealth values (second richest candidates) by iterating over the next `n2` richest candidates after selecting for the first city.

4. **Output**: 
   - The program prints the sum of the means by dividing `s1` by `n1` and `s2` by `n2`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The selection of the richest candidates for each city ensures that the means are maximized.
- For `n1` and `n2`, the program correctly handles swapping to always select the smaller group first, which simplifies the logic without loss of generality.
- The way the program computes the sums `s1` and `s2` directly correlates with the requirement to maximize the arithmetic means.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem requirements by correctly identifying the subsets of candidates that yield the maximum sum of arithmetic means, as described in the problem. It efficiently handles the data within the constraints, and its results will always be accurate as it selects the optimal candidates based on wealth.

Therefore, the output for the correctness check is:

Correctness: **True**
