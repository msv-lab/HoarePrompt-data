You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Local authorities have heard a lot about combinatorial abilities of Ostap Bender so they decided to ask his help in the question of urbanization. There are n people who plan to move to the cities. The wealth of the i of them is equal to ai. Authorities plan to build two cities, first for n1 people and second for n2 people. Of course, each of n candidates can settle in only one of the cities. Thus, first some subset of candidates of size n1 settle in the first city and then some subset of size n2 is chosen among the remaining candidates and the move to the second city. All other candidates receive an official refuse and go back home.

To make the statistic of local region look better in the eyes of their bosses, local authorities decided to pick subsets of candidates in such a way that the sum of arithmetic mean of wealth of people in each of the cities is as large as possible. Arithmetic mean of wealth in one city is the sum of wealth ai among all its residents divided by the number of them (n1 or n2 depending on the city). The division should be done in real numbers without any rounding.

Please, help authorities find the optimal way to pick residents for two cities.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, n1 and n2 (1 ≤ n, n1, n2 ≤ 100 000, n1 + n2 ≤ n) — the number of candidates who want to move to the cities, the planned number of residents of the first city and the planned number of residents of the second city.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 000), the i-th of them is equal to the wealth of the i-th candidate.

Output

Print one real value — the maximum possible sum of arithmetic means of wealth of cities' residents. You answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

Examples

Input

2 1 1
1 5


Output

6.00000000


Input

4 2 1
1 4 2 3


Output

6.50000000

Note

In the first sample, one of the optimal solutions is to move candidate 1 to the first city and candidate 2 to the second.

In the second sample, the optimal solution is to pick candidates 3 and 4 for the first city, and candidate 2 for the second one. Thus we obtain (a3 + a4) / 2 + a2 = (3 + 2) / 2 + 4 = 6.5
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, n1, and n2 are integers such that 1 ≤ n, n1, n2 ≤ 100,000 and n1 + n2 ≤ n; a is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000.
def func():
    n, n1, n2 = (int(i) for i in raw_input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
    a.sort()
    if (n1 > n2) :
        n1, n2 = n2, n1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers. If `n1` is greater than `n2`, then `n1` is updated to the previous value of `n2`, `n2` is updated to the previous value of `n1`, and `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers.
    s1 = 0
    for i in range(n1):
        s1 += a[n - i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`.
    s2 = 0
    for i in range(n2):
        s2 += a[n - n1 - i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`, `s2` is the sum of the last `min(n2, n1)` elements of `a`, `i` is `n2 - 1`.
    print(1.0 * s1 / n1 + 1.0 * s2 / n2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers, `n`, `n1`, and `n2`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the average of the largest `n1` elements and the next largest `n2` elements from the sorted list `a`, returning the sum of these two averages. If `n1` is greater than `n2`, their values are swapped. The function may not handle cases where `n1` or `n2` is zero, which could lead to division by zero errors. Additionally, it assumes that `n1 + n2` is less than or equal to `n`, which should be validated.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
