The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `n1`, and `n2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is an integer, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is an integer, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers**.
