The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `n1`, and `n2`, which are all integers. The values of `n`, `n1`, and `n2` must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ n, n1, n2 ≤ 100,000 and n1 + n2 ≤ n. Additionally, the function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer `ai` in the list must satisfy 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000. The function performs operations based on these parameters and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer), n1 (an integer), n2 (an integer), and a (a list of n integers). It returns a result based on the input parameters while ensuring the constraints on n, n1, n2, and the elements of the list a are met.**
