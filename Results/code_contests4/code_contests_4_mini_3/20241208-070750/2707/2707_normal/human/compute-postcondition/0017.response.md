According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n2`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. This means `i` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n2` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`, `s2` is increased by a[n - n1 - 1], `i` is 1**
