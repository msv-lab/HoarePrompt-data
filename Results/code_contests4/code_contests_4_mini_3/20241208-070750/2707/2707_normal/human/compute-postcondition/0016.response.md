The value of `s2` is increased by the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]`. Given that `i` is currently 0, the expression simplifies to `a[n - n1 - 1]`. The values of `n`, `n1`, and `a` are needed to determine the exact value being added to `s2`. However, since the output state does not need specific calculations due to the variable nature of the inputs, we can summarize the effect.

The state of `s2` changes, while other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`, `s2` is increased by `a[n - n1 - 1]`, `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`, `s2` is increased by a[n - n1 - 1], `i` is still 0**
