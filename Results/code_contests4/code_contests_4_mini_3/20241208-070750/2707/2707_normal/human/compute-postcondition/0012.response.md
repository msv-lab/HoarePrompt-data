The variable `s1` is updated by adding the value of `a[n - i - 1]` to it. The value of `i` is 2, so `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 2 - 1`, which is `n - 3`. Therefore, `s1` is increased by the value of `a[n - 3]`. 

Since `n` is greater than 2, `n - 3` will be valid as long as `n` is at least 4, ensuring that `a[n - 3]` exists in the sorted list `a`.

Thus, the updated value of `s1` becomes `s1 + a[n - 3]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is greater than 2, `n2` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is `s1 + a[n - 3]`, `i` is 2**
