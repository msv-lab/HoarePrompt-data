According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n1` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n1` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is greater than 2, `n2` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`, `i` is 2**
