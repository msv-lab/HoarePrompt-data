The variable `s2` is increased by the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]`. The previous value of `i` is 1, which means we need to substitute `i` into the expression. The expression becomes `s2 += a[n - n1 - 1 - 1]` or `s2 += a[n - n1 - 2]`. 

The other variables' values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`, `s2` is increased by `a[n - n1 - 2]`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`, `s2` is increased by `a[n - n1 - 2]`, `i` is 1**
