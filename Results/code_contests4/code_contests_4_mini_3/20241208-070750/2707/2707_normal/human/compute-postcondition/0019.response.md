According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n2`. The loop is designed to execute `n2` times, and the variable `i` keeps track of the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.

Since `n2` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2.

State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`, `s2` is increased by `a[n - n1 - 2]`, `i` is 2**
