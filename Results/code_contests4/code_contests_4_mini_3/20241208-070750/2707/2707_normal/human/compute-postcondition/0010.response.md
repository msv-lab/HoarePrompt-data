The code modifies the variable `s1` by adding the value of `a[n - i - 1]` to it. The value of `i` is 1, so we calculate the index as `n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The variable `s1` is initially set to `a[n - 1]`. Therefore, after the execution, `s1` becomes `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is greater than 1, `n2` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`, `i` is 1**
