The values of `n1` and `n2` are swapped, where `n1` is initially greater than `n2`. After executing the code, `n1` will take the previous value of `n2`, and `n2` will take the previous value of `n1`. Therefore, the values of `n1` and `n2` are now reversed, maintaining the condition that `n1` is still greater than `n2`. The state of the other variables (`n` and `a`) remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is now equal to the previous value of `n2`, `n2` is now equal to the previous value of `n1`, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers.**
