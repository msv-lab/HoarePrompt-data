According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1. 

Additionally, since there is a constraint that `n1` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, `n1` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is greater than 1, `n2` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is `a[n - 1]`, `i` is 1**
