Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is the sum of the last `min(n1, n)` elements of `a`, `s2` is the sum of the last `min(n2, n1)` elements of `a`, `i` is `n2 - 1`, and the output is the calculated value of `1.0 * s1 / n1 + 1.0 * s2 / n2`.**
