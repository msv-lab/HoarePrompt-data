The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers created from the input string, where each integer is obtained by converting elements from the input split by spaces. The initial values of `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are not directly affected; however, `a` now holds a list of `n` integers that fall within the specified constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is an integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is an integer, `n2` is an integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers**.
