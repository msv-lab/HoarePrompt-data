The value of `s1` is incremented by the value of `a[n - i - 1]`. Since `n` is an integer and `i` is 0 for the first iteration of the loop, we compute `a[n - 0 - 1]`, which simplifies to `a[n - 1]`. Thus, `s1` becomes `s1 + a[n - 1]`. The variable `s1` changes from 0 to `a[n - 1]`, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `n1` is greater than 0, `n2` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is `a[n - 1]`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n1` is greater than 0, `n2` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `s1` is `a[n - 1]`, `i` is 0**
