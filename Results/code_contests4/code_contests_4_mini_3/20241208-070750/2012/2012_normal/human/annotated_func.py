#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeros allowed, and both strings have a length of at most 1,000,000 characters.
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    if (alen > blen) :
        return '>'
        #The program returns '>' indicating that string 'a' representing a non-negative integer is greater than string 'b', which also represents a non-negative integer.
    else :
        if (alen < blen) :
            return '<'
            #The program returns '<' indicating that string 'a' is less than string 'b' because 'a' is shorter in length and represents a non-negative integer.
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeros allowed, both strings have a length of at most 1,000,000 characters, the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeros allowed, both strings have a length of at most 1,000,000 characters, the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`.
    while i < allen and j < bllen:
        if a[i] < b[j]:
            return '<'
        elif a[i] > b[j]:
            return '>'
        
        i += 1
        
        j += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `allen`, `j` is equal to `bllen`, `a` and `b` are equal if the loop completes without returning, otherwise one is less than or greater than the other based on the first non-matching character encountered.
    return '='
    #The program returns '=' indicating that the strings `i` (allen) and `j` (bllen) are equal based on the completion of the loop without finding any non-matching characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two strings `a` and `b` representing non-negative integers (with leading zeros allowed) and two integer indices `i` and `j`. It compares the values of `a` and `b` based on their lengths and character-by-character comparisons, returning '>' if `a` is greater, '<' if `a` is less, or '=' if they are equal. The function correctly handles cases where the lengths of the strings differ and continues comparing individual characters until it finds a difference or confirms equality, but it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are empty strings. If both strings are empty, the function may lead to an out-of-bounds error due to the comparison logic.
