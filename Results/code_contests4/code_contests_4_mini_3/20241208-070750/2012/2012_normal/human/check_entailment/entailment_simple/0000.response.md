Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the functionality described in the problem statement.

1. **Undefined Variables**: The function references `alen`, `blen`, `allen`, and `bllen` which are not defined anywhere in the function. These variables are supposed to hold the lengths of the input strings `a` and `b`, but since they are undefined, the program will raise a NameError when executed.

2. **Initialization of Indices**: The parameters `i` and `j` are passed to the function, but there is no indication of their initial values (usually they should start at 0). This could lead to incorrect behavior depending on how the function is called.

3. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The logic for comparing the two numbers does not explicitly handle leading zeros. While the length comparison will naturally handle this (since leading zeros do not affect the length of the string), it should be clearly stated in the logic. However, as implemented, it will still work as expected due to string comparison, but the explanation lacks clarity.

4. **Potential Infinite Loop**: If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal but the strings are not equal, the loop may not terminate correctly if not all characters are compared properly. This can happen if the indices `i` and `j` are not incremented correctly.

5. **Output Format**: The output format needs to ensure that the symbols are printed correctly. The problem description states to print `<`, `>`, or `=`. However, the example outputs show HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`), which is inconsistent with the expected output.

Due to these issues, the program does not consistently fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
