You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: a and b are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeros allowed, and both strings have a length of at most 1,000,000 characters.
```
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns '>' indicating that string 'a' representing a non-negative integer is greater than string 'b', which also represents a non-negative integer.

Case_2: The program returns '<' indicating that string 'a' is less than string 'b' because 'a' is shorter in length and represents a non-negative integer.

Case_3: The program returns the string '<' indicating that the character at position `i` in string `a` is less than the character at position `j` in string `b`.

Case_4: The program returns '>' indicating that the character from string 'a' at index 'i' is greater than the character from string 'b' at index 'j'

Case_5: The program returns the string '<'

Case_6: The program returns the character '>'

Case_7: The program returns the string '<'

Case_8: The program returns the string '>' indicating a continuation of the loop as long as 'allen' is greater than 'i + 1' and 'bllen' is greater than 'j + 1'.

Case_9: The program returns '=' indicating that the strings `i` (allen) and `j` (bllen) are equal based on the completion of the loop without finding any non-matching characters.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
