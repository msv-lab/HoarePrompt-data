The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is known, but its specific value is not provided. The states of other variables (`a`, `b`, `allen`, `bllen`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers; `allen` and `bllen` are greater than 0; `i` is increased by 1; and the conditions regarding `a[i]` and `b[j]` still hold.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers; `allen` and `bllen` are greater than 0; `i` is increased by 1; and the conditions regarding `a[i]` and `b[j]` still hold.**
