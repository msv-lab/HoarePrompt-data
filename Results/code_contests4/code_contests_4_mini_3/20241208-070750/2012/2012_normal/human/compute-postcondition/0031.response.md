The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. The parameters `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, which may contain leading zeros and have a maximum length of 1,000,000 characters. The parameters `i` and `j` are integers representing the indices of characters in strings `a` and `b`, respectively.

After executing the function body, the function can return the following:

- **Case 1**: The function returns '>' if string `a` is greater than string `b`.
- **Case 2**: The function returns '<' if string `a` is shorter than string `b`.
- **Case 3**: The function returns '<' if the character at index `i` in string `a` is less than the character at index `j` in string `b`.
- **Case 4**: The function returns '>' if the character at index `i` in string `a` is greater than the character at index `j` in string `b`.
- **Case 5**: The function returns '<' under a certain condition.
- **Case 6**: The function returns '>' in a different scenario.
- **Case 7**: The function returns '<' in another specific condition.
- **Case 8**: The function returns '>' indicating the continuation of a loop as long as certain conditions are met regarding the lengths of `a` and `b`.
- **Case 9**: The function returns '=' if the comparisons throughout the loop conclude that the substrings are equal.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two strings `a` and `b` representing non-negative integers and two indices `i` and `j`, and return a comparison result based on different conditions related to their values and lengths. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b` (strings representing non-negative integers), and `i` and `j` (integer indices). It returns comparison results between `a` and `b` based on their values, lengths, and specific character comparisons.**
