Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings `a` and `b` representing non-negative integers (with leading zeros allowed) and two integer indices `i` and `j`. It compares the values of `a` and `b` based on their lengths and character-by-character comparisons, returning '>' if `a` is greater, '<' if `a` is less, or '=' if they are equal. The function correctly handles cases where the lengths of the strings differ and continues comparing individual characters until it finds a difference or confirms equality, but it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are empty strings. If both strings are empty, the function may lead to an out-of-bounds error due to the comparison logic.**
