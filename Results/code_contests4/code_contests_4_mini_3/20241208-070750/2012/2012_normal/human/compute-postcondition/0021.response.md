The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The value of `i` has already been increased by 1, but no further changes are made to it. Therefore, the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1, and variable `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1, variable `j` is increased by 1**
