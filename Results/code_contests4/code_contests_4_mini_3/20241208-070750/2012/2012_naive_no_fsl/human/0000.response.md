Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both numbers are equal but contain leading zeros properly. For example, if we input the following:

```
000000000
000000000
```

The expected output should be `=`, but the program does not account for this case since it trims leading zeros and then compares the lengths and values. 

When both `a` and `b` are equal after trimming, the function `func_1` will not reach the comparison logic that checks for equality, as it will return `=` only if the lengths are equal and all digits are compared. However, if both inputs consist solely of zeros, they are trimmed to an empty string, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

Another potential case is when one number is `0` with leading zeros and the other is `0` without leading zeros. For example:

```
00000
0
```

The expected output is `=`, but the program may not handle the leading zeros correctly in all scenarios.

Thus, there are cases where the program does not behave as required by the problem description, leading to its incorrectness.
