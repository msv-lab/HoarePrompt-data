To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code.

The goal is to find the maximum number of tables that can be decorated using red, green, and blue balloons, ensuring that no table has balloons of the same color.

### Analyzing the Code
1. The code starts by sorting the counts of the balloons so that `r` represents the minimum count among the three colors.
2. Then, it tries to allocate balloons to tables:
   - It first uses up `r` balloons from `g` and `b`.
   - It adds to the table count `t` based on how many sets of three can be formed from the remaining `g` balloons.
   - It then adjusts the counts of `g` and `b` after that allocation.
   - Finally, it checks if there are any remaining balloons that can still form valid sets of three and adds those to the table count.

### Potential Case to Falsify Correctness
Let's look at a case where the balloon counts do not allow for maximum table decoration:
- **Case: r = 0, g = 0, b = 2**
  - According to the logic in the code, it would sort the values to `r = 0`, `g = 0`, `b = 2`.
  - Since there are no red or green balloons, the maximum number of tables should be `0`.
  - However, the code does not handle this case properly. It starts with `t = r`, which is `0`, and then it tries to allocate from `g`, which is also `0`, leading to an incorrect conclusion in some scenarios.

Let's run through some numbers:
- **Input:** `0 0 2`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Actual Output: The logic will still try to allocate based on `g` and `b`, which may not yield the correct result.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where all balloon counts do not allow for any tables to be decorated, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
