To verify the correctness of the annotated program against the given problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

The problem requires calculating the maximum number of tables \( t \) that can be decorated using exactly three balloons of different colors, given a certain number of red, green, and blue balloons (\( r, g, b \)). 

### Breakdown of the Function

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input and sorts the values of \( r, g, b \). This is done to ensure that \( r \) is the smallest, \( g \) is the middle, and \( b \) is the largest. This is a useful approach since we want to pair the smaller counts with the larger counts.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable \( t \) is initialized to \( r \), which represents the number of tables that can be decorated using one balloon of the smallest color.
   - The function then reduces \( g \) and \( b \) by \( r \) since those balloons can be used to match the \( r \) balloons.

3. **Calculating Tables**:
   - The next step calculates how many additional tables can be formed from the remaining green balloons. This is done using integer division by 3 (`g // 3`), since 3 balloons are needed to form a complete table.
   - The remaining green balloons after forming additional tables are calculated by taking the modulo 3 of \( g \).
   - The program then checks if there are still enough blue balloons left to form additional tables with the remaining green balloons. This is done with logical checks for the remaining \( g \) values, adding to \( t \) accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the function `func_2` is meant to print the result.

### Analysis of Correctness

The logic implemented in `func_1` adheres to the constraints and requirements set by the problem description:

- The program correctly considers the constraints of using balloons of different colors.
- It handles edge cases, such as when one or more colors run out (which is inherently managed through the sorting and subsequent calculations).
- The use of integer operations ensures that the number of tables calculated will always be an integer, which is appropriate since tables cannot be partially decorated.

### Conclusion

After examining the function and its steps in relation to the problem description, we can confirm that the program meets the requirements of the problem. It correctly computes the maximum number of tables that can be decorated given the constraints and specifications.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be asserted as:

Correctness: **True**
