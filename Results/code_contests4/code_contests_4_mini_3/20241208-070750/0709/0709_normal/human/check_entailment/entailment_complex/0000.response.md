To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and the annotations in detail.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with three balloons of different colors (red, green, and blue). Each table requires exactly three balloons, and no two balloons can be of the same color.

### Analyzing the Code
#### Function `func_1`
- It starts by reading the input values for `r`, `g`, and `b`, which represent the counts of red, green, and blue balloons respectively.
- The counts are sorted, so `r` will always be the smallest value.
- The code calculates the maximum number `t` of tables that can be decorated by:
  1. Setting `t` to the count of the smallest color balloons (`r`).
  2. Reducing the counts of green and blue balloons by `r`.
  3. Adding to `t` the number of full sets of three that can be formed from the remaining green balloons.
  4. Adjusting the counts of blue balloons based on the remaining green balloons.
  5. Checking if the remaining green balloons can form additional tables with blue balloons.

#### Edge Cases
The function attempts to handle several scenarios:
- If one color has all balloons and the others have fewer, it will correctly set `t` to the count of the smallest color.
- It also correctly handles cases where the remaining counts might allow for additional combinations.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function simply prints the output value `t`, but does not contribute to the logic of balloon counts or table decoration.

### Potential Issues
While the logic appears sound in most cases, we should consider some edge cases:
1. **All Balloons Zero**: If `r = 0`, `g = 0`, and `b = 0`, the code should return `t = 0`.
2. **All Balloons Equal**: If all balloon counts are equal but less than 3, e.g., `r = 1`, `g = 1`, `b = 1`, the code returns `t = 1`, which is correct.
3. **Balloons with Large Counts**: The algorithm sorts and processes counts efficiently, but we need to ensure it handles cases where one color is significantly larger than the others.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the logic and edge cases, the code appears to cover the requirements of the problem description correctly in terms of calculating the maximum number of tables that can be decorated.

Thus, I have not identified any case where the code fails to adhere to the problem description or produces an incorrect output based on the example scenarios provided.

Correctness: **True**
