The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters representing quantities of red, green, and blue balloons, respectively. It calculates a value `t` based on the number of balloons that can be formed from the available colors, taking into account the minimum of the three counts and how many full sets of three can be made from the green balloons. The function then calls another function `func_2` with this calculated value `t`. The function does not return any value.
