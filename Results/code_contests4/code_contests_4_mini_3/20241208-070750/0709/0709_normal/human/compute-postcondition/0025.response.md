Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters `r`, `g`, and `b`, which are non-negative integers representing the counts of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. It prints the string representations of all elements in the iterable `args`, separated by a specified separator `sep`, and followed by a specified ending string from `kwargs`. If specified, it also flushes the output stream. However, the function does not utilize the parameters `r`, `g`, and `b` in its operation, thus they are irrelevant within this context. **
