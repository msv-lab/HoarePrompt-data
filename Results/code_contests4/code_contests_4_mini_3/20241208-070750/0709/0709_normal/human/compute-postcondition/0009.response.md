According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the iterable `args`. Since `args` is a non-empty iterable and has already been written to the output, we need to consider how the loop progresses through `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `args`, and it has been processed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `x` to the next element in `args`. Given that `at_start` remains False, it indicates that we've already started processing elements. Therefore, `x` must now be the second element in `args`.

If `args` contains at least two elements, then the loop can execute again with `x` being the second element. 

State: **`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the second element in `args`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `args` must have at least 2 elements.**
