The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the output file (which is `sys.stdout` in this case). The initial state has `sep` as a string containing a space (' '), and since other variables are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args`, and a space has been written to the output.
