Postcondition: ***`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` has written the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` has been written to `file`.***
