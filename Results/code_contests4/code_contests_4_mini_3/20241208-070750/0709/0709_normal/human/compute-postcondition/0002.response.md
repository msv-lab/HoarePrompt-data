The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged as `r`, `g`, and `b` are still non-negative integers representing the number of balloons, and `sep` and `file` retain their assigned values. Therefore, the output state is: `r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout; `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout; `at_start` is True**
