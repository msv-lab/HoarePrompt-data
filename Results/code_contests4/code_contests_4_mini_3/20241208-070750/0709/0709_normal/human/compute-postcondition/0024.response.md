The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `r`, `g`, and `b`. Each of these parameters is a non-negative integer representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively, constrained by the condition that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9. The function returns a value based on the relationships and constraints of these parameters. 

However, since the output conditions or logic are not provided, I cannot specify the exact return values based on the input parameters at this moment.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters r, g, and b, which are non-negative integers representing the counts of red, green, and blue balloons respectively.**
