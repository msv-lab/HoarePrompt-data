Postcondition: ***`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers; `sep` is ' '; `file` has written the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable; all elements of `args` have been written to the output; the string represented by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the file has been flushed.***
