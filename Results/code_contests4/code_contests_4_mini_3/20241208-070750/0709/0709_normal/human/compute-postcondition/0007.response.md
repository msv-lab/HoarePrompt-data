In the given code snippet, `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of the variable `x` to the output file, which is `sys.stdout`. The initial state indicates that `x` is the first element in `args`, which is non-empty. Since `at_start` is False, a space has already been written to the output.

The output state reflects that `x` has been converted to a string and written to the output. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `x` has been written to the output.**
