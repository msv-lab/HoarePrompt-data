The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `prices`, which is a list of `n` positive integers, each not exceeding 100. The function also processes `m` lines of input containing names of fruits, where each fruit name is a non-empty string composed of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32. The number of distinct fruit names does not exceed `n`.

The function does not return values explicitly stated in the output, hence it is not clear what the return value is based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters n and m, a list of n positive integers prices, and m fruit names as strings, while ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.**
