Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the number of prices and the number of fruit names, respectively. It reads a list of `n` positive integers (prices) and `m` fruit names. It then calculates two weighted sums: `mini`, which is the sum of the smallest prices multiplied by the count of each fruit, and `maxi`, which is the sum of the largest prices multiplied by the count of each fruit. The function prints these two sums. If `m` is 0, both sums will be 0, but the function does not explicitly handle this edge case, so no additional output is generated in that scenario. **
