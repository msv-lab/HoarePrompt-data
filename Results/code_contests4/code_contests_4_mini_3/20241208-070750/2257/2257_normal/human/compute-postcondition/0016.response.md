According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `counts` list. The loop will execute if there is at least one element in the `counts` list, which means `len(counts)` must be greater than 0. The current state indicates that `i` is initialized to `m-1`, but this does not impact the execution of the loop directly since `i` will be re-assigned in the loop.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the states accordingly:
1. `counts` must be a sorted list with at least 1 element (i.e., `len(counts) > 0`).
2. Since `i` is initialized to `m-1`, this value does not need to be adjusted for the loop's first execution.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm `counts` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `cs` is a sorted list of integers, `buy` contains the count of each unique input string received, `i` is `m-1`, `nf` is the last input string received (if `m` is greater than 0), `counts` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is 0**
