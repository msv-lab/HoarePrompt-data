According to the code, the loop iterates based on the length of the `counts` list. The variable `i` is used as an index, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `counts`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `counts` minus 1, as the loop iterates from 0 to `len(counts) - 1`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

If `i` was `len(counts) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `len(counts)` which is equal to the length of `counts`.

State: **`maxi` is updated by adding the product of `cs[-(len(counts))]` and `counts[-(len(counts))]`; `mini` is updated by adding `cs[len(counts) - 1] * counts[-(len(counts))]`, for the loop to execute a second time `counts` must have at least `len(counts) + 1` elements and `i` is `len(counts)`**
