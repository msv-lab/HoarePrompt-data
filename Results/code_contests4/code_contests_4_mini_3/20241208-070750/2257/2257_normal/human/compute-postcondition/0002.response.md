The code initializes an empty dictionary `buy`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `cs` remain unchanged and retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers assigned from the input values; `cs` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `buy` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers assigned from the input values; `cs` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `buy` is an empty dictionary.**
