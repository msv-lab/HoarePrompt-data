The variable `mini` is updated by adding the product of `cs[i]` and `counts[-i - 1]`. The previous value of `mini` is not provided, but the calculation for the new value is based on the current values of `cs[i]` and `counts[-i - 1]`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxi` is updated by adding the product of `cs[-i - 1]` and `counts[-i - 1] and `mini` is updated by adding `cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]`.

Output State: **`maxi` is updated by adding the product of `cs[-i - 1]` and `counts[-i - 1]`; `mini` is updated by adding `cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]`.**
