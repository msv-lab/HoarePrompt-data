The code takes input values, splits them into a list, converts each element to an integer, and then sorts that list. The variables `n` and `m` are assigned from the input values, which are not directly affected by this operation. The variable `cs` is created as a sorted list of integers based on the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `cs` and the unchanged state of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers assigned from the input values; `cs` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
