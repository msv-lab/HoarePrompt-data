To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the situation step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have `n` price tags corresponding to `n` different fruits.
2. Valera has a list of `m` fruits he wants to buy, which may include duplicates.
3. We need to calculate:
   - The minimum possible total price (in the best-case scenario for Valera, where the cheapest prices match the most frequently wanted fruits).
   - The maximum possible total price (in the worst-case scenario for Valera, where the most expensive prices match the most frequently wanted fruits).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads the values of `n` and `m`.
   - It collects the prices and sorts them.
   - It builds a dictionary to count the occurrences of each fruit name.

2. **Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Prices**:
   - For `maxi`, it multiplies the highest prices by the counts of the fruits in reverse order.
   - For `mini`, it multiplies the lowest prices by the counts of the fruits in reverse order.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Handling of `m = 0`**: The problem description does not explicitly mention handling for `m = 0`, but it implies that `m` is at least 1 based on the given constraints (`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`). However, if `m` were to be 0, the code would not handle it properly as it would lead to no fruit names being read, resulting in an empty dictionary and subsequent calculation issues.

2. **Multiple Occurrences of the Same Fruit**: The program correctly counts multiple occurrences of the same fruit, so it handles this case well.

3. **Correct Mapping of Prices**: The program seems to match the lowest counts with the lowest prices and the highest counts with the highest prices correctly.

### Output Hints:
The hints indicate that the function computes two weighted sums based on the counts and prices, which aligns with the description of what the function is intended to do. However, they mention that if `m` is 0, the sums would be 0, but the program does not explicitly handle this case, which is an edge case that could lead to incorrect results if `m` were to be 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible sums based on the fruit price tags and their respective counts. However, it fails to handle the edge case of `m = 0`, which makes it not fully compliant with the problem description. Since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically the case where `m = 0`), we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The failure to handle the case of `m = 0` is a clear example of when the program does not work correctly.
