The program described performs the following steps:

1. It reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the number of price tags (or different kinds of fruits) and the number of fruits Valera wants to buy, respectively.
2. It reads a list of `n` integers, which are the prices of the fruits, and sorts them.
3. It then reads `m` fruit names, counting the occurrences of each fruit in a dictionary called `buy`.
4. After collecting the counts of each fruit, it sorts these counts.
5. It calculates `maxi` as the weighted sum of the highest prices multiplied by their respective fruit counts and `mini` as the weighted sum of the lowest prices multiplied by the same counts.
6. Finally, it prints both sums.

Let's analyze if the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

- The program correctly reads the number of price tags and the number of fruits Valera wants.
- It correctly collects the fruit names and counts their occurrences.
- The program calculates the maximum possible price (by multiplying the highest prices with the counts of the fruits) and the minimum possible price (by multiplying the lowest prices with the counts), which is exactly what the problem description requires.
- The output format matches the specified format in the problem description.

However, there is a small issue regarding the handling of the case when `m` is 0. Although the problem guarantees that `m` will be at least 1, the code does not explicitly handle the situation where `m` is 0 and suggests that both sums would be 0 in that case. Since the problem guarantees that at least one fruit will be present, this situation will not occur in practice.

Given that the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description and handles the expected input correctly, we conclude that it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
