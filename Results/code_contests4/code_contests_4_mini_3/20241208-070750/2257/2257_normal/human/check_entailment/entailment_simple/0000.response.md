To determine the correctness of the provided Python program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Structure**:
   - The first line contains two integers, `n` (the number of price tags) and `m` (the number of fruits Valera wants to buy).
   - The second line consists of `n` positive integers representing the prices of the fruits.
   - The next `m` lines contain the names of the fruits Valera wants to buy.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - The program must output two integers: the minimum and maximum total price Valera may need to pay for the fruits.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The first line reads `n` and `m`.
   - The second line reads the list of prices and sorts them in ascending order.
   - The subsequent lines read the names of the fruits and count how many of each fruit Valera wants to buy using a dictionary.

2. **Calculating Minimum and Maximum Prices**:
   - The counts of how many of each fruit Valera wants to buy are sorted in ascending order.
   - The maximum price is calculated by pairing the most expensive prices with the highest counts of fruits. This is done by iterating over the counts from the end of the sorted list and multiplying them with the corresponding prices from the end of the sorted prices list.
   - The minimum price is calculated similarly, but it pairs the cheapest prices with the highest counts.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the minimum and maximum prices.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The logic for calculating the minimum and maximum prices is correct. It ensures:
  - For maximum price, it uses the highest price tags for the most frequently requested fruits.
  - For minimum price, it uses the lowest price tags for the most frequently requested fruits.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where `m` could be less than or equal to `n`, thus correctly employing the available price tags.
- It also handles the case where multiple entries for a fruit are counted correctly due to the dictionary structure.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. All edge cases and specifications have been taken into account, and the calculations for minimum and maximum prices are done accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
