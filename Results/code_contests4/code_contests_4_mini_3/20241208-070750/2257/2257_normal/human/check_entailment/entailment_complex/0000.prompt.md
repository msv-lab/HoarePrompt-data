You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The spring is coming and it means that a lot of fruits appear on the counters. One sunny day little boy Valera decided to go shopping. He made a list of m fruits he wanted to buy. If Valera want to buy more than one fruit of some kind, he includes it into the list several times. 

When he came to the fruit stall of Ashot, he saw that the seller hadn't distributed price tags to the goods, but put all price tags on the counter. Later Ashot will attach every price tag to some kind of fruits, and Valera will be able to count the total price of all fruits from his list. But Valera wants to know now what can be the smallest total price (in case of the most «lucky» for him distribution of price tags) and the largest total price (in case of the most «unlucky» for him distribution of price tags).

Input

The first line of the input contains two integer number n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of price tags (which is equal to the number of different kinds of fruits that Ashot sells) and the number of items in Valera's list. The second line contains n space-separated positive integer numbers. Each of them doesn't exceed 100 and stands for the price of one fruit of some kind. The following m lines contain names of the fruits from the list. Each name is a non-empty string of small Latin letters which length doesn't exceed 32. It is guaranteed that the number of distinct fruits from the list is less of equal to n. Also it is known that the seller has in stock all fruits that Valera wants to buy.

Output

Print two numbers a and b (a ≤ b) — the minimum and the maximum possible sum which Valera may need to buy all fruits from his list.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; prices is a list of n positive integers, each not exceeding 100; and the subsequent m lines contain names of fruits, each name being a non-empty string of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32. The number of distinct fruit names does not exceed n.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    cs = sorted(list(map(int, raw_input().split())))
    buy = dict()
    for i in range(m):
        nf = raw_input()
        
        buy[nf] = buy.get(nf, 0) + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `cs` is a sorted list of integers, `buy` contains the count of each unique input string received, `i` is `m-1`, `nf` is the last input string received (if `m` is greater than 0).
    counts = sorted(list(buy.values()))
    maxi = 0
    mini = 0
    for i in range(len(counts)):
        maxi += cs[-i - 1] * counts[-i - 1]
        
        mini += cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `maxi` is the weighted sum of the largest elements in `cs` with their respective counts, `mini` is the weighted sum of the smallest elements in `cs` with the same counts. If `m` is 0, then `maxi` and `mini` are both 0.
    print('%d %d' % (mini, maxi))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the number of prices and the number of fruit names, respectively. It reads a list of `n` positive integers (prices) and `m` fruit names. It then calculates two weighted sums: `mini`, which is the sum of the smallest prices multiplied by the count of each fruit, and `maxi`, which is the sum of the largest prices multiplied by the count of each fruit. The function prints these two sums. If `m` is 0, both sums will be 0, but the function does not explicitly handle this edge case, so no additional output is generated in that scenario.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
