You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The spring is coming and it means that a lot of fruits appear on the counters. One sunny day little boy Valera decided to go shopping. He made a list of m fruits he wanted to buy. If Valera want to buy more than one fruit of some kind, he includes it into the list several times. 

When he came to the fruit stall of Ashot, he saw that the seller hadn't distributed price tags to the goods, but put all price tags on the counter. Later Ashot will attach every price tag to some kind of fruits, and Valera will be able to count the total price of all fruits from his list. But Valera wants to know now what can be the smallest total price (in case of the most «lucky» for him distribution of price tags) and the largest total price (in case of the most «unlucky» for him distribution of price tags).

Input

The first line of the input contains two integer number n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of price tags (which is equal to the number of different kinds of fruits that Ashot sells) and the number of items in Valera's list. The second line contains n space-separated positive integer numbers. Each of them doesn't exceed 100 and stands for the price of one fruit of some kind. The following m lines contain names of the fruits from the list. Each name is a non-empty string of small Latin letters which length doesn't exceed 32. It is guaranteed that the number of distinct fruits from the list is less of equal to n. Also it is known that the seller has in stock all fruits that Valera wants to buy.

Output

Print two numbers a and b (a ≤ b) — the minimum and the maximum possible sum which Valera may need to buy all fruits from his list.

Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
cs = sorted(list(map(int, raw_input().split())))
buy = dict()
for i in range(m):
    nf = raw_input()
    buy[nf] = buy.get(nf, 0) + 1
counts = sorted(list(buy.values()))
maxi = 0
mini = 0
for i in range(len(counts)):
    maxi += cs[-i - 1] * counts[-i - 1]
    mini += cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]
print('%d %d' % (mini, maxi))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
