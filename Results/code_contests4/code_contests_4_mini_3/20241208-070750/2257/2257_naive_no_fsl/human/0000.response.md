Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly calculates the minimum and maximum possible prices for the fruits Valera wants to buy. Specifically, the issue arises in how the program calculates the total costs. 

In the loop where the program computes the `maxi` and `mini` values:

```python
for i in range(len(counts)):
    maxi += cs[-i - 1] * counts[-i - 1]
    mini += cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]
```

The calculation for `maxi` is done correctly, as it multiplies the largest prices with the counts of the fruits. However, the calculation for `mini` is incorrect. It should multiply the smallest prices with the counts of the fruits, but it currently multiplies the `counts[-i - 1]` which corresponds to the largest counts with the smallest prices. 

To illustrate this with an example:

### Example Case:
Input:
```
5 3
4 2 1 10 5
apple
orange
mango
```

Expected Output:
- Minimum price: 7 (1 from one fruit, 2 from another, and 4 from the last)
- Maximum price: 19 (10 from one fruit, 5 from another, and 4 from the last)

However, the program will not compute these values correctly due to the logic flaw in the loop.

Thus, since the program fails to calculate the sum correctly for certain cases, the result is incorrect.
