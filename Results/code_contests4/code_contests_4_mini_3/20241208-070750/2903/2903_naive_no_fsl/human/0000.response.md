To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads two integers `n` (which is `w - 1`) and `k` (which is `l`), along with a list `a` that contains the number of stones at each distance from the bank.

2. **Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n - 1` (which corresponds to distances from `1` to `w - 1`).
   - For the first `k` distances, it sums the available stones directly into `s`.
   - After `k`, it adjusts the sum by subtracting the number of stones at the distance that is `k` units behind (to account for the fact that frogs can jump only `l` units).
   - `mn` is used to track the minimum number of stones used in any valid jump sequence.

3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the smaller value between `mn` and `s`.

### Analyzing Potential Edge Cases:

- **Case where `s` is never updated correctly**:
  - If there are no stones at all (i.e., `a` is all zeros), then `s` would remain `0`. This could lead to an incorrect answer if `mn` was not updated properly, as the frogs cannot jump if there are no stones.
  
- **Case where `a_i` is less than the number of frogs that can jump**:
  - For example, if `w = 10`, `l = 5`, and `a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the output should be `0`. The program might incorrectly yield a positive number if `mn` was not initialized or updated correctly.

- **Case with maximum input**:
  - When `w = 100000` and `l = 99999`, if the code does not handle the edge case of maximum input sizes well, it might run into performance issues or incorrect logic due to the assumptions in the loop.

### Conclusion:

Given these potential issues, especially regarding how `s` and `mn` are computed, and considering that the program does not explicitly handle cases with zero stones or initializes `mn` correctly, there are enough concerns to conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
