The program provided does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()` to read inputs, which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. Additionally, the way the input is being processed assumes that the first line contains two integers followed by a list of integers, but it tries to read all inputs in a single line.
  
2. **Variable Usage**: The program uses `n`, `k`, and `s` in a way that is not aligned with the problem statement. The variables should represent the width of the river (`w`), the maximum jump length of the frogs (`l`), and the list of stones available at each distance. Instead, it assumes `n` is the count of stones which is not consistent with the problem description.

3. **Logic Errors**: The logic used to calculate the number of frogs that can cross the river is flawed. The loop logic is not designed to keep track of how many frogs can jump across given the stones available and their respective distances. 

4. **Final Output**: The function prints the minimum value of `s` and `mn`, which does not correspond to the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river as required by the problem description. The program should calculate how many frogs can successfully reach the other side of the river using the stones, rather than just printing a calculated minimum.

### Conclusion:
Due to these discrepancies from the problem description, the function does not correctly solve the problem of determining the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river using the stones available. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
