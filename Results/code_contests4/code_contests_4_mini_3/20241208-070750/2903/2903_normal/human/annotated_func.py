#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is an integer representing the width of the river (1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5), l is an integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump (1 ≤ l < w), and a is a list of integers of length (w - 1) where each element a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4) represents the number of stones at the distance i from the bank.
def func():
    n, k, s, mn = map(int, raw_input().split() + [0, 10000000000])
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if i < k:
            s += a[i]
        else:
            mn = min(mn, s)
            s += a[i] - a[i - k]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the final computed value after processing the elements of list `a`, `mn` is the minimum value of `s` encountered during the loop execution, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `a` is the list of integers.
    print(min(mn, s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers representing the number of stones at different distances from the bank. It computes a value `s` that accumulates the number of stones for the first `k` distances and subsequently updates `s` by adding the stones at distance `i` and subtracting the stones at distance `i - k` for `i` from `k` to `n-2`. It keeps track of the minimum value of `s` encountered during this process and prints the smaller of this minimum value and the final computed `s`. The function does not directly evaluate the frog's ability to jump across the river; instead, it focuses on the number of stones available within the specified distance constraints.
