The value of `s` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is the value at index 0 of list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `i` is less than `k`, and `s` is incremented by `a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `i` is less than `k`, and `s` is incremented by `a[0]**
