According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, we must ensure that `i` is still less than `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
