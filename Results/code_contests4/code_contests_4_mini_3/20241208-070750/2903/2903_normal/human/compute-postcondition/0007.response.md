The value of `s` is incremented by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`. The values of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `s`. However, since `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, both `a[i]` and `a[i - k]` are valid accesses within the array. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `mn`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `s` without specific numeric values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is incremented by (a[i] - a[i - k]), and `mn` is the minimum value between `mn` and `s`.**
