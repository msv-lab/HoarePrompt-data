Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers representing the number of stones at different distances from the bank. It computes a value `s` that accumulates the number of stones for the first `k` distances and subsequently updates `s` by adding the stones at distance `i` and subtracting the stones at distance `i - k` for `i` from `k` to `n-2`. It keeps track of the minimum value of `s` encountered during this process and prints the smaller of this minimum value and the final computed `s`. The function does not directly evaluate the frog's ability to jump across the river; instead, it focuses on the number of stones available within the specified distance constraints. **
