The code attempts to assign the value of `mn` to the minimum of `mn` and `s`. However, since neither `mn` nor `s` are defined in the initial state, we cannot determine how `mn` will change or what value it will take. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and we cannot specify the operation involving `mn` and `s`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2; `mn` and `s` are not defined, so no change occurs.**
