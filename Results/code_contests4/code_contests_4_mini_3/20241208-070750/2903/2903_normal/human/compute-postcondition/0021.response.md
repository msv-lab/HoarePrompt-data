The function `func` accepts three parameters: `w`, `l`, and `a`. 

- `w` is an integer representing the width of the river, constrained such that \(1 \leq l < w \leq 10^5\).
- `l` is an integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump, with the constraint \(1 \leq l < w\).
- `a` is a list of integers of length \(w - 1\), where each element \(a_i\) (where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\)) represents the number of stones at the distance \(i\) from the bank.

The function's output is determined by evaluating the ability of a frog to jump across the river based on the provided parameters. The specific return value is not described in the prompt, so we will focus on the accepted parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `w` (an integer), `l` (an integer), and `a` (a list of integers), and evaluates the frog's ability to jump across the river based on these inputs.**
