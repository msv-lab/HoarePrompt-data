According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop is designed to run while `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again since `0 < n - 1`. 

After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making it 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which will still hold true if `n` is greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
