According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, as the range is defined as `range(0, n - 1)`, meaning that if `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute at all. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take the value of `0` during the first iteration. Since `mn` is initialized to `0` and `a` is a list of integers from input, these variables do not affect the execution of the loop itself in terms of its entry condition.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 1, and at the start of the first iteration, `i` will be `0`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0**
