The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. Since there is no output description provided, the functionality of the function is unclear based on the given information. 

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact functionality without additional context regarding the output of the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates under the constraints that a, b, and c are positive integers within the specified range. The specific output or behavior of the function is not described.**
