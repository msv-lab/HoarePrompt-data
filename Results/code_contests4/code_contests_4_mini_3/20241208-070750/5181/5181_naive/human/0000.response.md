To analyze the given program, we need to determine if it correctly calculates the maximum length of a good string based on the requirements of the problem description. 

The program provided is:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(a + b) + 2 * c
```

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Good String Definition**: A string is good if it consists only of 'a' and 'b' with no two consecutive letters being the same.
2. **Inputs**: 
   - `a`: Number of 'a' strings
   - `b`: Number of 'b' strings
   - `c`: Number of 'ab' strings
3. **Output**: The length of the longest good string you can obtain.

### Logic Analysis:
- Each 'ab' string contributes a length of 2.
- The remaining 'a' and 'b' strings can be used to alternate, contributing a combined length of `a + b`.

### Expected Calculation:
The maximum length of the good string should be:
- Length from 'ab' strings: `2 * c`
- Length from 'a' and 'b' strings: `a + b`

The total length should be calculated as:  
`total_length = (a + b) + 2 * c`

### Issues with the Provided Program:
The provided program incorrectly uses parentheses which might lead to an unexpected output. The correct interpretation of the provided code is:
```python
print((a + b) + 2 * c)
```
However, if we assume the original intent was to print the total length correctly, we need to check if the logic holds under various inputs.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: 
   - For `1 1 1`, the expected maximum length is `1 + 1 + 2 * 1 = 4`. The program outputs `4`, which is correct.
2. **Large Values**: 
   - For `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the expected output is `1000000000 + 1000000000 + 2 * 1000000000 = 4000000000`. The program outputs `4000000000`, which is again correct.
3. **Imbalanced Values**: 
   - For `0 0 1`, the expected output is `0 + 0 + 2 * 1 = 2`. However, since `0` is not a valid input according to the constraints (1 â‰¤ a, b, c), this case is not applicable.
4. **General Case**: 
   - For `3 5 2`, the expected output is `3 + 5 + 2 * 2 = 12`. The program outputs `12`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly calculates the maximum length of the good string in all tested cases based on the problem description, we conclude that it is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
