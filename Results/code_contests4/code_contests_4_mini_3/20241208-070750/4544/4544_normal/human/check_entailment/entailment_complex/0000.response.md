Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the explanation of how the program correctly implements the functionality specified:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using a function `readline`, which is assumed to provide the input in the specified format. It correctly handles `n` participants by iterating `n` times.

2. **Data Processing**: For each participant, the program reads their participant number (`a`) and the number of fish caught (`v`). The program correctly processes this data in a loop.

3. **Finding the Winner**: The program maintains two variables, `value` and `number`, to keep track of the maximum number of fish caught and the corresponding participant number. 
   - It checks if the current participant's catch `v` is greater than the current `value` (maximum fish caught so far). If it is, it updates both `value` and `number` to reflect the new maximum.
   - If the catch is equal to the current maximum (`value`), it checks if the current participant's number `a` is less than the stored `number`. This ensures that in cases of a tie (multiple participants catching the same maximum number of fish), the program selects the participant with the lowest number.

4. **Output**: After processing all participants, the program prints the participant number with the maximum catch and the catch itself as specified in the output format.

5. **Constraints Compliance**: The program correctly adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description (1 ≤ n ≤ 20, 0 ≤ vi ≤ 100, and participant numbers are distinct integers between 1 and n).

Overall, the program correctly identifies the participant who caught the most fish and handles ties appropriately, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as True.
