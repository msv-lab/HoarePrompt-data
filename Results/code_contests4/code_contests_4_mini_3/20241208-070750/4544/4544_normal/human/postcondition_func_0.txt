The function accepts a function `readline` that provides input for participant numbers and the number of fish caught by each participant. It determines the participant who caught the maximum number of fish, returning their participant number and the corresponding catch. In case of a tie in the number of fish caught, it selects the participant with the lower participant number. The function does not return any values but prints the result and exits.
