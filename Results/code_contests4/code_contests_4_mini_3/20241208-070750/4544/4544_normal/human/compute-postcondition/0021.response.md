The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `readline`, which is expected to provide input values. The expected input includes an integer `n` that falls between 1 and 20, followed by a series of distinct integers `ai` that represent participant numbers, and integers `vi` that indicate the number of fish caught by each participant `ai`. After processing the input, the function returns the participant number who caught the maximum number of fish. If there is a tie, it returns the participant with the lower number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept input regarding participant numbers and their corresponding catch counts and return the participant number who has caught the most fish, resolving ties by selecting the participant with the lower number.

Functionality: **The function accepts input values for participant numbers and the number of fish caught, returning the participant number who caught the maximum number of fish, resolving ties by selecting the lower participant number.**
