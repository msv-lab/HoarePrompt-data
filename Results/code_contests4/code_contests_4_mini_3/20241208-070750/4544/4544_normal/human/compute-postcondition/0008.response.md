According to the code, the loop is controlled by the integer returned from `readline()`, which indicates how many times the loop should execute. The loop has already executed once, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 20. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `n` is valid and allows for future iterations. Since the loop executes for the range of `int(readline())`, the loop can continue if `int(readline())` is greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred. 

If the loop has executed once, it implies that there is still at least one iteration remaining (if `n` is greater than 1). For the loop to execute one more time, the value returned by `readline()` must still be valid, meaning it should be greater than the number of times the loop has already executed.

Considering these points, the next state would need to reflect the fact that the loop has executed once and will execute again if `n` remains greater than the current number of iterations plus one.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
