The command `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately without changing any variable states or returning any values. Therefore, the values of `n`, `value`, and `number` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20; `value` is the maximum number of fish caught among all participants; `number` is the participant number associated with that maximum catch; and the program exits without changes.**
