According to the code, the loop iterates a number of times equal to the integer value read from `readline()`. The loop will execute again for each iteration as long as the integer value read is greater than the current iteration count. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 20, and we need to determine the current iteration count, which is represented by `_`. 

Assuming the loop has executed up to its current iteration count `_`, for the loop to execute one more time, the value read from `readline()` must be greater than `_`. If the last execution count was `_`, the next iteration would be `_ + 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least `_ + 1`, and `_` would be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be at least `_ + 1`**
