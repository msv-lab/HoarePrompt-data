The variable `arr` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))`, where `raw_input()` accepts a string input, `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace, `split(' ')` splits the input string into a list of substrings based on spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts each substring to an integer. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers and do not directly affect the state of `arr`, the output state will reflect that `arr` has been assigned a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from the input**
