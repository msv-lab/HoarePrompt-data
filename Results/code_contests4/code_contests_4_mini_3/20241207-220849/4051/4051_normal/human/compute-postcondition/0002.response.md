The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly as per the provided signature. However, it operates on two variables `n` and `k`, which are positive integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^14. The output of the function is a list of integers derived from an internal variable 'arr'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to return a list of integers derived from 'arr', based on the internal logic that utilizes the positive integers `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of integers derived from 'arr'.**
