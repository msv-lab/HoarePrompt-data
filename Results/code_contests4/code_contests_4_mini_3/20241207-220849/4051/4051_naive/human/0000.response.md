To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

**Problem description:**
We need to find the number of ways to choose two toys such that their costs add up to `k`, where the cost of the i-th toy is `i` burles. The constraints specify that a pair (a, b) is considered equal to (b, a) and a pair (a, a) is not allowed.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1():
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))
    return arr

(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
if n >= k:
    x = k - 1
    print(max(0, x // 2))
else:
    l = k - n
    l = n - l + 1
    print(max(0, l // 2))
```

1. **Input Handling:**
   The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`. 

2. **Logic for Pairs:**
   - The first condition checks if `n >= k`. This is important because if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, you might have pairs that could potentially sum to `k` using values from 1 to `n`.
   - If `n >= k`, the program computes `x = k - 1`, and then it outputs `max(0, x // 2)`. This logic is flawed because it does not properly account for the requirement that pairs must be distinct and their sum must equal `k`.
   - If `n < k`, the program computes `l = k - n`, then derives `l = n - l + 1` which does not logically follow the requirement of finding distinct pairs summing to `k`.

3. **Missing Cases in Logic:**
   - The case where `k` is even and both toys must add to `k` is not addressed correctly. For example, if `k = 10` and `n = 8`, valid pairs would be (2, 8), (3, 7), and (4, 6), but this logic does not capture that.
   - The logic for counting pairs fails in scenarios where `k` is larger than `n`, resulting in incorrect outputs as it does not properly count valid pairs based on their distinct costs.

**Test Cases Demonstrating Flaws:**
1. For `n = 8` and `k = 10`, the valid pairs are (2, 8), (3, 7), and (4, 6). The program will return `max(0, (10-1)//2) = max(0, 4) = 4`, which is incorrect.
2. For `n = 7` and `k = 20`, the program will output 0, which is correct, but it fails in other scenarios.

Given that the logic fails to correctly count the pairs for inputs where `n` and `k` interact in a manner that produces valid pairs, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
