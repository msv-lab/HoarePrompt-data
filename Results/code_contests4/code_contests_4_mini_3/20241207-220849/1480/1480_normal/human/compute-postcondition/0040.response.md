The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `x`. All three parameters are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. The function does not return any specific output described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept three integers `a`, `b`, and `x` that meet the given constraints, but the expected output or behavior of the function is not detailed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a, b, and x, which are integers constrained by 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. The specific output or behavior of the function is not provided.**
