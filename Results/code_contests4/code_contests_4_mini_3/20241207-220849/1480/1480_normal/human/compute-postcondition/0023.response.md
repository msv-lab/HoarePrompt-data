The value of `x` is decremented by 1. However, the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `s` are not specified, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is decreased by 1. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is decreased by 1**
