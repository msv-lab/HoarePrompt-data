After analyzing the provided code and the initial state, we have:

1. The variable `s` has a length equal to `x - 1`, which means `s` currently has a length of `1 - 1 = 0`. 
2. The last character of `s` is '1', which means `s` must originally have been '1' before this code is executed.
3. The code `s += '0' * a` means we are appending '0' repeated `a` times to the end of `s`.
4. Since `a` is decremented by the number of times `s` ended with '1', and initially `s` is '1', `a` will be decremented by 1.

Now let's summarize the impacts:

- Initially: `s` is '1', `a` is decremented by 1 (let's denote the original value of `a` as `a_original`). So now, `a` becomes `a_original - 1`.
- The new value of `s` will be `s + '0' * (a_original - 1)`, which means `s` becomes '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's.

Considering all of this, the output state will include the new values of `s` and `a`.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `a` is `a_original - 1`, `s` is '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's**
