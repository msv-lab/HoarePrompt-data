The value of `b` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `b` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact new value after the operation. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is equal to 1, `b` has been decremented by 1 (but its exact value is unknown), `x` is greater than 1, and `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 1, `b` has been decremented by 1, `x` is greater than 1, `s` is '1'**
