The value of `a` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `a` is unknown. The values of `b` and `x` remain unchanged, and `s` remains concatenated with '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is decreased by 1; `b` is an integer; `x` is an integer; `s` is concatenated with '0'.

Output State: **`a` is decreased by 1; `b` is an integer; `x` is an integer; `s` is concatenated with '0'**
