The value of `b` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `b` is unknown. The values of `a`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is decreased by 1, `x` is an integer, and `s` is the previous value of `s` concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is decreased by 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is the previous value of `s` concatenated with '1'**
