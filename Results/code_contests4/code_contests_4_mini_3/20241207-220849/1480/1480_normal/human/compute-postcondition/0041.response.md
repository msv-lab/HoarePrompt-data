Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `x`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ x < a + b`. It constructs a binary string `s` of length `x` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `x`. The string alternates between '1's and '0's, starting with '1' if certain conditions are met, and appending remaining '1's or '0's based on the counts of `a` and `b` after the loop. Finally, the constructed string `s` is printed. The function does not return any value. **
