The value of `b` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `b` is unknown, but it will now hold a value that is one less than its previous value. The states of `a`, `s`, and `x` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer decreased by 1, `s` is increased by '1', and `x` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer decreased by 1, `s` is increased by '1', and `x` is greater than 2**
