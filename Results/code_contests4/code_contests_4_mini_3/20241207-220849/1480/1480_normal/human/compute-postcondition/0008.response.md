According to the code, the loop can execute if `x` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, we know that `x` is an integer. For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be greater than 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is set to a value greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as `a`, `b`, and `s` do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers, for the loop to execute the first time then `x` must be greater than 1**
