According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must have been greater than 2 before it was decreased, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 2**
