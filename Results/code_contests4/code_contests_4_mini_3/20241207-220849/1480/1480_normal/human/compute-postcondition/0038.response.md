Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, if `s` ends with '0', then `a` is decremented by the number of times `s` ended with '1' and `b` is decremented by the number of times `s` ended with '0', resulting in `s` being an empty string. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by 1 (i.e., `a` becomes `a_original - 1`), and `s` is updated to '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's followed by `b` number of '1's.***
