The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are assigned new integer values from the input, which are read and split into three variables. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are unknown, but they are all integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, after execution, the output state will reflect the new values of `a`, `b`, and `x` as integers based on the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers based on input values**
