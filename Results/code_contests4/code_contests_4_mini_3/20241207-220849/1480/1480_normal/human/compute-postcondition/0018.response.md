The code appends the string '1' to the variable `s`. The initial state does not provide a value for `s`, but we know that `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers, and `x` needs to be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers; `s` is now the previous value of `s` concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers; `s` is now the previous value of `s` concatenated with '1'**
