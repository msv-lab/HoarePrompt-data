In the code, `s` is a string that currently holds '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's. The operation `s += '1' * b` appends `b` number of '1's to the end of the string `s`. The previous value of `s` is '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's, so after the operation, `s` will contain '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's followed by `b` number of '1's.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1, `a` is `a_original - 1`, `s` is '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's followed by `b` number of '1's.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `a` is `a_original - 1`, `s` is '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's followed by `b` number of '1's**.
