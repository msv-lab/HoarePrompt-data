Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers. If `s[-1]` is '0', then `b` is decreased by 1, `s` is increased by '1', and `x` remains greater than 2. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by 1, `b` remains an integer, `s` is updated by appending '0', and for the loop to execute again, `x` is greater than 2.***
