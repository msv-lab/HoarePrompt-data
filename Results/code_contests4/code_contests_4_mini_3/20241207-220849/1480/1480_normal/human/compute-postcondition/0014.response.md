The value of `a` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `a` is unknown. The values of `b` and `x` remain unchanged, and `s` does not get affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is decreased by 1, `b` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, and `s` is now `s` concatenated with '0'.

Output State: **`a` is decreased by 1, `b` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, and `s` is now `s` concatenated with '0'.**
