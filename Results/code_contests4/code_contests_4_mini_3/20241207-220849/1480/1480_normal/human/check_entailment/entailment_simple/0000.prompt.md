You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given three integers a, b and x. Your task is to construct a binary string s of length n = a + b such that there are exactly a zeroes, exactly b ones and exactly x indices i (where 1 ≤ i < n) such that s_i ≠ s_{i + 1}. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

For example, for the string "01010" there are four indices i such that 1 ≤ i < n and s_i ≠ s_{i + 1} (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). For the string "111001" there are two such indices i (i = 3, 5).

Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and x (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ x < a + b).

Output

Print only one string s, where s is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

Examples

Input

2 2 1


Output

1100


Input

3 3 3


Output

101100


Input

5 3 6


Output

01010100

Note

All possible answers for the first example: 

  * 1100; 
  * 0011. 



All possible answers for the second example: 

  * 110100; 
  * 101100; 
  * 110010; 
  * 100110; 
  * 011001; 
  * 001101; 
  * 010011; 
  * 001011. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b.
def func():
    a, b, x = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    if (x > 1 and a == 1) :
        s = '1'
        b -= 1
    else :
        s = '0'
        a -= 1
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers. If `x` is greater than 1 and `a` is equal to 1, then `b` has been decremented by 1 and `s` is '1'. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by 1, `b` remains an integer, `x` remains an integer, and `s` is '0'.
    while x > 1:
        if s[-1] == '0':
            s += '1'
            b -= 1
        else:
            s += '0'
            a -= 1
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is 1, `a` is decremented by the number of times `s` ended with '1', `b` is decremented by the number of times `s` ended with '0', `s` will have a length equal to the initial value of `x` minus 1, and `a` and `b` remain integers.
    if (s[-1] == '0') :
        s += '1' * b
        s += '0' * a
    else :
        s += '0' * a
        s += '1' * b
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is 1, if `s` ends with '0', then `a` is decremented by the number of times `s` ended with '1' and `b` is decremented by the number of times `s` ended with '0', resulting in `s` being an empty string. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by 1 (i.e., `a` becomes `a_original - 1`), and `s` is updated to '1' followed by `a_original - 1` number of '0's followed by `b` number of '1's.
    print(s)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
