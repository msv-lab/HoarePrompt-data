To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that the logic implemented correctly computes the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage, given the constraints.

The key points of the problem are:
1. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or the next day.
2. Each bag can contain up to `k` units of garbage.
3. We need to minimize the number of bags used.

The program has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- `func_1(a, k)` computes the number of bags required for a list of garbage units. It keeps track of any leftover garbage (carry) from the previous day and calculates how many bags are needed for the current day's garbage. If there's any leftover garbage, it tries to fit it into a new bag.
- `func_2()` reads input and calls `func_1` twice: once with the original list of garbage units and once with the reverse of that list. It returns the minimum number of bags required from both computations.

To determine correctness, we must check edge cases that might not be handled by the program. 

### Potential Issue

1. **Carry Handling**: The carry (leftover from the previous day) is added to the current day's garbage. If the carry is equal to `k`, it should not create an extra bag but rather fill up an existing one. The logic needs to ensure that when `carry` is maximized, it doesn't lead to an extra bag unnecessarily.

2. **Zero Garbage**: If a day has `0` units of garbage, the carry should not affect the calculation of bags for the next day. However, the current implementation does not clearly handle the scenario where the carry is `0` and the next day has more units than `k`. 

3. **Multiple Days with Zero Garbage**: If there are multiple consecutive days where the amount of garbage is `0`, the function should not erroneously count bags for those days.

### Example Input for Testing
Consider the input: 

```
3 3
3 0 3
```

Expected output: **2** (one bag for day 1, one bag for day 3).

However, using the current logic:
- Day 1 produces `3`, so it needs `1` bag.
- Day 2 has `0`, so it carries `0`.
- Day 3 produces `3`, so it needs `1` bag.

Thus, it correctly computes `2`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the logic and considering various edge cases, including the handling of carry and zero garbage days, the current implementation seems to handle the requirements as specified in the problem description correctly. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**.
