To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify any potential edge cases that the program may not handle correctly.

### Problem Breakdown:
- Vasya produces a certain amount of garbage each day.
- Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it is produced or the next day.
- Each bag can hold a maximum of `k` units.
- The goal is to minimize the number of bags used.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, k)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of bags needed to dispose of the garbage described in list `a`, where each bag can hold `k` units.
   - The logic appears to take into account any leftover garbage (`carry`) from the previous day when calculating bags for the current day.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input values and calls `func_1` twice: once on the input list and once on the reversed list. It then prints the minimum of the two results.
   - The purpose of reversing the list is to account for the possibility of carrying over garbage from one day to the next in a more optimal way.

### Potential Edge Case:
- Consider the case where `k` is very large compared to the amounts of garbage produced. For instance:
  - Input: `4 100`
  - Garbage amounts: `1 2 3 4`
  
  In this situation, all garbage can fit into one bag since `k` is much larger than any daily garbage amount. However, if we calculate it based on the logic used, it may lead to incorrect assumptions about how many bags are needed based on the carry logic.

- Another edge case could be:
  - Input: `3 1`
  - Garbage amounts: `1 1 1`
  
  In this case, the number of bags needed should exactly equal the number of garbage units since each unit fits in a separate bag. The logic should ensure that it does not overestimate the number of bags due to carries.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the logic and the potential edge cases, it seems that the code does not correctly account for certain scenarios, especially in the way it handles `carry` and the optimal usage of bags when `k` is significantly larger than the daily garbage units.

Correctness: **False**

The program may fail in cases where the carry from one day leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of bags needed, particularly when the garbage produced is minimal compared to `k`.
