The function accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers representing the units of garbage produced over several days and a positive integer `k` representing the capacity of each bag. It calculates the total number of bags required to handle the garbage, taking into account any leftover garbage that doesn't fill an entire bag, and adds an extra bag if there is any leftover after processing all days. The function will return the total number of bags needed, which includes an additional bag if there is any leftover garbage remaining after the last day.
