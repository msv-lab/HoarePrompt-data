The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates with external constraints: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of days, `k` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each bag, and `a_i` is a list of non-negative integers representing the units of garbage produced on each day.

The function processes the garbage produced over `n` days and determines how many bags are needed based on the capacity `k` of each bag. The output of the function is the total number of bags required to accommodate the garbage produced over the specified days.

Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the total number of bags required to accommodate the garbage produced over `n` days, given the capacity `k` of each bag.**
