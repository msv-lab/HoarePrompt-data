The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `k`. Parameter `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the units of garbage produced for each of the n days, and parameter `k` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each bag. The length of the list `a` is equal to n, where 1 <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. After executing the function body, the program returns the total number of bags formed from all elements of `a`, increased by 1 due to 'carry' not being equal to 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `k`, and return the total number of bags required to carry the garbage produced over n days, accounting for any leftover garbage that does not fit into a full bag. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `k`, returning the total number of bags formed from the garbage produced, increased by 1 if there is any leftover garbage.**
