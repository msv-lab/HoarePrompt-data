The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values (which are space-separated integers) to integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected. The values of `k` and `_` are also unchanged, as they are not utilized in this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `k` is the second input value; `_` is the first input value (not used further); `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
