The variables `_` and `k` are assigned values based on the input provided by the user. The variable `k` is specifically updated with the second value from the input, while `_` is assigned the first value, which is not used further. The variable `n` remains unchanged and retains its previous value, which is a positive integer within the specified range. The values of other variables, including the list `a_i`, are also not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `k` is the second input value; `_` is the first input value (not used further).**
