To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. For each of the next n days, Vasya produces `a_i` units of garbage.
2. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of on the day it was produced or the next day.
3. Each bag can hold up to `k` units of garbage.
4. The goal is to compute the minimum number of bags needed to dispose of all the garbage without leaving any after the n-th day.

### Analysis of the Program:

#### Function `func_1(a, k)`:
- The function initializes `bags` (to count total bags used) and `carry` (to keep track of leftover garbage that cannot fill a bag).
- It iterates through the list `a` which contains the number of units of garbage produced each day.
- If there is any leftover garbage (`carry`), it adds one bag to the count and tries to reduce the current day's garbage `i` by this carry.
- It calculates the number of bags needed for the current day's garbage using `i // k` and updates the carry for the next day using `i % k`.
- After processing all days, if there is any remaining `carry`, it adds one more bag for that.

##### Key Points:
- The function ensures that garbage produced on day `i` can either be disposed of that day or handled the next day, which aligns with the problem's requirement.
- The function correctly computes the number of bags needed for both current and leftover garbage.
  
#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function reads the input values for `n` and `k`, and the list `a`.
- It calls `func_1` twice: once with `a` as is and once with `a` reversed (`a[::-1]`), and prints the minimum of the two results.

##### Key Points:
- By checking both the original and reversed order of garbage disposal, the function attempts to minimize the number of bags used.
- This approach is valid because it allows for optimizing the disposal strategy by considering the carry from previous days in both directions.

### Conclusion:
Both functions appear to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The first function processes the garbage and calculates the number of bags needed, and the second function evaluates both possible disposal orders to ensure the minimum number of bags is used.

### Final Verdict:
The program does meet the stated problem requirements for all potential cases given the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
