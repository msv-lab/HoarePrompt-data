To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the implementation and the annotations closely.

### Understanding the Problem Description:
Vasya needs to dispose of garbage produced over `n` days, using bags that can hold up to `k` units of garbage. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of on the day it was produced or the next day, without any garbage left after the last day. The goal is to minimize the number of bags used.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Function `func_1(a, k)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of bags needed based on the garbage produced each day (`a`) and the capacity of the bags (`k`).
   - It tracks any leftover garbage (`carry`) from one day to the next.
   - The core logic seems to handle the garbage disposal correctly, accounting for the total garbage on each day and the carry from the previous day.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input values and calls `func_1` twice: once with the original order of garbage amounts and once with the reversed order.
   - It prints the minimum of the two results.

### Validating Edge Cases:
- The program should correctly handle cases with:
  - All zeros in the garbage list (should return 0 bags needed).
  - Large values of garbage produced on each day (up to 1 billion).
  - Situations where the garbage produced exceeds the capacity of a bag.

### Potential Cases:
1. **Carry Overs**: The handling of `carry` in `func_1` needs to ensure that if there is leftover garbage from day `i`, it is adequately accounted for on day `i+1`.
2. **Garbage Distribution**: The algorithm's reliance on reversing the list in `func_2` could potentially cause issues in certain edge cases. Specifically, if there is a large amount of garbage on one day followed by a small amount, reversing the list could lead to miscalculating the number of bags needed.

### Example Tests:
- Consider the input: 
  ```
  3 2
  3 2 1
  ```
  - Expected output is `3` (1 bag for day 1 (2 + 1 carry), 1 bag for day 2, 1 bag for day 3).
  
- If we input:
  ```
  3 2
  1 0 1
  ```
  - Expected output is `2` since we need one bag for day 1 and one bag for day 3.

### Conclusion:
While the implementation appears to work for many simple cases, the handling of the "carry" and the approach of checking both the original and reversed lists raises concerns. Specifically, the logic of reversing the list could overlook situations where bags from previous days are not fully utilized due to the order of garbage production.

### Final Verdict:
After careful consideration, we can identify that the combination of the reversed order and the handling of `carry` may lead to incorrect outputs in specific scenarios, particularly when the distribution of garbage varies significantly day-to-day.

Thus, the final evaluation of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
