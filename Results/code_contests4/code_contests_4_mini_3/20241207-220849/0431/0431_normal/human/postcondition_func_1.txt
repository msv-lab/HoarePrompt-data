The function accepts two parameters: a list of non-negative integers representing the units of garbage produced over `n` days and a positive integer `k` representing the capacity of each bag. It calculates the total number of bags required to accommodate the garbage over the days, considering both the original order of days and the reverse order, and returns the minimum number of bags needed. Note that the function assumes that the helper function `func_1` is correctly implemented to calculate the number of bags for the given list of garbage and bag capacity.
