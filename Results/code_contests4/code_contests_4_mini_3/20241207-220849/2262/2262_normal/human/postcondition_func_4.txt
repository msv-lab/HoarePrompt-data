The function processes a grid of characters ('X' and '.') for multiple test cases, converting specific 'X' characters to 'O' based on a calculated value. It aims to ensure that the counts of 'X' are distributed evenly across three categories derived from their indices, while ensuring at least one category has no 'X's. The output is the modified grid printed as strings, but the function does not handle cases where the grid is entirely empty or consists only of 'O' characters.
