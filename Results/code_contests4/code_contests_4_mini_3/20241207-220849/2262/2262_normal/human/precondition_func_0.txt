t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), n is an integer representing the size of the grid (1 ≤ n ≤ 300), and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each containing n characters, where each character is either '.' or 'X'. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
