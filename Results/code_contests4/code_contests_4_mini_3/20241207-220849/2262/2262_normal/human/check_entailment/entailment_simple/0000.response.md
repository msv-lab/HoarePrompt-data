Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases, but `func_2()` and `func_3()` do not correctly handle the grid input as they are not integrated into the test case reading and processing logic properly. The input for each grid is not being read and stored in a structured way.

2. **Logic for Winning Configuration**: The program does not check for winning configurations ("three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column") as per the problem description. Instead, it only counts occurrences of 'X' and 'O' and attempts to change them without verifying if any row or column actually has three consecutive tokens before or after the modifications. 

3. **Changing Tokens**: The program does not enforce the condition of changing tokens to ensure that there are no three consecutive tokens. It just attempts to change 'X' tokens to 'O' based on the `use_clr` variable, but it does not guarantee that the result will lead to a draw configuration as specified.

4. **Output Formatting**: The output of the function should reflect the entire grid after processing all test cases, which is not guaranteed to be structured or complete based on the current implementation.

In conclusion, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to ensure that the resulting grid configuration meets the requirement of being a draw. It does not properly track and modify the grid based on the winning conditions specified in the problem description.
