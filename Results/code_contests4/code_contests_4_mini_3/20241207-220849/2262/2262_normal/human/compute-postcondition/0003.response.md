According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), the loop will execute at least once. The state of `t`, `M`, and `k` does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but we can note their initial values.

At the beginning of the first iteration, the loop variable (which is represented by `_` in this case) will be initialized to 0. Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure the following:
- `t` is a positive integer (which it is, as per the given state).
- `M` is an empty list (which is as given).
- `k` is initialized to 0 (which it is).
- The loop variable `_` will be 0 during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `M` is an empty list, `k` is 0, loop variable `_` is 0 for the first iteration**
