Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` called `n` times, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements in `M`, `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0), if `M[i][j]` is equal to 'X', then `clr` is set to {(i, j): (i + j) % 3}, `cnt` is updated to [1, 0, 0], while if `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X', then `clr` is set to {(i, j): -1}, and `cnt` remains [0, 0, 0].***
