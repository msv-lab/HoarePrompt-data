Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is equal to `n`, `clr[i, j]` has been assigned the value based on the condition of `M[i][j]`, and `cnt` holds the counts of occurrences of 'X' for the indices determined by `(i + j) % 3` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
