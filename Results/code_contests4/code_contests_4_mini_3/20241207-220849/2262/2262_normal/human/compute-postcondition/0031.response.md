The code increments the value at the index `(i + j) % 3` of the list `cnt` by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `j` incremented by 1 and `clr[i, j]` calculated as `(i + j) % 3`. Therefore, the exact index for `cnt` depends on the values of `i` and the newly incremented value of `j`.

Since `cnt` is being modified, we assume it was properly initialized before this operation. The output state reflects that the value at the specific index in `cnt` is incremented, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` is a list containing return values from `func_3()` called `n` times, `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100], `j` is now incremented by 1, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
