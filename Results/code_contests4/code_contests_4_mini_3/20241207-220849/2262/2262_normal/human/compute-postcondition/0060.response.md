The value of `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` is 0 and `j` is `n - 1`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 300. Therefore, after execution, `clr[0, n - 1]` is set to `-1`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `M[i][j]`) are not directly affected, but we note that the loop can execute under the given conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and `clr[0, n - 1]` is -1.**
