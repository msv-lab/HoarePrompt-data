`cnt` is assigned a list containing three zeros, which initializes it to `[0, 0, 0]`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` called `n` times, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements in `M`, `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0), `clr` is an empty dictionary, and `cnt` is [0, 0, 0].

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` called `n` times, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements in `M`, `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0), `clr` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is [0, 0, 0]**
