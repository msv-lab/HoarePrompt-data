According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `j` is currently `n`, for the next iteration, `j` will be `n + 1`, which exceeds the upper limit of the loop condition (which is `n`). Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than n, but j is currently n**.
