According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since it is stated that `i` is currently equal to `n`, this implies that `j` is also equal to `n` at this point. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to `n - 1` (the maximum value it can take before the loop ends) and `n` remains positive.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), for the loop to execute a second time `j` is now `n - 1`**
