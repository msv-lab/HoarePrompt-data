The code snippet `clr[i, j] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the position `clr[i, j]`. The variables `t` and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `j` is equal to `n`. The specific values of `i` and `j` are not provided, hence we cannot determine the exact index being modified in `clr`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `t` and `n`, while noting that `j` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is `n`, and `clr[i, j]` is set to -1**.
