The function `func_5` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates based on the constraints provided for multiple test cases. The function processes a grid for each test case, where the grid size `n` is defined by the number of strings, each containing `n` characters which can either be '.' or 'X'. 

The output is not directly stated in the provided information, but it can be inferred that the function evaluates the grid and returns some result based on the configuration of the characters in the grid.

Given that the function processes multiple test cases with varying grid sizes, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases of grids defined by strings of characters, returning a result based on the configuration of '.' and 'X' characters. Each test case grid is of size n x n, where n is a positive integer.**
