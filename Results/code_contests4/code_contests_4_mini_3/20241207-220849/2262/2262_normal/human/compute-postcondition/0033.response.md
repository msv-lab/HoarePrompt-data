Postcondition: ***`M` is a list containing return values from `func_3()` called `n` times, `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100], and `j` is incremented by 1. If `M[i][j]` equals 'X', then `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains as `j + 1` and `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value -1.***
