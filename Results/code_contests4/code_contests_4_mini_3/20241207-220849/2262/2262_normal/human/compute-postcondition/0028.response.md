Postcondition: ***`M` is a list containing return values from `func_3()` called `n` times, `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100], and `n` is greater than `j + 1`. If `M[i][j]` is 'X', then `clr` is updated with the value (i + j) % 3, and `cnt` is incremented at the index corresponding to (i + j) % 3. Otherwise, `clr` is updated to {(i, j): -1}, while `cnt` remains unchanged.***
