Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is a list containing 'O' at all positions where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O', `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0), `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are less than or equal to `K` and at least one of them is equal to 0, `use_clr` is equal to 3, `chg` is the total count of assignments made to 'O', `i` is `n-1`; the output is the concatenation of the elements in `M` for all indices from 0 to `n-1`.**
