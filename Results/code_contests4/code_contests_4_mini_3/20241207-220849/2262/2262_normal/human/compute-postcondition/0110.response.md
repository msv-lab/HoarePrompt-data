`chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `chg` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **variable `chg` is increased by 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O'.**
