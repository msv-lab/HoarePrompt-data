Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `M` is a list where `M[i][j]` is 'O' for all `j` where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`, `chg` is the total count of assignments made to 'O' for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is incremented by the total number of loop executions, and `j` is equal to `n`.**
