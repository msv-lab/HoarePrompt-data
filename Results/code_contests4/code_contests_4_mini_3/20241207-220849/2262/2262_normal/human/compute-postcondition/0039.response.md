The code increments the value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` by 1. The value of `i` and `j` are not specified, but `j` is equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, `i + j` can be expressed as `i + (n - 1)`, which gives `(i + n - 1) % 3`. The specific value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is unknown since `cnt` is not initialized, but it is incremented by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is increased by 1, where `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**
