According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. Since `j` starts at `n` and the loop iterates while `j` is less than `n`, it will not execute again if `j` is equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, which means the loop will not execute a second time unless `j` is incremented. Since `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration in `xrange(n)`, it will be `n + 1` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, since `j` is currently `n`, it will need to be incremented to `n + 1`, and `n` must remain the same. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is `n + 1` for the loop to execute a second time `n` must remain the same.**
