The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `j`, and `M[i][j]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1**
