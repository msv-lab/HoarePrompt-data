According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than the current loop variable `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300). For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. After the current iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1.

So, after the first iteration, `_` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `M` is a list containing the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is equal to the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`, loop variable `_` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
