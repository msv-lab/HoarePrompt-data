The variable `k` is incremented by the sum of 1 for each occurrence of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of the list `M`, which is `M[-1]`. The previous value of `k` is equal to the count of 'X' and 'O' in the list `M` before this operation. Since `M[-1]` has an additional value appended from `func_3()`, the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]` adds to the previous value of `k`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `k` based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`, while `t`, `n`, and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `M` is a list containing the return value of `func_3()` with an additional value appended, `k` is updated to include the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`**.
