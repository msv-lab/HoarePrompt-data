According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the loop variable (in this case, the underscore `_`) is less than `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), and at the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, we do not have the exact value of the loop variable, but we know that it has been incremented by 1 from its previous state. Therefore, if the last iteration was the k-th iteration, the next iteration will be the (k+1)-th iteration.

Since `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) and `M` is updated with the return value of `func_3()` with an additional value appended, we do not need to modify these variables unless specified in the loop body. 

Thus, the loop can execute one more time if `n` is greater than the value of the loop variable after this last iteration. If the loop variable was `k` at the end of the last iteration, then for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `k`.

Assuming that the loop variable has been incremented to `k + 1`, we state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than `k + 1`, `M` is a list containing the return value of `func_3()` with an additional value appended, `k` is updated to include the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]**
