According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, meaning it is currently equal to the upper limit of the loop range. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become `n`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`, which is not the case since `j` equals `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is n, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than n**
