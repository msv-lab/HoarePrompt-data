The assignment `M[i][j] = 'O'` sets the element at the position `[i][j]` of the list `M` to the string 'O'. The previous state indicates that `i` has been incremented by 1 and that it is still less than `n`, which is greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, the assignment is valid, and it will affect the specific position in the list `M`.

The variable `chg`, which counts the total assignments made to 'O', will be incremented by 1 due to this assignment. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the changes made to `M`, `chg`, `i`, and `j`:

- `M[i][j]` is now 'O'.
- `chg` is increased by 1.
- `i` is still `i + 1`.
- `j` is 0.

Output State: **`M[i][j]` is 'O', `chg` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 0**.
