According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the last value it took, which is `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n`, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), the loop cannot execute again because `i` is no longer less than `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n`, but since `i` is now equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again.**
