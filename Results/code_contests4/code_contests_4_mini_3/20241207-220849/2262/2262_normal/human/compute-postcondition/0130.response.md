Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0, `M` is a list containing 'O' at all positions where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O', `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0), `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are less than or equal to `K` and at least one of them is equal to 0, `use_clr` is equal to 3, `chg` is the total count of assignments made to 'O', `i` is 0; the output is the concatenated string of `M[i]`.**
