The variable `cnt` at index `(i + j) % 3` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `cnt` are not provided, thus we cannot determine the exact new value at that index, but we know that it increases by 1. The values of `i` and `j` are also not specified, so we cannot determine their specific contributions to the calculation. Therefore, the output state is: `clr` is updated with the value (i + j) % 3, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`clr` is updated with the value (i + j) % 3, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
