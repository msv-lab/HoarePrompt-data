The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` at the index `(i + j) % 3` is unknown because we don't have the initial state of `cnt`. The other variables, including `clr[i, j]`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `(i + (n + 1)) % 3; cnt[(i + j) % 3] is increased by 1`.

Output State: **`clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `(i + (n + 1)) % 3; `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is increased by 1**
