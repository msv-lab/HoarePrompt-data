The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. Given the initial values, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, which means `(i + j) % 3` equals `0`. Therefore, `cnt[0]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` called `n` times, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements in `M`, `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0), `clr` is {(i, j): (i + j) % 3}, `cnt` is [1, 0, 0], `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is equal to 'X'.**
