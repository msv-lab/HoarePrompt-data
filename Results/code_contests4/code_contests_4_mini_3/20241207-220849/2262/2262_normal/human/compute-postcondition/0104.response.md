According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
