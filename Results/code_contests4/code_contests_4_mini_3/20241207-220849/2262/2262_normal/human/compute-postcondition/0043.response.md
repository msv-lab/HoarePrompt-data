According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`. Additionally, since `n` is a positive integer, `j` can only take values from 0 to `n - 1` in this loop. 

Thus, if the loop is to execute again, `j` will be `n`, and the loop will no longer execute because `j` will equal `n`, which is outside the valid range for the loop. However, for the sake of consistency in stating the condition, we assume that the next state will reflect that `j` is now `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is n**
