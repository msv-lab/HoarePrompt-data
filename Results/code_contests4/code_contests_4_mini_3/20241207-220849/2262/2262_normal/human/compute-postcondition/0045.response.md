The variable `cnt` at the index `[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is equal to `n`, so we have `j = n`. Therefore, `i + j` becomes `i + n`. The expression `[(i + j) % 3]` simplifies to `[(i + n) % 3]`. 

Other variables `t`, `n`, and `clr[i, j]` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged.

The output state reflects the state of the affected variable `cnt` and the unchanged variables. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is `n`, and `cnt[(i + n) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
