Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` called `n` times, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements in `M`, `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0), `clr` contains entries for all elements in the matrix `M`, where each entry is either (i + j) % 3 if `M[i][j]` is 'X' or -1 if `M[i][j]` is not 'X', and `cnt` contains the counts of 'X' in `M` categorized by the values of (i + j) % 3 across all rows and columns of `M`.**
