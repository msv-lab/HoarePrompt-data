According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, and `i` is currently less than `n` because the loop has not yet completed its range.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` is incremented, it will become `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n`, and now `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.**
