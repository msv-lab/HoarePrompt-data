According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was reset to 0, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which means that `n` is at least `i + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 

So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. The conditions for the loop to execute again would still depend on `n` being greater than `i + 1`. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
