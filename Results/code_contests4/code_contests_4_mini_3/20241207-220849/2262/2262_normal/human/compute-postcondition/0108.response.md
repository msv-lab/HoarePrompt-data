According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3. Since `n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3**
