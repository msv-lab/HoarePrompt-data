The code snippet increments the count in the `cnt` array based on the value of `(i + j) % 3`. Given the initial state, we have `i` as 0 and `j` as `n - 1`. Thus, `(i + j) % 3` evaluates to `(0 + (n - 1)) % 3`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) % 3`.

This means that `cnt[(n - 1) % 3]` will be incremented by 1. The previous values of `cnt` are not specified, but we can assume they are initialized to 0 or any other non-negative integers. Therefore, after the execution, the count at the index `((n - 1) % 3)` will increase by 1.

Since the values of `t`, `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, the output state will reflect the modification in the `cnt` array.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0; `cnt[(n - 1) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
