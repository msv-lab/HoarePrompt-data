The code initializes an empty list `M`. The states of the variables `t` and `n` are unchanged, as no operations have been performed on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100); for each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300); `M` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100); for each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300); `M` is an empty list.**
