The variable `k` is updated by adding the count of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of the list `M`, which is `M[-1]`. The count is calculated using a list comprehension that sums 1 for each occurrence of 'X' or 'O'. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but it will be increased by the total count of 'X' and 'O' found in `M[-1]`. 

Since `k` is updated based on the contents of `M[-1]`, the output will reflect the new value of `k` after this operation. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than `k + 1`, `M` is a list with an additional value appended from `func_3()`, `k` is updated to be its previous value plus the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]**.
