According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, which means `j` is currently less than `n - 1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Thus, if `j` was `j` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `j + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Given that `n` is greater than `j + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `n` should still be greater than `j + 2`.

State: **`M` is a list containing return values from `func_3()` called `n` times, `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100], `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `j + 2.**
