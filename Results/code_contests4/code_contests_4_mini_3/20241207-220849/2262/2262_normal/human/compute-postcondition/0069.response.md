The code snippet involves an operation that increments an element in the `cnt` list based on the values of `i` and `j`. Given that `j` is equal to `n`, the expression `(i + j) % 3` will compute the index in the `cnt` list to update.

However, we don't have values for `i` or `cnt`. The variable `cnt` is a list that is being indexed, and based on `(i + j) % 3`, one of its elements is incremented. Since the initial state mentions that `j` is equal to `n`, we can infer that the operation will perform as intended but without specific values for `i` or `cnt`, we can't accurately state the resulting values.

Since the values are not actually modified and we don't have specific context for `i`, we conclude that the values of `t`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, and we are performing an operation that affects `cnt` but we do not return any specific value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is equal to `n`, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
