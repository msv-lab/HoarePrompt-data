The variable `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, where `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements in `M`. The value of `k` is already defined, and since `k` is a positive integer, the result of `k / 3.0` will be a float, and `int()` will convert it to an integer by truncating any decimal part. Therefore, the state of the other variables is unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` called `n` times, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements in `M`, `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0)**
