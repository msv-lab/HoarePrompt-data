The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `j`, and `M[i][2]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `M[i][2]` is assigned 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `M[i][2]` is assigned 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.**
