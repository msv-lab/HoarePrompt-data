Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` called `n` times, `k` is equal to the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements in `M`, `K` is equal to int(k / 3.0), `clr` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is [0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the element `M[i][j]` is equal to 'X'.***
