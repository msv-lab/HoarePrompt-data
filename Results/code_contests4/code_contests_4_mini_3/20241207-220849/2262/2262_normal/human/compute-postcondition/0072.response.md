Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `clr` contains values assigned based on the conditions of `M[0][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `cnt` contains counts of how many times `(0 + j) % 3` corresponds to 'X' in `M[0][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
