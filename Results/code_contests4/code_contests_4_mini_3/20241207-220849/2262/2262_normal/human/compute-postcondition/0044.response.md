In the provided code snippet, `clr[i, j]` is being assigned the value of `(i + j) % 3`. The variables `i` and `j` are used in the calculation, with `j` being equal to `n`. The initial state indicates that `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), and `j` is equal to `n`.

The output state will depend on the values of `i` and `n`, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. However, we can express the output state in relation to the unknown `i`.

1. The value of `j` is `n`.
2. The value of `clr[i, j]` will be `(i + n) % 3`.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationship between `i` and `n` without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is `n`, and `clr[i, j]` is `(i + n) % 3`.**
