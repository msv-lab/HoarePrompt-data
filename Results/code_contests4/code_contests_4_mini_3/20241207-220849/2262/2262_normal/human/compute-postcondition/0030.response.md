The code assigns a value to `clr[i, j]` which is calculated as `(i + j) % 3`. The variables `i` and `j` are used in this calculation, and the value of `clr[i, j]` will depend on their values. The initial state mentions that `j` is `j + 1`, which means `j` has been incremented by 1 before this line executes.

Since `M` and `t` are not directly affected by this operation, we will focus on the impact on `clr[i, j]`. We do not have specific values for `i` and `j`, but we know that `j` is now one greater than its previous value.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `j`, the calculation for `clr[i, j]`, and the fact that `M` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` is a list containing return values from `func_3()` called `n` times, `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100], `j` is now incremented by 1, and `clr[i, j]` is calculated as `(i + j) % 3`.**
