The code `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` increments the value at the index `(i + j) % 3` of the list or array `cnt`. The variable `j` is equal to `n`, so we can replace `j` with `n`. Therefore, the expression becomes `cnt[(i + n) % 3] += 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `cnt` are not directly modified by this line, but the specific index in `cnt` is modified based on the values of `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact index in `cnt` that will be incremented. The output state will mention that `cnt` is modified based on the values of `i` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `j` is `n`, and `cnt[(i + n) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
