According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer (n >= 1), the loop will execute at least once if `n` is 1 or greater. To execute the loop a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer (n >= 1), and `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Since `j` is currently 1, this indicates that the loop has executed once already. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `j` is 1 (indicating the loop has executed once) and `n` is at least 2. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
