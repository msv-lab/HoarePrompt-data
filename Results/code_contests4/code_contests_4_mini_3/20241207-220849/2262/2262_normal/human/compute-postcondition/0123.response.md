According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the variable `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which means `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
