Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid; the grid consists of n strings, each containing n characters which are either '.' or 'X', and it is guaranteed that at least one cell is not empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.**
