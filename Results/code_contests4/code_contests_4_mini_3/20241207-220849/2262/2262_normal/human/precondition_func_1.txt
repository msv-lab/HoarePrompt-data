t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid for each test case, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each containing exactly n characters which are either '.' or 'X'. The character 'O' does not appear in the grid for the easy version. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
