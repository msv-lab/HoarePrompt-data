Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where there are no edges in the graph correctly. According to the problem description, the output should indicate whether two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component. However, if a graph has no edges, all nodes should be considered as separate strongly connected components. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 0
0
0
0
0
```

In this case, we have 5 nodes (0 to 4) and 0 edges. If we query whether nodes 0 and 1 belong to the same strongly connected component, the program will output `1` because it mistakenly assumes they are in the same component due to the absence of edges. However, according to the problem statement, they should actually be considered as distinct components.

Thus, the program fails to account for the situation where there are no connections between nodes, leading to incorrect results for such queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
