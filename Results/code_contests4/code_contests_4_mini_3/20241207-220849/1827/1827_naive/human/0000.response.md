To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation and see if it fulfills the requirements of checking if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component in a directed graph.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program constructs a directed graph using adjacency lists (`g` for the original graph and `rg` for the reversed graph).

2. **Finding Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**: 
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to first fill a `back_track` list with nodes in the order of completion.
   - It then processes the reversed graph to identify SCCs. Each node is marked with a component identifier (`cmp`) based on its SCC.

3. **Querying**: For each query, the program checks if two nodes `u` and `v` belong to the same SCC by comparing their component identifiers.

### Potential Issues:
- **Indexing Errors**: The program uses `xrange`, which is not available in Python 3. This suggests the program is intended for Python 2. If run in Python 3, it will raise an error.
- **Input Handling**: The program assumes that the input is well-formed according to the specified format. It does not handle cases where the input may be malformed, such as out-of-bounds accesses for `s` and `t`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where:
  - There are no edges (`|E| = 0`), which should result in every node being its own SCC.
  - There are isolated nodes that do not connect to any other nodes.

### Example Case Where the Program May Fail:
Consider a case with a single node and no edges:
```
1 0
1
0 0
```
In this case, the expected output should be "1" since the only node is trivially in the same SCC as itself. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly, and if the input size is not handled properly, it may not return the expected output.

### Conclusion:
Due to the issues identified, particularly with potential indexing errors and edge case handling, I conclude that the program does not correctly implement the functionality as described.

Correctness: **False**.
