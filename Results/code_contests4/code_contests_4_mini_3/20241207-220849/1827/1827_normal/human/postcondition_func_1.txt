The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node in a graph, a set `used` indicating which nodes have been visited, and a boolean `back_track`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `now`, marking each node as visited in `used`. After visiting all connected nodes, it appends the current node `now` to the `back_track` list. This function implements a DFS traversal of a graph without returning a value but modifies the `used` set and the `back_track` list. It does not handle cases where the graph contains cycles or where the input parameters might be invalid (e.g., `now` being out of bounds).
