The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node, an integer `num_cmp` indicating the current strongly connected component number, a list `used` which tracks the visitation status of nodes, and a list `cmp` that records the component number for each node. It marks the current node as visited, assigns it to the current component, and recursively visits all unvisited neighboring nodes to perform the same assignments. The function modifies the `used` and `cmp` lists in place but does not return any value.
