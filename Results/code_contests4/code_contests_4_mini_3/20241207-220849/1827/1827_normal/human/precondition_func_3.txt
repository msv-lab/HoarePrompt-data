n is a tuple containing a directed graph represented by a list of edges where each edge is a pair of integers (source, target), and a list of queries where each query is a pair of integers (u, v). The number of nodes |V| in the graph is inferred from the edges, and must satisfy 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000; the number of edges |E| must satisfy 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000; and the number of queries Q must satisfy 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000.
