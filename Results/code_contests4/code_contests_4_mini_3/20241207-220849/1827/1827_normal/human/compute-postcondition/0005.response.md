The function `func_2(v, used, back_track)` is called with the parameters `v`, `used`, and `back_track`. The state of `used` indicates that the node indexed by `v` (which is 0) is currently marked as `False`, meaning it has not been visited yet. The function may change the state of these variables, particularly `used`, and potentially modify `back_track` as well. However, without further information about the implementation of `func_2`, we cannot ascertain the specific changes it might make to `used` or `back_track`.

Assuming `func_2` processes the node indexed by `v` (0) and marks it as visited in `used`, it is likely that `used[0]` would be set to `True`, and depending on its logic, it might append some value to `back_track`. However, the exact details of these operations are not provided.

Therefore, the output state after executing this function call will reflect that the node 0 is now marked as visited in `used`, while the actual changes to `back_track` cannot be determined without more information.

Output State: **`used` has the first value as True, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` is a list of -1 values, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is 0**.
