According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `back_track` list. The loop iterates over `back_track` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is the last element of `back_track`, and since `used[v]` is `False`, it indicates that the loop has not yet processed this element.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next element in the reversed `back_track`. Since the current iteration has processed `v`, we now need to look at the previous element in the reversed order. If `back_track` has at least 2 elements, there will be another element to process.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `back_track` must have at least 2 elements, and `v` would now be the second last element of the list in the reversed order. 

State: **`used` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `num_cmp` is 1, `back_track` has at least 2 elements, `v` is the second last element of `back_track`, and `used[v]` is False.**
