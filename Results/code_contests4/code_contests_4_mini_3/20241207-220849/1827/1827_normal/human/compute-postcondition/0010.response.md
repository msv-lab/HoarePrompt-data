According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `v` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `v` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 1 (since `used[v]` was initially False and the function `func_2` was called with `v`, indicating that the loop executed for `v = 0` first), and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` will be incremented by 1, making `v` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`used` is a list of False values with the first value set to True, `back_track` remains unchanged, `cmp` is a list of -1 values, `n` is greater than 2, `v` is 2 if `used[v]` was initially False; if `used[v]` was initially False, the function `func_2` will be called with `v`, `used`, and `back_track`.**
