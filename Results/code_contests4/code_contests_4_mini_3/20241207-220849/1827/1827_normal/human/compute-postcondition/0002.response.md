The variable `cmp` is assigned a list that consists of `-1` repeated `n` times. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed or impacted, and the length of `cmp` will equal `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cmp` is now a list filled with `-1` values of length `n`. 

Output State: **`used` is a list of False values with a length equal to the number of nodes in the graph; `back_track` is an empty list; `cmp` is a list of -1 values with a length of n.**
