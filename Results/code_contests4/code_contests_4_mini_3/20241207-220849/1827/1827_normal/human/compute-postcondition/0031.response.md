The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a tuple consisting of two elements: a list of edges representing a directed graph and a list of queries. The edges are pairs of integers (source, target) that define connections between nodes in the graph. The function processes this graph and the queries based on the constraints provided. After executing the function body, it returns two values: the count of elements processed, denoted as `num_cmp`, and a variable `cmp`, whose value is not specified in the initial state.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `n` containing a directed graph represented by a list of edges and a list of queries, and it returns the count of elements processed (`num_cmp`) along with a variable `cmp`.**
