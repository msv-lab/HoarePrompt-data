According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `v = 0` and incrementing until `v < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `used`, `back_track`, and `cmp` does not affect the execution of the loop; they are relevant to the loop body but not to the loop's ability to start.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `n` must be greater than 0,
- `v` will start at 0.

State: **`used` is a list of False values with a length equal to the number of nodes in the graph, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of -1 values with a length of n, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is 0**
