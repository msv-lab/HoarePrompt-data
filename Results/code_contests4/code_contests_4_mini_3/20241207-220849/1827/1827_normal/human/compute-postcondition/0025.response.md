According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `back_track` in reverse order. The state at the end of the last iteration shows that `used` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, and `num_cmp` is 2. The loop variable `v` is the second last element of `back_track`, and `used[v]` is False.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the reverse order. Since `v` is currently the second last element, in the next iteration, it will be updated to the third last element. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `used` remains unchanged (still all `False`), and we need to adjust `v` to be the third last element of `back_track`. 

State: **`used` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `num_cmp` is 2, `v` is the third last element of `back_track`, and `used[v]` remains False.**
