The code initializes a list called `used` with a length equal to `n`, where each element is set to `False`. This means that if `n` is a tuple containing a directed graph represented by a list of edges, and a list of queries, the first element of `n` (the directed graph edges) will determine the number of nodes, which is the basis for the length of the `used` list. The exact number of nodes is not provided, but it is constrained between 1 and 10,000.

Since the code creates a list of `False` values, the output state reflects that the `used` list has been initialized but does not provide specific values for the graph or queries.

Output State: **`used` is a list of False values with a length equal to the number of nodes in the graph**
