According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `back_track` list. If `back_track` contains at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The `used` list is initialized with `n` elements set to `False`, which does not affect the execution of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `num_cmp` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the `back_track` list must have at least 1 element, and `v` should be assigned the last element of the `back_track` list during the first iteration.

State: **`used` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `num_cmp` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `back_track` should have at least 1 element, and `v` is the last element of `back_track`.**
