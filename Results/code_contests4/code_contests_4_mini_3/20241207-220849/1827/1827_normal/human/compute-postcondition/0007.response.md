According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `v` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `v` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0 (because `used[v]` was initially False, so `v` is not incremented), `n` is greater than 0, and `used` is a list of False values with the first value set to True, indicating that `used[0]` is True.

For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be increased by 1, making `v` equal to 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, there is no specific requirement for `n` other than it must be greater than `v` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`used` is a list of False values with the first value set to True, `back_track` remains unchanged, `cmp` is a list of -1 values, `n` is greater than 1, and `v` is 1 if `used[v]` was initially False.**
