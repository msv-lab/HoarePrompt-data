The value of `num_cmp` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The other variables, including `used`, `back_track`, and `v`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `used` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `num_cmp` is 2, `back_track` has at least 2 elements, and `v` is the second last element of `back_track`.

Output State: **`used` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `num_cmp` is 2, `back_track` has at least 2 elements, `v` is the second last element of `back_track`**.
