Postcondition: ***`used` is a list of False values with the first value set to True; `back_track` remains unchanged; `cmp` is a list of -1 values; `n` is greater than 1; `v` is 1 if `used[v]` was initially False; if `used[v]` was initially False, the function `func_2` is called with `v`, `used`, and `back_track`.***
