The code initializes an empty list `back_track`. The previous state of the variable `used` remains unchanged, as the new assignment does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `used` is a list of False values with a length equal to the number of nodes in the graph; `back_track` is an empty list.

Output State: **`used` is a list of False values with a length equal to the number of nodes in the graph; `back_track` is an empty list**
