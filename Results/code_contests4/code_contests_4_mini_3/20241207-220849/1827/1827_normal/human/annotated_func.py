#State of the program right berfore the function call: frm is a list of tuples representing directed edges in a graph, where each tuple (s, t) contains non-negative integers s and t such that 0 <= s, t < |V|, and to is a list of tuples representing queries where each tuple (u, v) contains non-negative integers u and v such that 0 <= u, v < |V|. The number of vertices |V| is between 1 and 10,000, the number of edges |E| is between 0 and 30,000, and the number of queries Q is between 1 and 100,000.
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `frm`, which represents directed edges in a graph, and a list of tuples `to`, which represents queries related to the graph. The function does not return any values or process the edges and queries; it simply appends the directed edges from `frm` to a graph structure `g` and the reverse edges to a reverse graph structure `rg`. However, it does not handle the case where `frm` and `to` are empty or where the edges may lead to invalid vertices. Additionally, the function lacks any implementation for processing the queries represented by `to`, meaning it does not determine relationships or answers based on the graph structure.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node in the graph, used is a set of integers representing the nodes already visited, and back_track is a boolean indicating whether to track the path back to the starting node.
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is the current node, `used` includes all nodes that have been visited in the graph, `back_track` remains unchanged.
    back_track.append(now)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node in a graph, a set `used` indicating which nodes have been visited, and a boolean `back_track`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `now`, marking each node as visited in `used`. After visiting all connected nodes, it appends the current node `now` to the `back_track` list. This function implements a DFS traversal of a graph without returning a value but modifies the `used` set and the `back_track` list. It does not handle cases where the graph contains cycles or where the input parameters might be invalid (e.g., `now` being out of bounds).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node, num_cmp is an integer representing the number of strongly connected components, used is a list of boolean values indicating whether each node has been visited, and cmp is a list where each index corresponds to a node and holds the component number to which the node belongs.
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is an integer representing the current node, `num_cmp` is an integer representing the number of strongly connected components, `used[now]` is True, `used[nx]` is True for all neighbors `nx` of `now`, and `cmp[now]` is assigned the value of `num_cmp`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node, an integer `num_cmp` indicating the current strongly connected component number, a list `used` which tracks the visitation status of nodes, and a list `cmp` that records the component number for each node. It marks the current node as visited, assigns it to the current component, and recursively visits all unvisited neighboring nodes to perform the same assignments. The function modifies the `used` and `cmp` lists in place but does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple containing a directed graph represented by a list of edges where each edge is a pair of integers (source, target), and a list of queries where each query is a pair of integers (u, v). The number of nodes |V| in the graph is inferred from the edges, and must satisfy 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000; the number of edges |E| must satisfy 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000; and the number of queries Q must satisfy 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000.
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used` is a list where the values corresponding to the visited nodes are set to True, `back_track` may contain values based on the execution of `func_2`, `cmp` is a list of -1 values, `n` is the total number of nodes, and `v` is not relevant after the loop completes.
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used` is a list of `n` elements indicating which elements have been processed (some may be set to True), `num_cmp` is the count of elements processed, `back_track` is a list with at least as many elements as `num_cmp`, and `v` is the last element processed from `back_track`.
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the count of elements processed, num_cmp, along with the variable cmp, whose value is not specified in the initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes the graph to identify connected components using depth-first search and returns the total number of connected components (`num_cmp`) along with a list (`cmp`) that indicates the component assignment for each node. The function does not handle the input of edges and queries, which are mentioned in the annotations but are not utilized in the code. Therefore, it only accounts for the number of nodes and their connectivity, not the edges or queries provided.
