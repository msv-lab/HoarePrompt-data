The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes the graph to identify connected components using depth-first search and returns the total number of connected components (`num_cmp`) along with a list (`cmp`) that indicates the component assignment for each node. The function does not handle the input of edges and queries, which are mentioned in the annotations but are not utilized in the code. Therefore, it only accounts for the number of nodes and their connectivity, not the edges or queries provided.
