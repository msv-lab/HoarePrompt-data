To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code and the potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires determining whether two nodes in a directed graph belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC). A directed graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other.

### Functions Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function appends directed edges to a graph structure `g` (for the graph) and `rg` (for the reverse graph).
   - **Issue**: It does not handle cases where `frm` or `to` might be empty or invalid, and it does not process the edges or queries, which is needed to determine the connectivity.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph starting from a node `now`. It marks nodes as visited and appends them to `back_track`.
   - **Issue**: It does not handle cycles or out-of-bounds values, which could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Similar to `func_2`, it performs a DFS on the reverse graph to mark nodes and assign them to components.
   - **Issue**: It also does not handle invalid input cases effectively.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function processes the graph to identify connected components using the two DFS functions.
   - **Issue**: While it correctly identifies the number of components and their assignments, it does not validate the input edges or queries against potential invalid cases.

### Output Description:
The output descriptions for each function indicate that they do not handle edge cases, such as empty inputs or invalid vertices. Moreover, the overall program does not account for the graph's properties effectively, particularly for cases where nodes might not be reachable due to missing edges or incorrect input handling.

### Conclusion:
The program does not check for invalid inputs or handle edge cases where nodes may not exist or edges may be malformed. Additionally, the output hints indicate that the functions do not process the edges or queries correctly. Thus, the implementation fails to follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
The program does not account for:
- Invalid vertices in edges and queries.
- Scenarios where no edges exist or where nodes are isolated.
- Cases where the input format may not be strictly followed, leading to potential out-of-bounds errors.
As a result, it cannot guarantee correct results for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement.
