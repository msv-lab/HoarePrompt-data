Correctness: **False**

The provided code fails to address the complete requirements outlined in the problem description. While it does implement some logic for traversing the graph and identifying strongly connected components (SCCs), it does not handle the input of edges and queries effectively.

1. **Edge Handling**: The function `func_1` is supposed to construct the graph from the edges, but it simply appends directed edges to the graph structure `g` and reverse edges to `rg`. However, it does not ensure that the edges are valid or handle the case where `frm` and `to` are empty. As a result, if the input edges are not provided or are invalid, the graph will not be constructed correctly.

2. **Query Processing**: The code does not include any logic to process the queries represented by the `to` parameter in `func_1`. This means that even if the graph is constructed correctly, the program does not produce any output for the queries, which is a critical part of the problem.

3. **Output**: The expected output of the program should be "1" if the nodes in each query belong to the same strongly connected component and "0" otherwise. However, the code does not implement any mechanism to evaluate the queries and produce the required output.

Given these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, particularly regarding input handling and output generation. Therefore, it is deemed incorrect.
