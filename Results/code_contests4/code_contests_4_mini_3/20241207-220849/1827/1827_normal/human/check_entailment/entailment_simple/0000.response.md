Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully implement the requirements of the problem description regarding checking if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC) in a directed graph.

Here are the issues identified:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not show how it handles the input for the directed graph and the queries. Specifically, it lacks the logic to read the edges and queries from the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Graph Representation**: The program snippets mention `g` and `rg` for the graph and its reverse, but these variables are not defined or initialized in the provided code. Without proper initialization and setup of these data structures, the program cannot function correctly.

3. **Query Processing**: The described program lacks any mechanism to process the queries (the pairs of nodes `(u, v)`). The expected output for each query is not generated, as there are no functions or loops to handle the queries after determining the strongly connected components.

4. **Output**: The program is expected to output "1" or "0" for each query based on whether the nodes belong to the same SCC. However, the return statement in `func_4` returns `num_cmp` and `cmp`, which is not aligned with the output requirements of the problem description.

5. **Missing Logic for Query Evaluation**: There is no implementation shown that would check if two nodes belong to the same SCC based on the `cmp` list. The program should compare the component indices of the queried nodes to determine if they are in the same SCC.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly. The missing components and logical flaws would lead to incorrect results or failure to produce results at all. Thus, the program is not correct as per the problem description.
