frm is a list of tuples representing directed edges in a graph, where each tuple (s, t) contains non-negative integers s and t such that 0 <= s, t < |V|, and to is a list of tuples representing queries where each tuple (u, v) contains non-negative integers u and v such that 0 <= u, v < |V|. The number of vertices |V| is between 1 and 10,000, the number of edges |E| is between 0 and 30,000, and the number of queries Q is between 1 and 100,000.
