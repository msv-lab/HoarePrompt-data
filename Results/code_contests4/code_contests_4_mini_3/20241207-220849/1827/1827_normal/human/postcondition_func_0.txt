The function accepts a list of tuples `frm`, which represents directed edges in a graph, and a list of tuples `to`, which represents queries related to the graph. The function does not return any values or process the edges and queries; it simply appends the directed edges from `frm` to a graph structure `g` and the reverse edges to a reverse graph structure `rg`. However, it does not handle the case where `frm` and `to` are empty or where the edges may lead to invalid vertices. Additionally, the function lacks any implementation for processing the queries represented by `to`, meaning it does not determine relationships or answers based on the graph structure.
