G is a directed graph represented by |V| nodes and |E| edges, where |V| is between 1 and 10,000 and |E| is between 0 and 30,000. Each edge is defined by a pair of nodes (s_i, t_i) for i from 0 to |E|-1. Q is a positive integer up to 100,000 representing the number of queries, each query consists of a pair of nodes (u_j, v_j) for j from 0 to Q-1, where 0 <= u_j, v_j < |V|.
