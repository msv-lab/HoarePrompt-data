The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will hold a list of strings that are split based on whitespace from the input received. The initial state of `n` does not affect the assignment of `s`, and since `raw_input()` accepts an input, the exact contents of `s` will depend on that input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` has been assigned a list of strings based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is a list of strings from user input.**
