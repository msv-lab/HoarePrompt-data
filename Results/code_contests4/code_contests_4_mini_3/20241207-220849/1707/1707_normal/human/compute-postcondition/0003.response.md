According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will hold the value of `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must start at 1, and `s` must contain at least `n` strings to populate the list `a`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `a` is a list beginning with 0 followed by the integer representations of the first `n` strings in `s`, `i` is 1**
