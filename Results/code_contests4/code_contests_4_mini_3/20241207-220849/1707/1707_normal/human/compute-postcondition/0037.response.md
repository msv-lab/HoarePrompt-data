The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates on an internal array consisting of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer in the array is strictly less than 2^30. The function processes this array and produces output based on the values it contains. 

Since the specific output behavior is not described in the provided information, we cannot detail what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on an internal array of integers that meet certain constraints. 

Functionality: **The function operates on an internal array of n non-negative integers, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each integer is strictly less than 2^30.**
