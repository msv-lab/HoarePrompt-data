According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `i` is 4. Since `j` is not less than `i`, the loop does not execute for a fifth time. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 6, which means `j` would be 6 in the next iteration. Additionally, `i` must be at least 6 for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 6, for the loop to execute a fifth time `i` must be at least 6**
