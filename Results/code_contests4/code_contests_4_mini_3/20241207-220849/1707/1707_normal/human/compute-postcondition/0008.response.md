The value of `a[i]` is updated using the XOR operation with `a[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, `a[i]` becomes `a[3] XOR a[2]`. The previous values of `a[2]` and `a[1]` are known: `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] XOR a[1]`, which means `a[2]` now holds a new value based on the previous `a[2]` and `a[1]`. However, the specific values of `a[1]` and `a[2]` are not defined in the initial state, only their operations and relationships are defined. Thus, after this operation, the state of the variables is impacted.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be at least 3; `s` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements; `a[0]` is 0; `a[1]` is the same as before; `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] XOR a[1]`; `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] XOR a[2]`; `i` is 3.**
