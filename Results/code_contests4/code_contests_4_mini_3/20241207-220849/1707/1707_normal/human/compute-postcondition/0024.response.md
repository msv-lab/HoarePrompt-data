According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will iterate for values of `j` starting from 0 up to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `i` is 3. This means the loop has executed for `j = 0`, `j = 1`, and `j = 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3, but since `j` must be less than `i`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `i` must be greater than 3**
