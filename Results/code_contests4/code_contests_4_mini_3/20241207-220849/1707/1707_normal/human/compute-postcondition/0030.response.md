According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, and `i` is at least 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 5, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 5.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 5, for the loop to execute a fifth time `i` must be greater than 5**
