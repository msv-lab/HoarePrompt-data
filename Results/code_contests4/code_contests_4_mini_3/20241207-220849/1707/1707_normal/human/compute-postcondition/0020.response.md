According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is currently set to 3. The loop will execute `i` times, meaning it will iterate for `j` values from 0 to 2 (inclusive). The state before the loop indicates that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `s` is a list with at least `n` elements. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` would need to be 1 during the first execution and increment to 2 in the second execution. The current state of `i` being 3 allows this, and `n` being at least 3 is also satisfied because it is stated that for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Thus, the variables that need to be ensured for the loop to execute properly are:
- `i` is 3 (allowing two more iterations to occur).
- `n` is at least 3 (to satisfy the condition for the loop to execute a second time).
- `j` will start from 0 and will be 1 during the first execution.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
