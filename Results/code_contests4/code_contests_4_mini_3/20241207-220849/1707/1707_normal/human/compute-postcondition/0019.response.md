According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be 3, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the condition `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute once more.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
