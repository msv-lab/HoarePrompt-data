According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the limit defined by `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than 3.**
