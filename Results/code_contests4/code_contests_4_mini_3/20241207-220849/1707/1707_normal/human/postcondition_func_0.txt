The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an array of `n` non-negative integers (each strictly less than 2^30) from the user input. It computes the maximum XOR value obtainable from any two elements of an internal array, which is derived from the cumulative XOR of the input integers. The function then prints this maximum XOR value. It does not handle cases where the input might not conform to the specified constraints (e.g., non-integer inputs or integers out of the specified range).
