The value of `i` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `i` is unknown. The values of `n` and `cap` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` if `n` is even or `sqrt(n)` if `n` is odd; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` if `n` is even or `sqrt(n)` if `n` is odd; `i` is increased by 1.**
