`b` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(k)`, which calculates the factorial of `k`. The initial states of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. However, since `k` is an integer and its value is not provided, `b` can take on any value depending on the input for `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`.**
