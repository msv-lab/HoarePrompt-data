The code `ans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but since the loop condition mentions that `i` must be less than or equal to `cap`, we can assume that `i` is a valid integer within that range.

The variables `n` and `cap` are not directly affected by this operation, and the states of those variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` if `n` is even or `sqrt(n)` if `n` is odd; `i` has been appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` if `n` is even or `sqrt(n)` if `n` is odd; `i` has been appended to `ans.**
