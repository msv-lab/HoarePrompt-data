The value of `n` is updated to be the integer division of `n` by `i`. Since `n` is an integer within the range of 4 to 10^6 and `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, the value of `n` will change based on the current value of `i`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not specified in detail, but `n` will definitely be decreased. Other variables (`cap`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, and `i` has been appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, and `i` has been appended to `ans**
