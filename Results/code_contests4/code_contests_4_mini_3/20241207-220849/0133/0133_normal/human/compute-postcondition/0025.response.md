Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is less than or equal to `cap`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` is appended to `ans`, and `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`. Otherwise, `n` remains within the range 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and `i` is increased by 1.***
