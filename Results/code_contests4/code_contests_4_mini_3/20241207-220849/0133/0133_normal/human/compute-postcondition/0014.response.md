To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The loop condition is `i <= cap`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `cap`.

From the provided state:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6.
- If `n` is even, then `ans` is updated to [2], `n` is halved, and `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n // 2)`.
- If `n` is odd, then `ans` remains empty, `i` is set to 3, and `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`.

Since `cap` is dependent on the value of `n`, we need to consider the following cases:

1. **If `n` is even**: 
   - `cap` would be `sqrt(n // 2)`.
   - In this case, to ensure that the loop can execute again, `i` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `cap`.

2. **If `n` is odd**: 
   - `cap` would be `sqrt(n)`.
   - Here, `i` is already set to 3, thus we need to ensure that `i` remains less than or equal to `cap`.

Given that we don't know the exact current values of `i` and `cap`, we cannot make specific numerical adjustments. However, we can state that for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `cap` is greater than or equal to the current value of `i`.

Therefore, we can summarize the adjustments needed:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; if `n` is even, then `cap` is `sqrt(n // 2`; if `n` is odd, then `cap` is `sqrt(n)`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `cap`.**
