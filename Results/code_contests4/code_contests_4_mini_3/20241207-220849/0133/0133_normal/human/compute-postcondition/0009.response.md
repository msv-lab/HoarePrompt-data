The variable `div` is assigned the value of `a // (b * c)`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `a` is the factorial of `n`, `b` is the factorial of `k`, and `c` is the factorial of `n - k`. The value of `div` represents the number of combinations for choosing `k` elements from `n`, denoted as C(n, k). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`; `c` is the factorial of `n - k`; `div` is the value of a // (b * c).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`; `c` is the factorial of `n - k`; `div` is the value of a // (b * c)**
