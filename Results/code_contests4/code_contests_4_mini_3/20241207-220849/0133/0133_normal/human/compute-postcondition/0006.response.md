The variable `a` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n)`, which computes the factorial of `n`. Since `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `a` will hold the factorial value of `n`, which is a large integer. The values of `k` and other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`.**
