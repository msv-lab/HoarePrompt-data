According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cap`. If `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cap` is recalculated based on the value of `n`. 

Given that `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, if `i` is a divisor of `n`, then `n` is updated to `n // i`, which would change `cap` to `sqrt(n)`. If `i` is not a divisor of `n`, `n` remains unchanged and `cap` is calculated as `sqrt(n // 2)` if `n` is even or `sqrt(n)` if `n` is odd.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `cap`. Therefore, if we know the current value of `cap` at the end of the last iteration, we need to verify if `i` is still less than or equal to it. If `i` is equal to `cap`, we can let it stay the same; otherwise, we may need to adjust `cap` to ensure the condition holds.

However, since the exact values of `n`, `cap`, and `i` are not provided, we cannot make specific adjustments without making assumptions. We can only conclude that the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to `cap`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is less than or equal to `cap`**
