The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^6. The value of `cap` depends on whether `n` is even or odd, but since we are assigning `cap = sqrt(n)`, it implies that this code executes as if `n` is treated as odd in this context. The variable `i` has already been appended to `ans`, and `n` has been modified to `n // i`. 

Now, `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`. The output state will reflect the assignment of `cap` based on the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is now `n // i`; `cap` is sqrt(n)**
