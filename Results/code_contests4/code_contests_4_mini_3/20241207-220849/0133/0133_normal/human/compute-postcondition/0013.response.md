Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; if `n` is divisible by 2, then `ans` is updated to [2], `n` is halved (i.e., `n` is updated to `n // 2`), and `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n // 2)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list, `i` is set to 3, and `cap` remains as `sqrt(n)` with `n` being odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`).***
