To calculate the value of `c`, we need to evaluate `math.factorial(n - k)`. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and `k` is an integer, the value of `n - k` will also be an integer. This means that `c` will be assigned the factorial of the result of `n - k`. The values of `a` and `b` (which are `n!` and `k!`, respectively) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, we can state the output based on the current values of the affected variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`; `c` is the factorial of `n - k`.**
