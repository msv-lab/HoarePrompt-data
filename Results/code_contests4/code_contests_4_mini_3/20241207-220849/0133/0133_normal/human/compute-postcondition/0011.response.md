The function `func_7` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^6 \), and the parameter `k` is also an integer. After executing the function body, the function can return one of three possible outputs: 

- If Case_1 is fulfilled, the function returns the integer 1.
- If Case_2 is fulfilled, the function returns 0.
- If Case_3 is fulfilled, the function returns the value of `div`, which is calculated using the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n - k)!} \).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept two integers, `n` (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^6 \)) and `k`, and return either 1, 0, or the result of the combination formula based on specific conditions related to the values of `n` and `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 3 and 10^6) and k (an integer), and returns 1, 0, or the combination C(n, k) based on the conditions evaluated in the function.**
