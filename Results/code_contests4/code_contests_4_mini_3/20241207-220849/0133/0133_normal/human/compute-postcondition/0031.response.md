The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^6 \). After executing the function body, if `n` is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the single integer 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns a list of all prime factors of `n`, which includes `n` itself if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `n` and return either the list containing the integer 1 or a list of all prime factors of `n` based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns a list containing the single integer 1 if n is equal to 1; otherwise, it returns a list of all prime factors of n if n is greater than 1.**
