The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is stated that `i` is less than or equal to `cap`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `i` has been increased by 1 without altering the values of `n` or `cap`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `i` is increased by 1**
