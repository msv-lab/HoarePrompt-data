Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for counting cyclic permutations of length `n`. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions that read input (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) do not enforce the constraints that `n` must be between 3 and 10^6. They simply read whatever input is provided without validating it against the problem requirements. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input does not meet the specified conditions.

2. **Missing Logic**: There is no implementation that actually constructs the graph based on the permutation `p` as described in the problem. The permutation is never generated or evaluated to determine if it results in a cyclic graph. 

3. **Cyclic Permutation Calculation**: The code does not contain any logic to count cyclic permutations. It references combinations (`func_7`), which is unrelated to the problem of counting cyclic permutations defined by the edges in the described graph.

4. **Edge Cases**: The annotations hint at the fact that edge cases (like invalid or unexpected inputs) are not handled, which would affect the correctness of the output in various scenarios.

Given these issues, the code does not fulfill the requirement to compute the number of cyclic permutations correctly for every valid input `n`. Thus, the program is incorrect.
