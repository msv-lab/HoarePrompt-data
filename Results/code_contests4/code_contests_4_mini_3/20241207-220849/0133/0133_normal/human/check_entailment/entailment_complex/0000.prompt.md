You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Consider a permutation p of length n, we build a graph of size n using it as follows: 

  * For every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, find the largest j such that 1 ≤ j < i and p_j > p_i, and add an undirected edge between node i and node j 
  * For every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, find the smallest j such that i < j ≤ n and p_j > p_i, and add an undirected edge between node i and node j 



In cases where no such j exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges between the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices.

For clarity, consider as an example n = 4, and p = [3,1,4,2]; here, the edges of the graph are (1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3).

A permutation p is cyclic if the graph built using p has at least one simple cycle. 

Given n, find the number of cyclic permutations of length n. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.

Please refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycle

Input

The first and only line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

Output

Note

There are 16 cyclic permutations for n = 4. [4,2,1,3] is one such permutation, having a cycle of length four: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 4.

Nodes v_1, v_2, …, v_k form a simple cycle if the following conditions hold: 

  * k ≥ 3. 
  * v_i ≠ v_j for any pair of indices i and j. (1 ≤ i < j ≤ k) 
  * v_i and v_{i+1} share an edge for all i (1 ≤ i < k), and v_1 and v_k share an edge. 
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from user input, which must satisfy the condition 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input and returns it as an integer. However, it does not enforce the condition that the integer must satisfy 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; it simply returns whatever integer the user inputs without validation.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input, where the number of integers entered is determined by the value of n, which is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input. The number of integers that can be input is determined by the variable `n`, which is expected to be in the range of 3 to 10^6. However, the code does not enforce this range or check the validity of the input, meaning that if the user enters fewer than 3 integers or non-integer values, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters from the string 's' except for the last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list containing all characters from the input string `s`, excluding the last character. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts the input split strings into integers, which can represent a sequence of integers based on user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object that converts the space-separated input strings into integers, allowing the user to input a sequence of integers. Since the function relies on user input, it does not handle cases where the input may not be valid integers, which could lead to a ValueError when the conversion is attempted.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string 's' by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `s` on spaces. It does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to invalid input, such as an empty string or input containing only spaces, which could result in returning an empty list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_6(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return [1]
        #The program returns the list containing the single integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and `n` is not equal to 1.
    ans = []
    i = 2
    cap = sqrt(n)
    while i <= cap:
        if n % i == 0:
            ans.append(i)
            n = n // i
            cap = sqrt(n)
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a prime number or 1, `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n`, `i` is greater than `cap`, and `cap` is the square root of the final value of `n`.
    if (n > 1) :
        ans.append(n)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a prime number or 1; `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n`, and if `n` is greater than 1, `ans` includes the value of `n` as well.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list of all prime factors of the original value of `n`, which includes `n` itself if `n` is greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of all prime factors of `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns a list containing the single integer 1. If `n` is a prime number, the list will include `n` itself as the only element. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 3, which are outside the specified range.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and k is an integer.
def func_7(n, k):
    if (n == 1 or n == k) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `k` is an integer, and `n` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to `k`.
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        a = math.factorial(n)
        b = math.factorial(k)
        c = math.factorial(n - k)
        div = a // (b * c)
        return div
        #The program returns the value of div, which is the result of the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where 'n' is an integer between 3 and 10^6, 'k' is an integer, 'a' is n!, 'b' is k!, and 'c' is (n - k)!
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `k`. It returns 1 if `n` is equal to 1 or `k`, returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`, and otherwise returns the value of the combination C(n, k) calculated using the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
