To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the provided functions and their output descriptions.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of cyclic permutations of length `n`. A permutation is cyclic if the graph constructed from it has at least one simple cycle. The output should be the count of such cyclic permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Functions Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Accepts an integer input but does not enforce the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\). If an invalid integer is inputted, it could lead to problems later.
   
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Similar to `func_1`, it accepts input without enforcing the range. If fewer than 3 integers are input, it may lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Returns a list of all characters from the input string excluding the last character. This function is not relevant to the main problem.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: Similar to `func_2`, it returns a map object of integers from space-separated input but does not validate the input, which could cause issues.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: Splits the input string on spaces and does not handle invalid input, which could lead to empty lists.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**: Returns prime factors of `n`, but it does not handle cases where \(n < 3\) properly, which is outside the specified range.

7. **Function 7 (`func_7`)**: This function calculates combinations but is only relevant if \(k\) is provided, and it does not handle cases where \(n\) is invalid.

8. **Main Logic**: Combines the results and performs calculations to derive the number of cyclic permutations, but the lack of input validation across all functions raises concerns.

### Output Descriptions Validation:
The output descriptions for each function indicate that they do not enforce input validation for the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\). This could lead to scenarios where invalid input could break the logic, especially in a competitive programming context where such conditions are crucial.

### Edge Cases:
An edge case to consider is if the user inputs a number less than 3 (e.g., 2 or 1) or a number greater than \(10^6\). In such cases, the program does not handle the input properly, which could lead to incorrect outputs or runtime errors.

### Conclusion:
Given that there are no checks for input validation and the functions can behave unexpectedly with out-of-range values, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be evaluated as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases due to the lack of input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect outputs.
