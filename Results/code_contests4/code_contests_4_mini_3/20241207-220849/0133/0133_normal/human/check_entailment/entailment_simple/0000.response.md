Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Missing Core Logic**: The program does not have any function or logic that constructs the graph based on the permutation as described in the problem. There are no functions that analyze the permutation `p` to find edges according to the rules specified.

2. **No Calculation of Cyclic Permutations**: The problem specifically asks for the number of cyclic permutations of length `n`, but the program does not contain any code to compute this value. The functions provided (e.g., `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) do not relate to the process of calculating cyclic permutations or identifying cycles in a graph.

3. **Inappropriate Functions**: The functions included in the program deal with input manipulation and prime factorization but do not address the need to determine cycles in a graph based on the permutation. For example, `func_6` is about finding prime factors, which is irrelevant to the task at hand.

4. **Lack of Modulo Operation**: The output requirement specifies that the result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but there is no implementation present to perform this operation in the context of counting cyclic permutations.

In summary, the program lacks the necessary components to solve the problem as defined in the description. It neither constructs a graph from a permutation nor counts the cyclic permutations, thus failing to meet the problem requirements completely.
