The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input. The number of integers that can be input is determined by the variable `n`, which is expected to be in the range of 3 to 10^6. However, the code does not enforce this range or check the validity of the input, meaning that if the user enters fewer than 3 integers or non-integer values, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
