#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from user input, which must satisfy the condition 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input and returns it as an integer. However, it does not enforce the condition that the integer must satisfy 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; it simply returns whatever integer the user inputs without validation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input, where the number of integers entered is determined by the value of n, which is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input. The number of integers that can be input is determined by the variable `n`, which is expected to be in the range of 3 to 10^6. However, the code does not enforce this range or check the validity of the input, meaning that if the user enters fewer than 3 integers or non-integer values, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters from the string 's' except for the last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list containing all characters from the input string `s`, excluding the last character. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts the input split strings into integers, which can represent a sequence of integers based on user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object that converts the space-separated input strings into integers, allowing the user to input a sequence of integers. Since the function relies on user input, it does not handle cases where the input may not be valid integers, which could lead to a ValueError when the conversion is attempted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string 's' by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `s` on spaces. It does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to invalid input, such as an empty string or input containing only spaces, which could result in returning an empty list.

    #The program returns the list of all prime factors of the original value of `n`, which includes `n` itself if `n` is greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of all prime factors of `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns a list containing the single integer 1. If `n` is a prime number, the list will include `n` itself as the only element. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 3, which are outside the specified range.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `k`. It returns 1 if `n` is equal to 1 or `k`, returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`, and otherwise returns the value of the combination C(n, k) calculated using the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).
