The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of all prime factors of `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns a list containing the single integer 1. If `n` is a prime number, the list will include `n` itself as the only element. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 3, which are outside the specified range.
