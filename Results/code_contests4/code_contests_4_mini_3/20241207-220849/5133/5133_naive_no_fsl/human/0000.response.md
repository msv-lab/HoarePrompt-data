Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem description. According to the input format, the two integers A and B should be read from a single line, separated by a space. However, in the program, the integers are read one after the other using two separate `input()` calls. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3 1
```
The program will read `3` for variable `a` and then read `1` for variable `b`. This is incorrect because the input should be read in a single line.

To correctly implement the input, the program should instead use:
```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

Due to this issue, the program will not function correctly for the provided input format, leading to an incorrect result.
