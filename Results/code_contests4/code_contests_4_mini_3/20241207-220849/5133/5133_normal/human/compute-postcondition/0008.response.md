The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it is expected to return some output based on the integer values of `A` and `B`, which are constrained to be within the range of -1000 to 1000. However, without specific output conditions provided, we cannot determine the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently unspecified with respect to its output based on the parameters `A` and `B`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is currently unspecified.**
