`ary` is assigned a list containing the values of `c`, `d`, and `e`. The value of `e` is determined by the product of `A` and `B`. The values of `c` and `d` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= `A`, `B` <= 1000; `e` is `A * B`; `ary` is a list containing `c`, `d`, and `e`.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= `A`, `B` <= 1000; `e` is `A * B`; `ary` is a list containing `c`, `d`, and `e`.**
