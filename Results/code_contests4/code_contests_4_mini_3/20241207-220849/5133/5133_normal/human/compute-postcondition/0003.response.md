The variable `d` is assigned the value of `a - b`. The values of `A` and `B` (which are integers within the range of -1000 to 1000) remain unchanged, and `c` is previously defined as `A + B`. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= `A`, `B` <= 1000; `c` is `A + B`; `d` is `A - B`.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= `A`, `B` <= 1000; `c` is `A + B`; `d` is `A - B**
