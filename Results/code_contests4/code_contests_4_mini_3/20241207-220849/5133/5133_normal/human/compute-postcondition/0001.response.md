The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged, while `b` takes on the value of the input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= `A`, `B` <= 1000; `b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= `A`, `B` <= 1000; `b` is an input integer**
