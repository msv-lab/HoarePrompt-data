Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly read the input values for A and B. Instead of reading a single line containing both integers A and B, it attempts to read them separately with two calls to `input()`. This will cause an error when the input is provided in the format "A B" because it expects two separate lines for input.

To fix the program, it should read the entire line of input, split it into two parts, and then convert those parts to integers. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c = a + b
    d = a - b
    e = a * b
    ary = [c, d, e]
    f = max(ary)
    print(f)
```

In this corrected version, the input is read as a single line, split into two parts, and converted to integers correctly, which aligns with the problem description.
