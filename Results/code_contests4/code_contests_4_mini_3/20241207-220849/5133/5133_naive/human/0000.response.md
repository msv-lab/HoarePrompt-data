Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not read the input values A and B properly. The input is given in the format "A B" on a single line, but the program attempts to read A and B from separate lines using `int(input())` for both variables. This will lead to an error when the input is provided as a single line.

For example, if the input is:
```
3 1
```
The program will wait for an additional input for `b`, causing it to fail.

The correct way to read the input should involve splitting the single line input into two integers, for example:
```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

Since the program does not handle the input as described, it does not work correctly for the specified problem description.
