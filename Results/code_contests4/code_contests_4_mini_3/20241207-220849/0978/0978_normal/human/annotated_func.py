#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the number of horizontal rows (1 <= x <= 500), y is a positive integer representing the number of vertical columns (1 <= y <= 500). Additionally, the grid a_ij contains integers a_{ij} where 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9.
def func_1(x, y):
    if (x >= y) :
        if (x % y == 0) :
            return y
            #The program returns the positive integer 'y' representing the number of vertical columns, which is also a positive integer between 1 and 500
        else :
            return func_1(y, x % y)
            #The program returns the result of func_1 with parameters y and the remainder of x divided by y, which is x % y.
    else :
        if (y % x == 0) :
            return x
            #The program returns the positive integer x representing the number of horizontal rows, which is less than y and between 1 and 500
        else :
            return func_1(x, y % x)
            #The program returns the result of func_1 with parameters x and the remainder of y divided by x, which is y % x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, which represent the dimensions of a grid. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the GCD, which will always be a positive integer less than or equal to the smaller of the two inputs. The function handles cases where one number is divisible by the other and recursively calls itself with modified parameters until it reaches the base case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x4 is a list of lists of integers where each inner list represents a row in a grid with H rows and W columns (1 ≤ H, W ≤ 500), and each integer a_{ij} (0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 9) represents the number of coins in cell (i, j).
def func_2(x4):
    if (len(x4) > 2) :
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
        #The program returns the result of func_2, which processes the first row transformed by func_1 with the second row, followed by the remaining rows of the grid in x4, where x4 is a list of lists of integers representing a grid containing coin counts.
    else :
        if (len(x4) == 2) :
            return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
            #The program returns the result of func_1 applied to the first and second rows of the grid represented by x4, where each row contains integers representing the number of coins in each cell.
        else :
            return x4[0]
            #The program returns the first (and only) inner list from the list of lists `x4`, which represents the first row of the grid containing integers (0 to 9) that indicate the number of coins in each cell.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `x4`, representing a grid of coin counts, where each inner list corresponds to a row of integers (0 to 9). If the grid has more than two rows, it recursively processes the first two rows using `func_1`, replacing the first row with the result and continuing with the rest of the grid. If the grid has exactly two rows, it simply applies `func_1` to these rows. If the grid has only one row, it returns that row directly.
