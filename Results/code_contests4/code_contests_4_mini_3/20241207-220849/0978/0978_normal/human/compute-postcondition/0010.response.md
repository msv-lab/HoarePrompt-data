The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are positive integers, with `x` representing the number of horizontal rows and `y` representing the number of vertical columns, constrained between 1 and 500. 

The function can return different values based on the following cases:
- **Case 1**: If the condition is met, the function returns the positive integer `y`, which represents the number of vertical columns.
- **Case 2**: If this case applies, the function returns the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y` (i.e., `x % y`).
- **Case 3**: If this case applies, the function returns the positive integer `x`, which is less than `y` and between 1 and 500.
- **Case 4**: If this case applies, the function returns the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `x` and the remainder of `y` divided by `x` (i.e., `y % x`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `x` and `y` representing the dimensions of a grid and return values based on specific conditions related to these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` and `y`, both positive integers representing the dimensions of a grid. It returns `y` under certain conditions, calls itself recursively with modified parameters in some cases, and returns `x` when `x` is less than `y`.**
