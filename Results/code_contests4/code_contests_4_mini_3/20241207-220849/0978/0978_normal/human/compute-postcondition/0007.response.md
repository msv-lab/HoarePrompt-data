The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`. `x4` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list represents a row in a grid containing coin counts, with constraints that the number of rows (H) and columns (W) can each range from 1 to 500, and each integer in the grid (a_{ij}) ranges from 0 to 9. 

The function can return different values based on specific cases:
- In **Case 1**, it returns the result of processing the first row transformed by another function (func_1) with the second row, followed by the remaining rows of the grid in `x4`.
- In **Case 2**, it returns the result of applying func_1 to the first and second rows of the grid represented by `x4`.
- In **Case 3**, it returns the first (and only) inner list from the list of lists `x4`, which represents the first row of the grid containing integers indicating the number of coins in each cell.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a grid (list of lists) of integers representing coin counts and return different processed results based on the rows of this grid. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x4 (a list of lists of integers representing a grid of coin counts) and returns processed results based on the rows of this grid, including transformations applied to the first two rows, or the first row itself.**
