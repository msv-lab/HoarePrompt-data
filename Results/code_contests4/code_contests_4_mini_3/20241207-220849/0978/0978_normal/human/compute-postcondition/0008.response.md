Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists `x4`, representing a grid of coin counts, where each inner list corresponds to a row of integers (0 to 9). If the grid has more than two rows, it recursively processes the first two rows using `func_1`, replacing the first row with the result and continuing with the rest of the grid. If the grid has exactly two rows, it simply applies `func_1` to these rows. If the grid has only one row, it returns that row directly.**
