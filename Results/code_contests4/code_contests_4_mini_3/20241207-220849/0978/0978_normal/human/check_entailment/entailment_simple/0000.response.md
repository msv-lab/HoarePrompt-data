Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the given problem description for several reasons:

1. **Function Purpose**: The `func_1` and `func_2` functions do not perform any operations related to moving coins between cells in a grid. Instead, they seem to implement a form of recursive logic that resembles the calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This is unrelated to the task of maximizing the number of cells containing an even number of coins.

2. **Input Handling**: While the input format describes a grid of integers representing coins in each cell, the functions do not process the grid in a way that relates to moving coins. Specifically, `func_2` is designed to work with lists of integers, but it does not implement any logic to move coins or produce the required output format.

3. **Output Specification**: The program does not generate the sequence of operations needed to show how coins are moved between cells. According to the problem description, the output should include the number of operations followed by each operation's details (the source and destination cells). However, the program lacks any mechanism to construct and return such operations.

4. **Correctness of Operations**: The program does not ensure that the final state of the grid maximizes the number of cells with an even number of coins, which is the main objective of the problem.

In summary, the program does not implement the necessary logic to fulfill the requirements of the problem description, including moving coins, tracking operations, or maximizing even-numbered cells. Therefore, it is incorrect.
