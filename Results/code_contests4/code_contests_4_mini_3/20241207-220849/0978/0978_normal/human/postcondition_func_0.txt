The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, which represent the dimensions of a grid. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the GCD, which will always be a positive integer less than or equal to the smaller of the two inputs. The function handles cases where one number is divisible by the other and recursively calls itself with modified parameters until it reaches the base case.
