Correctness: **False**.

The program does not contain any code inside the triple quotes, which means there is no implementation to handle the problem description. As a result, it cannot perform the required operations of checking if roads have been asphalted and determining which days the workers will be able to asphalt the roads. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem requirements in any potential case.
