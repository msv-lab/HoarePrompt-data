#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the next n² lines contain pairs of integers (hi, vi) where 1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n, representing distinct intersections.
def func():
    """
    """
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (within the range 1 to 50) and reads `n²` pairs of integers `(hi, vi)` (where both `hi` and `vi` are within the range 1 to `n`), representing intersections. However, the actual implementation of processing or producing output based on these intersections is not provided in the annotated code, leaving the functionality incomplete.
