Correctness: **False**

The annotated program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem description. 

1. The function `func()` is defined, but it lacks an implementation to read the input values of `n` and the subsequent `nÂ²` pairs of integers `(hi, vi)` that represent the intersections. This means that the program does not process any input, which is crucial to solve the problem.

2. There are no operations to track which roads have been asphalted, nor does it contain any logic to determine when the workers will asphalt the roads based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

3. The output of the days on which at least one road is asphalted is also missing from the program. The problem description requires the function to output the days in ascending order when road works are in progress.

Since the program is incomplete and does not perform any of the necessary steps outlined in the problem description, it cannot be considered correct.
