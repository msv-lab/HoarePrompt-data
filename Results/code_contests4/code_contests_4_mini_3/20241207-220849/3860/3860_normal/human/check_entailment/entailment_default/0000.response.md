Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any actual code to process the input or produce the expected output. The output hints mention that the function reads pairs of integers representing intersections, but without any implementation, the code cannot fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Since it fails to perform any operations to determine which days the roads will be asphalted, it does not follow the problem description for all cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.
