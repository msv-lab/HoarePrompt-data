Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (within the range 1 to 50) and reads `nÂ²` pairs of integers `(hi, vi)` (where both `hi` and `vi` are within the range 1 to `n`), representing intersections. However, the actual implementation of processing or producing output based on these intersections is not provided in the annotated code, leaving the functionality incomplete. **
