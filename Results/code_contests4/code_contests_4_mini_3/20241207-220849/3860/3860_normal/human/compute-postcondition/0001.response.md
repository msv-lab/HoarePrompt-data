The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it processes input data consisting of an integer `n` that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. Following this, the function reads `n²` pairs of integers (hi, vi) where each pair represents distinct intersections and both integers must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n. After processing this input, the function produces an output based on the input data, though the specifics of this output are not provided in the description. 

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and n² pairs of integers (hi, vi) (1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n) representing distinct intersections, and produces an output based on this input.**
