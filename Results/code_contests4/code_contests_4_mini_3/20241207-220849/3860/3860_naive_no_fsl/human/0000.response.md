Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not include any source code, which makes it impossible to analyze its functionality or correctness based on the problem description. Without the code, I cannot determine how it handles different inputs or whether it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. As a result, I cannot confirm the correctness of the program. 

To illustrate a potential issue, consider the case where:
```
Input:
2
1 1
2 2
1 2
2 1
```
Without the actual code, I cannot ascertain if the program would correctly follow the logic of asphalting the roads based on prior state checks. Therefore, the absence of source code leads me to conclude that the correctness is **False** due to the inability to verify the program's behavior.
