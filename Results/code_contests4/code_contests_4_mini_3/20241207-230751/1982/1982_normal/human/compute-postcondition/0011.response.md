The value of `i` is modified by prepending '1' and appending '0' to its current value. Since `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value after this operation. However, we know that it will be a string that begins with '1' and ends with '0'. The other variables, `n` and `p`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `i` is now '1' + its previous value + '0'; `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `i` is now '1' + its previous value + '0'; `p` remains unchanged.**
