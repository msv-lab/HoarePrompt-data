According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the integer value of `i` in binary (converted to decimal) is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is now '1' + its previous value + '0', which means `i` has been updated to be a binary number that is greater than its previous value. For example, if the previous value of `i` was '0', then `i` would now be '10' (which is 2 in decimal). If the previous value of `i` was '1', then `i` would now be '110' (which is 6 in decimal), and so on.

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, and the condition states `int(i, 2) <= n`, it implies that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least as large as the new decimal value of `i`. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to ensure that it can accommodate the new value of `i`.

To summarize, if `i` has been updated to a binary number that is greater than its previous value, then `n` must be adjusted accordingly to ensure that `int(i, 2)` is still less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is now '1' + its previous value + '0' and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least equal to int(i, 2)**
