The variable `p` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `p` while keeping the states of `n` and `i` as they are.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `i` is '110'; `p` is 1**
