`p` is assigned the value of `int(i, 2)`, which converts the binary string '110' to its integer equivalent. The binary '110' equals 6. Therefore, after execution, `p` is 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `i` is '110', `n` is greater than or equal to 6, and `n` is divisible by 6; `p` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `i` is '110', `n` is greater than or equal to 6, and `n` is divisible by 6; `p` is 6**
