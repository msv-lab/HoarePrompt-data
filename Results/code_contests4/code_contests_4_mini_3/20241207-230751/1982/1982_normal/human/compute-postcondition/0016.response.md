The loop constructs the binary string `i` by prepending '1' and appending '0' in each iteration. The condition checks whether the integer value of `i` in binary is less than or equal to `n`. The variable `p` is updated to the integer value of `i` in binary if `n` is divisible by this value.

At the end of the loop, the value of `i` will continue to grow until it exceeds `n`, and `p` will contain the last valid binary integer value of `i` that divides `n` before the loop condition fails.

Given that `n` is an integer in the range [1, 100000], the loop will keep executing until the binary representation of `i` exceeds `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `i` is a binary string that exceeds `n`, `p` is the largest binary value of `i` (in decimal) that divides `n` before `i` exceeded `n`.**
