The value of `i` is assigned the value `'1' + i + '0'`. The current value of `i` is `'110'`, so the new value of `i` becomes `'1' + '110' + '0'`, which results in `'11100'`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `i` is '11100'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `i` is '11100'**
