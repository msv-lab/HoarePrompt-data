The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate under the constraint that an integer `n` is implicitly understood to be available within the function, satisfying the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. Given that we do not have specific output conditions or cases provided in the prompt, we cannot ascertain the exact output of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function remains unclear without additional context on how `n` is used or what the function returns. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is intended to operate with an integer n that satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, but its output is not defined without further details.**
