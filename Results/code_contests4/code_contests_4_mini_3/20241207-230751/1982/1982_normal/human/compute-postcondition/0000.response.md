The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since it is specified that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, the exact value of `n` will depend on the input provided. Other variables are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000**
