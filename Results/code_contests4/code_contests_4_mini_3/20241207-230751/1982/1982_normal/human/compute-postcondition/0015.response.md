The value of `i` is updated to be the string '1' concatenated with its previous value and then '0' appended at the end. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `i`, but we know that it will always change based on its previous state. The values of `n` and the condition regarding divisibility do not affect the value of `i`. Thus, the output will reflect the new value of `i`, but the exact value cannot be determined without knowing the previous value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `i` is updated to '1' + previous value of `i` + '0'**
