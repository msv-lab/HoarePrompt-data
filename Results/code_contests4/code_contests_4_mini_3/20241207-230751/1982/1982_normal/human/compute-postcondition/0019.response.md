Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`. It constructs binary numbers starting from '110' and checks divisibility of `n` by these binary values converted to decimal. The function identifies the largest binary number (in decimal) that divides `n` before exceeding `n`, and prints this value. If no binary number divides `n`, the default output of `p` will remain 1, which is the initial value assigned.**
