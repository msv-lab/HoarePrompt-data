Correctness: **False**.

The provided program only reads input values and does not implement any logic for counting the integers \( x \) in the range \([a; b]\) that satisfy the condition \( f(x) = x \) for at least 7 permutations of the four distinct numbers \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \). 

A potential case where the program fails is:
- Input: `1 2 3 4 1 10`
  
The expected output would require the program to analyze the permutations of the numbers and check the condition against the integers from 1 to 10. However, the program does nothing beyond reading the input. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem requirements.
