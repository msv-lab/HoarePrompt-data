Correctness: **False**

The provided program only reads input values and does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, it does not implement the necessary steps to:

1. Count the number of integers \( x \) in the range \([a; b]\) such that there are at least 7 permutations of the numbers \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \) for which \( f(x) = x \).

Since the program lacks the core implementation needed to compute the desired output, it will not function correctly for any input according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect. 

For example, if we input `20 30 40 50 0 100`, the expected output is `20`, but the program will not provide any output or perform any calculations to arrive at that result. This confirms that the program does not work as required.
