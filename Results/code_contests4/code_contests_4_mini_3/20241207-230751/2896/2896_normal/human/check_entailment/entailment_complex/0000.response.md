Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem requires the function to compute the number of integers \( x \) in the range \([a; b]\) such that the probability that \( f(x) = x \) for at least 7 permutations of the numbers \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \) is true. 

However, the annotated program only reads the input values into variables but does not perform any calculations or return any output. Thus, it fails to count the integers \( x \) that meet the specified condition, effectively leaving the task incomplete. 

In summary, the program does not implement the required logic to check the conditions or count valid integers, which is explicitly needed according to the problem description. Hence, it is incorrect.
