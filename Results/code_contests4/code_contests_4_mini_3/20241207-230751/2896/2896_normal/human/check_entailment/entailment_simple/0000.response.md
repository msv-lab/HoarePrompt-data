Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not implement the logic necessary to solve the problem described. The problem requires counting the number of integers \( x \) in the range \([a; b]\) such that the probability that \( f(x) = x \) is not less than \( 31.4159265352718281828459045\% \). Specifically, this means that there should be at least 7 permutations of the four distinct integers \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \) such that \( f(x) = x \).

However, the provided program only reads the input values and does not contain any logic to:

1. Generate all permutations of the four numbers.
2. Calculate the function \( f(x) \) for these permutations.
3. Count how many integers \( x \) satisfy the condition \( f(x) = x \) for at least 7 permutations.

Since the program lacks these critical components, it fails to fulfill the problem requirements, making it incorrect.
