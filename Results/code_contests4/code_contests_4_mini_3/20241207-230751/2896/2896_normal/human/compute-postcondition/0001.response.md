The function `func` accepts the parameters `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`, which are distinct integers in the range [1, 1000]. It also accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers satisfying the condition 0 <= a <= b <= 31415. The function does not return any output as specified in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four distinct integers within a specific range and two non-negative integers within defined limits, but it does not produce any return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts four distinct integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 in the range [1, 1000], and two non-negative integers a and b such that 0 <= a <= b <= 31415, without returning any output.**
