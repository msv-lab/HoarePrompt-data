#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), k is an integer (0 or 1), and each of the n arrays contains m integers where each integer x satisfies 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and currently has no implementation, so it does not perform any operations or return any values. It is intended to operate on predefined internal values and structures, but since the function body is empty, it does not fulfill any functionality at this moment.
