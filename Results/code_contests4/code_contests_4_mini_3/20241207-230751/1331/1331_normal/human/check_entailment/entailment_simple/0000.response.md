Correctness: **False**

The program does not implement any functionality to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1()` simply contains a `pass` statement, which means it does nothing. The problem description requires a specific sequence of operations to sort n arrays based on pairs of indices, but the provided code does not contain any logic to achieve this. 

To illustrate why it is incorrect, the problem requires generating a list of index pairs `(i, j)` that can be used to sort the arrays either in ascending or descending order. However, there is no implementation in the provided code to:

1. Accept input for the number of arrays `n`, the size of each array `m`, and the sorting order `k`.
2. Process the arrays to determine which pairs of indices should be swapped to sort the arrays.
3. Output the size of the array of index pairs and the pairs themselves.

Without these components, the function cannot meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. Thus, the program is not correct.
