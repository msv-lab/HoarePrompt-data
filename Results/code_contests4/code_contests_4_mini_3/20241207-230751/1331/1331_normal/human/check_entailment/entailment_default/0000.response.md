Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The provided code does not implement any functionality, as the function `func_1()` is currently empty (it uses `pass`), meaning it does not perform any operations or produce any output. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to find pairs of indices to sort multiple arrays based on specified criteria, but since there is no implementation, it cannot handle any cases or provide a valid output.

Moreover, the output hints indicate that the function accepts no parameters and has no implementation, which confirms that it does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. There are no operations performed to sort the arrays or generate the required index pairs, which means the function is not capable of correctly addressing the problem in any scenario. Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for any potential case.
