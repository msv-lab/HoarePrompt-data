Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1()` is empty and does not implement any logic to sort the arrays according to the specified conditions (either ascending or descending order). 

The problem description requires the program to generate an array of index pairs that can be used to sort all given arrays simultaneously. However, since the function has no implementation, it cannot generate any pairs of indices or perform any sorting operations. Therefore, the program fails to meet the criteria outlined in the problem description.

In summary, as the function does not perform any operations and is not capable of achieving the intended sorting of the arrays, it does not satisfy the requirements laid out in the problem description.
