The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It operates on internal data structures, specifically `n` which is a positive integer that must be between 1 and 1000, `m` which is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `k` which is an integer that can either be 0 or 1. Additionally, it processes `n` arrays, where each array contains `m` integers, and each integer `x` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6. The function does not return a direct output related to its parameters as it lacks explicit return statements in the provided context. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined based solely on its parameters and output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates on predefined internal values and structures. Its specific output is not described in the provided context.**
