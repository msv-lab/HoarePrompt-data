Correctness: **False**.

The program does not implement any logic to find the required pairs of indices for sorting the arrays. The function `func_1()` is defined but does nothing (it simply passes), which means it does not generate any output or perform any operations as specified in the problem description. 

For example, if we take the input:

```
2 5 0
1 3 2 5 4
1 4 3 2 5
```

The expected output would be a series of index pairs that can be used to sort the arrays in ascending order. Since the program does not provide any pairs, it fails to meet the requirements. Thus, the program is incomplete and incorrect.
