Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not implemented at all, as it simply contains a `pass` statement in the function `func_1()`. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which demands a method for sorting `n` arrays based on the specified conditions.

Since the program does not contain any logic to generate pairs of indices for swapping elements in the arrays, it cannot handle any input nor produce output as specified. For instance, if we take the first provided example:

```
Input:
2 5 0
1 3 2 5 4
1 4 3 2 5
```

The program would not sort the arrays and would not produce any output, thus failing to meet the problem's requirements.

In conclusion, the absence of functional code leads to it being incorrect.
