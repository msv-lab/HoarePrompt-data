You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N balls in a two-dimensional plane. The i-th ball is at coordinates (x_i, y_i).

We will collect all of these balls, by choosing two integers p and q such that p \neq 0 or q \neq 0 and then repeating the following operation:

* Choose a ball remaining in the plane and collect it. Let (a, b) be the coordinates of this ball. If we collected a ball at coordinates (a - p, b - q) in the previous operation, the cost of this operation is 0. Otherwise, including when this is the first time to do this operation, the cost of this operation is 1.



Find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls when we optimally choose p and q.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* |x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9
* If i \neq j, x_i \neq x_j or y_i \neq y_j.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    N = read_int()
    balls = []
    for _ in range(N):
        balls.append(read_int_array())
    func_8(func_2(N, balls))
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function reads an integer N (1 <= N <= 50) and then reads N distinct pairs of integers representing coordinates (x_i, y_i) for each ball. It does not return any value directly but processes the data by calling other functions, specifically `func_2` with N and the list of balls, and subsequently calls `func_8` with the result of `func_2`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly and relies on the assumption that inputs are valid as per the constraints given.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, balls):
    bdict = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for (x, y) in balls:
        bdict[x].add(y)

    tried = set()
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            (p, q) = (balls[j][0] - balls[i][0], balls[j][1] - balls[i][1])
            if (p, q) not in tried:
                tried.add((p, q))
                tried.add((-p, -q))
                points = score(p, q)
                if points < ans:
                    ans = points
    return ans
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) and a list of tuples `balls`, each representing the coordinates of a ball. It computes and returns the minimum score obtained from the `score(p, q)` function for all valid pairs of balls, where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates of the chosen pairs of balls. The function utilizes a set to track unique directional vectors to avoid redundant calculations. However, the specific implementation and logic of the `score(p, q)` function are not provided, which means the actual scoring mechanism is not clear from the code alone. The potential edge cases regarding the behavior of `score(p, q)` are not addressed in the summary, as they depend on the implementation of that function.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def score(p, q):
    out = n
    for (x, y) in balls:
        (nx, ny) = (x + p, y + q)
        if ny in bdict.get(nx, []):
            out -= 1
    return out
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts two integer parameters `p` and `q` (both not equal to 0) and returns an integer value `out`, which is calculated by subtracting `k` (the count of occurrences of `ny`, the new y-coordinate of balls shifted by `q`, in the list corresponding to `nx`, the new x-coordinate of balls shifted by `p`) from `n`, the total number of balls. The function effectively counts how many balls have their new y-coordinates corresponding to the new x-coordinate after the shifts, and subtracts this count from the total.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    if False and 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' in os.environ:
        func_4()
    else:
        func_1()
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and executes `func_1()` unconditionally, as the condition for calling `func_4()` is always false. The function likely processes data related to the positions of balls represented by their coordinates, but it does not define or return any specific values. The behavior of `func_1()` and `func_4()` is unknown.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    solution = solve
    test_inputs = None
    test_outputs = None
    judge = None
    slow_solution = None
    if solution is not None:
        if test_outputs is not None:
            func_5(solution, test_inputs, test_outputs)
        if judge is not None:
            func_6(solution, test_inputs, judge)
        if slow_solution is not None:
            func_7(solution, test_inputs, slow_solution)
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts an integer parameter `N` (where 1 <= N <= 50), and it checks for the presence of various inputs (`solution`, `test_inputs`, `test_outputs`, `judge`, and `slow_solution`). It calls different functions (`func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7`) based on whether these inputs are not None. However, it does not return any value or produce an output based on the annotations. The function mainly serves as a control structure to invoke other functions if certain conditions are met, but the actual handling of `test_inputs` and the output from those functions is not defined within this function.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(solution, inputs_answers):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)
    for (args, test_ans) in inputs_answers:
        ans = solution(*args.copy())

        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts an integer `solution`, which is expected to be a callable, and a list of tuples `inputs_answers`, where each tuple contains arguments for the `solution` function and the expected output. It tests the `solution` function with each set of arguments, comparing the actual output to the expected output. The function counts the number of incorrect answers and logs the results, indicating if all tests passed or showing how many tests failed. The function does not return any value; it only logs the outcomes of the tests.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(solution, inputs_gen, judge):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)
    for args in inputs_gen:

            func_8('WRONG! ans=%s, args=%s' % (ans, args))
            wrong += 1
        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a solution function, an input generator function, and a judging function. It tests the solution function against a series of input values generated by the input generator. For each test, it evaluates the solution's output using the judging function and counts the number of failed tests. After all tests, it logs a message indicating whether all tests passed or how many tests failed. It does not handle or report on cases where the input generator does not yield any inputs, nor does it specify the behavior if the solution function raises an exception during execution.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(solution, inputs_gen, solution_slow):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)
    for args in inputs_gen:
        ans = solution(*deepcopy(args))

        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a callable `solution`, a generator `inputs_gen` that yields arguments for testing, and a callable `solution_slow`. It executes the `solution` and `solution_slow` with each set of arguments from `inputs_gen`, comparing their outputs. It counts how many times the outputs differ and logs a message indicating the total tests run and how many were incorrect. If no wrong answers occur, it indicates that all tests passed. The function handles cases where `inputs_gen` may be empty, resulting in zero tests conducted.

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts a variable number of arguments in the form of a tuple `args`, which can contain coordinates of balls as pairs of integers.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
