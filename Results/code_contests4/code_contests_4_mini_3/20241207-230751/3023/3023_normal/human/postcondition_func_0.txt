The function reads an integer N (1 <= N <= 50) and then reads N distinct pairs of integers representing coordinates (x_i, y_i) for each ball. It does not return any value directly but processes the data by calling other functions, specifically `func_2` with N and the list of balls, and subsequently calls `func_8` with the result of `func_2`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly and relies on the assumption that inputs are valid as per the constraints given.
