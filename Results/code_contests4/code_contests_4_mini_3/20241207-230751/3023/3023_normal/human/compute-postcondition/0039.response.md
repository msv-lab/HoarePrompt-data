According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i`. The range for the loop is set to `i`, meaning the loop will execute `i` times. Given the current state, `i` is 1, so the loop will execute only once.

To have the loop execute a second time, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be at least 2. Therefore, we can set `i` to 2. Since `n` is not directly affecting the loop execution but is within the range of 1 to 50, it does not need to be changed for the loop execution context.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 2, `tried` is empty, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 1**
