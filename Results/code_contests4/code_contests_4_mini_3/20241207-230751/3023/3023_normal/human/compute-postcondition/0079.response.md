`tried` is updated to include the new pair `(p, q)`, which is computed as `balls[3][0] - balls[3][0]` and `balls[3][1] - balls[3][1]`. Since both expressions evaluate to `0`, `p` and `q` are both `0`. The `tried` set now contains the pair `(0, 0)`, which was already present. Thus, the state of `tried` remains the same, as it cannot have duplicate entries. Other variables are unchanged, and the loop cannot execute again.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` contains the pair (0, 0); `points` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; and the loop cannot execute again.**
