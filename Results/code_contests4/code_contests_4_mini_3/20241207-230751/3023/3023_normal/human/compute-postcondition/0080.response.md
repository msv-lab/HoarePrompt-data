The code snippet `tried.add((-p, -q))` adds a new pair to the set `tried`. The current values of `p` and `q` are both 0. Therefore, `(-p, -q)` evaluates to `(0, 0)`. Since `tried` already contains the pair `(0, 0)`, adding it again does not change its state. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `points`, `ans`) remain unchanged, and no additional actions are triggered as the loop cannot execute again.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` still contains the pair (0, 0); `points` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged.**
