According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. However, since `j` is currently equal to `i`, the loop cannot execute again. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be greater than `j`. Since `j` is 3, `i` needs to be at least 4. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 3.**
