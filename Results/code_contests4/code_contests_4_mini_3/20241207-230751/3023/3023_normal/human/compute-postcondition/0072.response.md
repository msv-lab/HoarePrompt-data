The variable `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, where `p` is 0 and `q` is 0. Since the specific implementation of the function `score` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `points`. However, the value of `p` and `q` does not change and the set `tried` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the known values of the variables and indicates that the value of `points` is derived from the function call.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` contains (0, 0); `points` is the result of score(0, 0)**
