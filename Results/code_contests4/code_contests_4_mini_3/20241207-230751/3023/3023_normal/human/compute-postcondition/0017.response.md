`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The value of `x` is taken from `args`, which has at least 2 elements, so `x` has a defined value. The previous states of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` has at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in `args`; and `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` has at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in `args`; `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file.**
