According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, changing its value to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 1, `tried` is empty, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
