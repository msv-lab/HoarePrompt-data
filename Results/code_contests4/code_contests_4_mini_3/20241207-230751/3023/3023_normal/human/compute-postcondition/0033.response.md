The variable `points` is assigned the value returned from the function `score(p, q)`. The values of `p` and `q` are used as inputs to this function, and since `points` is affected by the output of `score(p, q)`, we can state that `points` now holds the score calculated based on these inputs. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 1; `tried` now contains the tuple (p, q) added and the new tuple (-p, -q); `points` is the score of function `score(p, q)`; `ans` is the current minimum score; `j` is not less than 1, so the assignment does not occur.
