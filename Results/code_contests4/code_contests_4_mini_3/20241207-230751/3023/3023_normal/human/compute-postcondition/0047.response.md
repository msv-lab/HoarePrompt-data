Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to be equal to `points`, `i` remains 2, and `tried` contains the tuple `(p, q)` as well as the tuple `(-p, -q)`; `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`.***
