The `tried` variable is a set that will now include the tuple `(p, q)`, which means a new entry is added to the set. The values of `n`, `i`, `points`, `ans`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the tuple `(p, q)` has been added to `tried`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 1; `tried` now contains the tuple (p, q) added; `points` is assigned from the function score(p, q); `ans` is the current minimum score; `j` is not less than 1, so the assignment does not occur.**
