The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. The value of `points` was previously assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the previous values of the affected variables do not change, and we don't have specific values for `points` or `ans`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `tried` includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`; `ans` is assigned the value of `points` which is returned by `score(p, q)`**
