Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `i` is 3, `tried` is a set, and `ans` is initialized to a value.

Code of the loop:
```
for j in range(i):
    p, q = balls[j][0] - balls[i][0], balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]
    if (p, q) not in tried:
        tried.add((p, q))
        tried.add((-p, -q))
        points = score(p, q)
        if points < ans:
            ans = points
```

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 0; `p` is `balls[0][0] - balls[3][0]`; `q` is `balls[0][1] - balls[3][1]`; if the pair `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, then `tried` will include `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`, and `points` will be assigned the result of `score(p, q)`. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` will be updated to `points`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 1; `p` is `balls[1][0] - balls[3][0]`; `q` is `balls[1][1] - balls[3][1]`; if the pair `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, then `tried` will include `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` will be assigned the result of `score(p, q)`. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` will be updated to `points`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 2; `p` is `balls[2][0] - balls[3][0]`; `q` is `balls[2][1] - balls[3][1]`; if the pair `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, then `tried` will include `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` will be assigned the result of `score(p, q)`. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` will be updated to `points`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Final Output State after the loop has finished executing all iterations: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` has completed all iterations (0 to 2); `tried` contains all pairs generated from `(balls[j][0] - balls[3][0], balls[j][1] - balls[3][1])` for `j` in [0, 1, 2] and their negations; `ans` is the minimum value obtained from the scores calculated during the loop execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `tried` contains all unique pairs generated, and `ans` is the minimum score calculated from the pairs processed.**
