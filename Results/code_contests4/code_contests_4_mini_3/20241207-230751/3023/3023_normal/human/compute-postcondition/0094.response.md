Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the function `score(p, q)` for all valid pairs of balls; `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and their negations for each unique pair of balls considered; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `i-1` at the last iteration; `p` and `q` are defined based on the last pair of balls processed.**
