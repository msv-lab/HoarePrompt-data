The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `balls`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50. The parameter `balls` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of a ball, with |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9, and all balls have unique coordinates. After executing the function body, it returns the minimum score obtained from the function `score(p, q)` for all valid pairs of balls processed, represented by the variable `ans`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of tuples `balls`, and returns the minimum score obtained from the function `score(p, q)` for all valid pairs of balls.**
