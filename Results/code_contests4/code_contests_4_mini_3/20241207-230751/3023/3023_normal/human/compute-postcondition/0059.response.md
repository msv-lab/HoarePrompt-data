Given the initial state, we have:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50
- `i` is 2
- `j` must be 2
- `p` and `q` are assigned the values of `balls[2][0] - balls[2][0]` and `balls[2][1] - balls[2][1]`, respectively. Since `balls[2][0]` and `balls[2][1]` are both subtracted from themselves, both `p` and `q` will be 0.

Now, the line of code `tried.add((p, q))` will add the tuple `(p, q)` to the set `tried`. Since `p` and `q` are both 0, the tuple being added is `(0, 0)`.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and we are only modifying the set `tried` by adding a new tuple.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` now includes the tuple (0, 0).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` now includes the tuple (0, 0)**
