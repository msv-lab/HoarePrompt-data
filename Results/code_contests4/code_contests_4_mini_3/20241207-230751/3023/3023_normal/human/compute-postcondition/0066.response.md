According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3**
