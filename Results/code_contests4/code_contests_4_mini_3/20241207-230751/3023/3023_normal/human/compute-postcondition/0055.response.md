Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`, `i` remains 2, `tried` includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`, and `points` is assigned the value of `score(p, q)`. There is no change to `ans`, `i`, `tried`, or `points` if `points` is not less than `ans`.***
