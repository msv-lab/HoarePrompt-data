Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` still contains the pair (0, 0); `points` is updated to score(0, 0). If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If the pair (0, 0) was already in `tried`, then the values of `p`, `q`, `tried`, `points`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
