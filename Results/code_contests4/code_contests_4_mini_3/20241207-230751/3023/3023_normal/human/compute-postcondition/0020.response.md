Output State: **`sep` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; if `args` has at least one element, `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`; if `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`; `file` writes the value from `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, which is either the value of 'end' in `kwargs` or defaults to a newline character.**
