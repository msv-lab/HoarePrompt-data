Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. If the tuple `(p, q)` was not in `tried`, and if `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `points`, `i` remains 2, `tried` includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`, and `points` is assigned the value of `score(p, q)`. If `points` is not less than `ans`, there are no changes to `ans`, `i`, `tried`, or `points`.***
