The code `tried.add((p, q))` adds the tuple `(p, q)` to the set `tried`. The values of `p` and `q` are derived from the differences of the elements in `balls`, but since they are not specifically provided in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that `tried` is a set, and adding a new tuple will change its contents if `(p, q)` is not already present in `tried`. 

The values of `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged, while the content of `tried` may or may not change depending on whether `(p, q)` is already in the set. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `tried` now includes the tuple `(p, q)`**.
