According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop is set to iterate `i` times, and since `i` is 3, the values of `j` will range from 0 to 2 during its execution. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, which means the loop has completed its iterations (0, 1, 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to increment to 3, but since the loop is limited to `i`, and `i` has not changed, it cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` contains the pair (0, 0); `points` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged. The loop cannot execute again.**
