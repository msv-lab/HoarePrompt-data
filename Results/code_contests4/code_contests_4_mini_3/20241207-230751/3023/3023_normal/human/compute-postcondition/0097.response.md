Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) and a list of tuples `balls`, each representing the coordinates of a ball. It computes and returns the minimum score obtained from the `score(p, q)` function for all valid pairs of balls, where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates of the chosen pairs of balls. The function utilizes a set to track unique directional vectors to avoid redundant calculations. However, the specific implementation and logic of the `score(p, q)` function are not provided, which means the actual scoring mechanism is not clear from the code alone. The potential edge cases regarding the behavior of `score(p, q)` are not addressed in the summary, as they depend on the implementation of that function.**
