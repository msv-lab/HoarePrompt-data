The code `tried.add((p, q))` adds the tuple `(p, q)` to the set `tried`. The current values of `p` and `q` are both 0, so the tuple being added is `(0, 0)`. In the initial state, we are given that the tuple `(0, 0)` is not already in the set `tried`, which means it will be successfully added.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; and the tuple (0, 0) has been added to the set `tried`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; and the tuple (0, 0) has been added to the set `tried`.**
