The `tried` set has the tuple (-p, -q) added to it. The previous values of `tried` are now updated to include this new tuple. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `points`, `ans`, and `j`) remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 1; `tried` now contains the tuple (p, q) added and the new tuple (-p, -q); `points` is assigned from the function score(p, q); `ans` is the current minimum score; `j` is not less than 1, so the assignment does not occur.
