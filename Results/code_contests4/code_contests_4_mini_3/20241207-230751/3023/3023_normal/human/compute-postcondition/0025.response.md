Functionality: ** The function accepts a variable number of arguments in the form of a tuple `args`, which can contain coordinates of balls as pairs of integers. It prints these values to a specified output stream, with customizable separators and an ending character. If no arguments are provided, it writes nothing to the output. The function defaults to printing to standard output and ends with a newline unless specified otherwise. The function does not explicitly handle any cases where `args` may exceed a length of 50, but it allows for up to 50 pairs of integers representing the coordinates.**
