According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again for that next element. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, indicating that we are not at the beginning of the loop, and `x` has been written to `file`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next value in `args`, and `at_start` will still be False since the loop would have executed previously.

State: **`sep` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to sys.stdout; for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `args`, and `at_start` is still False.**
