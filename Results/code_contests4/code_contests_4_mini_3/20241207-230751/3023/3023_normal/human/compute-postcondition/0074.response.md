The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. The previous value of `points` is known and is less than `ans`. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will hold the value of `points`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` contains (0, 0); `points` is the result of score(0, 0), and `points` is less than `ans`; `ans` is assigned the value of `points`.**
