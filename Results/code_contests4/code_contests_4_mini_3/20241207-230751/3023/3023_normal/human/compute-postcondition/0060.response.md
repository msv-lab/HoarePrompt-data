The `tried` set is updated to include the tuple `(-p, -q)`. The current values of `p` and `q` are both 0, so `(-p, -q)` evaluates to `(0, 0)`. Since the tuple `(0, 0)` is already included in the `tried` set, adding it again does not change the set. Therefore, the output state reflects that `tried` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` includes the tuple (0, 0) and remains unchanged.**
