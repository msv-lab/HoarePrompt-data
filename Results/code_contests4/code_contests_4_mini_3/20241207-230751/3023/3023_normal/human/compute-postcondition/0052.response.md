The tuple `(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried`. The values of `p` and `q` are not specified, but the addition of this tuple will alter the `tried` set by including these negative values. The other variables `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `tried` now includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `tried` now includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`**
