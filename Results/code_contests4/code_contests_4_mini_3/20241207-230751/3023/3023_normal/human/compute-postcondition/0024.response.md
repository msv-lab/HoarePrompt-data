The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `args`. `args` is a tuple of length N, where each element is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the balls. N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50. The function does not have any specified return value in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a tuple of pairs of integers representing coordinates of balls, but it does not return any output based on the given details.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter args, which is a tuple of length N containing pairs of integers representing coordinates of the balls, where 1 <= N <= 50.**
