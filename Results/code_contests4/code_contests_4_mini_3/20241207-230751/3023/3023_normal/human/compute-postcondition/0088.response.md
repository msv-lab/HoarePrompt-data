The `tried` set is being modified by adding a tuple `(-p, -q)`. The values of `p` and `q` are derived from the previously defined values of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`. Since `i` and `j` are both 3, `p` and `q` will be calculated based on `balls[3]`. 

Since we do not have specific values for `balls[3]`, we cannot determine the exact values of `p` and `q`. However, we know that `(-p, -q)` will be added to the set `tried`.

Therefore, the impact of this code on the program is that the `tried` set will include the negated values of `p` and `q`, while the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3, `j` is 3; `tried` now includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`**.
