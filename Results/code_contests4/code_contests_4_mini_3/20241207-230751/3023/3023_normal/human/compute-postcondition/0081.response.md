The variable `points` is assigned the value of `score(p, q)`. The values of `p` and `q` are both 0. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `points` based on the function `score(0, 0)`. Since the specific implementation of `score` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact output. However, we know that `points` will be updated accordingly without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` still contains the pair (0, 0); `points` is updated to score(0, 0); `ans` remains unchanged.**
