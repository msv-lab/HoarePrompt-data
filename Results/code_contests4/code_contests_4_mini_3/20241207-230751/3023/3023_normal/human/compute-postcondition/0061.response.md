The `points` variable is assigned the value of `score(p, q)`. The values of `p` and `q` are both 0. The function `score` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot calculate the specific output value of `points`. However, we can state that `points` is determined by the function `score` applied to the current values of `p` and `q`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; `tried` includes the tuple (0, 0); `points` is determined by the function `score(0, 0)`**.
