According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `j` will iterate from 0 to `i-1`, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than the current value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means `j` has iterated through 0 and 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, `i` must still be 2 since it hasn't changed, and `j` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be 2**
