Postcondition: ***`sep` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` has at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`.***
