The variable `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`. The values of `p` and `q` are not defined in the initial state, but they are likely derived from `tried`, which includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`. Therefore, the output state cannot specify the exact values for `points`, `p`, or `q`, but it can mention the function call and the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `tried` includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`; `points` is assigned the value returned by `score(p, q)`**.
