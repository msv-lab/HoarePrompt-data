Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 1; `tried` contains the tuple (p, q) and the new tuple (-p, -q) is added. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`; `j` remains not less than 1, so no assignment occurs. If (p, q) was already in tried, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
