According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is currently 3, the loop will execute 3 times, with `j` taking values 0, 1, and 2. The condition for the loop to execute for a third time is already satisfied as `i` is equal to 3. 

At the end of the second iteration of the loop, `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute for the third time, `j` will be incremented to 3. Since `n` is not directly influencing the loop execution in this context, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to run three times; it only needs to be considered if there are other dependencies outside of this snippet.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time**
