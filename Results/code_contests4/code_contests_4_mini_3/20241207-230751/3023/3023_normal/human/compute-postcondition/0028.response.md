Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 1; `p` and `q` are calculated as balls[j][0] - balls[i][0] and balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]; if the tuple (p, q) was not previously in `tried`, then `tried` now contains the tuple (p, q) and is updated to include the tuple (-p, -q); `points` is assigned the value returned from the function `score(p, q)`; if `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. If (p, q) was already in `tried`, no changes occur to `tried` or `ans`.***
