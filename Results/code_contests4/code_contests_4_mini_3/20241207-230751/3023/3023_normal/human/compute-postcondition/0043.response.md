The `tried` set is modified to include the tuple `(-p, -q)`. The values of `p` and `q` are calculated based on the previously defined values from the `balls` list, but these values are not specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the new tuple to the `tried` set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 2, `tried` now contains the tuple `(p, q)` and the tuple `(-p, -q)` has been added.**
