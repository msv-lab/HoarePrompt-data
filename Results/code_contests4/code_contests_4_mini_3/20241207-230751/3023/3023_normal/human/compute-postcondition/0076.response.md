Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; if the pair (p, q) which is (0, 0) is not in `tried`, then `points` is assigned the result of `score(0, 0)`. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `points`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
