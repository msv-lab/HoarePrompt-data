The code `tried.add((-p, -q))` adds the tuple `(-p, -q)` to the set `tried`. The current values of `p` and `q` are both 0. Therefore, `-p` is 0 and `-q` is also 0, resulting in the tuple (0, 0) being added to the set. Since (0, 0) is already in the set `tried`, adding it again does not change the set.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `p` is 0; `q` is 0; and the set `tried` remains unchanged as it still contains (0, 0).**
