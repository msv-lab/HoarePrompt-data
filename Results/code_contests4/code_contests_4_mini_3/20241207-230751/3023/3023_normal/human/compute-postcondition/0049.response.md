According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the loop has executed twice for `j` values 0 and 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 2, and `i` must remain 2. 

Since `j` will now equal `i`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, no changes will occur to `ans`, `tried`, or `points`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be equal to `i` which is 2.**
