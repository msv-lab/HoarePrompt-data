Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. If `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, and if `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `points`, `i` remains 2, and `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`. Otherwise, if `(p, q)` is in `tried`, no changes are made to `ans`, `i`, or `tried`.***
