According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i`. Since `i` is 1, the loop iterates over the range of `j` which goes from 0 to `i-1`, which means `j` can only take the value 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1, but since `i` is 1, the range for `j` will not allow for another iteration (it would require `j` to be less than `i`).

Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because `j` has reached its maximum value, which is equal to `i`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 1; `tried` contains the tuple (p, q); `points` is assigned from the function score(p, q); `ans` is the current minimum score; for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1 (which is not possible)**
