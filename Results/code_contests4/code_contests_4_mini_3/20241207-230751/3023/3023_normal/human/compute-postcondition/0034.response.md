The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `tried`, `points`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `i` is 1; `tried` now contains the tuple (p, q) added and the new tuple (-p, -q); `points` is the score of function `score(p, q)`; `ans` is now equal to `points`; `j` is not less than 1, so the assignment does not occur.
