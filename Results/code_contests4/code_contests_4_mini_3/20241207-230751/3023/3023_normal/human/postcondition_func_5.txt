The function accepts an integer `solution`, which is expected to be a callable, and a list of tuples `inputs_answers`, where each tuple contains arguments for the `solution` function and the expected output. It tests the `solution` function with each set of arguments, comparing the actual output to the expected output. The function counts the number of incorrect answers and logs the results, indicating if all tests passed or showing how many tests failed. The function does not return any value; it only logs the outcomes of the tests.
