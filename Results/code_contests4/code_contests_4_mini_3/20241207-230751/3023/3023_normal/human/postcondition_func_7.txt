The function accepts a callable `solution`, a generator `inputs_gen` that yields arguments for testing, and a callable `solution_slow`. It executes the `solution` and `solution_slow` with each set of arguments from `inputs_gen`, comparing their outputs. It counts how many times the outputs differ and logs a message indicating the total tests run and how many were incorrect. If no wrong answers occur, it indicates that all tests passed. The function handles cases where `inputs_gen` may be empty, resulting in zero tests conducted.
