solution is a function that takes in a list of integers representing coordinates of balls in a two-dimensional plane, where each ball's position is given as a pair (x_i, y_i) with 1 <= N <= 50 and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9; inputs_gen is a function that generates input values, and judge is a function that evaluates the output of solution.
