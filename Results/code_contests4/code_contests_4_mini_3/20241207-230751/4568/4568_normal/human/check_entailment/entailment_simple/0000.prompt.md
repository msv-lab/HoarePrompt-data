You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with strings for two players.

Given a group of n non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.

Andrew and Alex decided to play this game k times. The player who is the loser of the i-th game makes the first move in the (i + 1)-th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last (k-th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.

Input

The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Each of the next n lines contains a single non-empty string from the given group. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed 105. Each string of the group consists only of lowercase English letters.

Output

If the player who moves first wins, print "First", otherwise print "Second" (without the quotes).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (inclusive), and the subsequent n lines each contain a non-empty string composed solely of lowercase English letters, with the total length of all strings not exceeding 100,000.
def func_1(node, level):
    if (node is not None and node.isWord) :
        if (level % 2 == 1) :
            return True, False
            #The program returns a tuple with True and False
        else :
            return False, True
            #The program returns the tuple (False, True)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (inclusive), and the subsequent `n` lines each contain a non-empty string composed solely of lowercase English letters, with the total length of all strings not exceeding 100,000. The variable `node` is either None or `node` is not a word (i.e., `node.isWord` is False).
    nodes = node.childs
    odd_ret = False
    even_ret = False
    for it in nodes:
        child = nodes.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, level + 1)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_ret = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_ret = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node` is not None, `nodes` contains at least N elements, `odd_ret` is True if any `odd_w` was True during the iterations, `even_ret` is True if any `even_w` was True during the iterations, where N is the number of elements processed in the loop.
    return odd_ret, even_ret
    #The program returns the values of odd_ret and even_ret, indicating whether any odd_w or even_w was True during the iterations, respectively.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ttree is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, total length of all strings does not exceed 10^5) and the second element is an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
def func_2(ttree):
    canloss = False
    canwin = False
    node = ttree.root.childs
    for it in node:
        child = node.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, 0)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_w = True
        
        if even_w == True:

            canwin = True
        
        if odd_w:
            canloss = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings and the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is True if any child led to an odd win; `canwin` is True if any child led to an even win; `node` is assigned all children from `ttree.root.childs`; `child` is assigned the last value of `node.get(it)` for the last iteration; `odd_w` is True if at least one child led to an odd win; `even_w` is True if at least one child led to an even win.
    if (canloss and canwin) :
        return 3
        #The program returns 3
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings and the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is True if any child led to an odd win; `canwin` is True if any child led to an even win; `node` is assigned all children from `ttree.root.childs`; `child` is assigned the last value of `node.get(it)` for the last iteration; `odd_w` is True if at least one child led to an odd win; `even_w` is True if at least one child led to an even win; either `canloss` is False or `canwin` is False (or both).
    if canloss :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings and the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is False; `canwin` is True if any child led to an even win; `node` is assigned all children from `ttree.root.childs`; `child` is assigned the last value of `node.get(it)` for the last iteration; `odd_w` is True if at least one child led to an odd win; `even_w` is True if at least one child led to an even win; either `canloss` is False or `canwin` is True, ensuring that `canloss` is specifically False.
    return 2
    #The program returns the integer 2


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
