#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a `node` that represents a tree structure and an integer `level`. It recursively checks if any child nodes are marked as words, returning a tuple indicating whether any of the child nodes at odd levels contain words (the first element of the tuple) and whether any of the child nodes at even levels contain words (the second element of the tuple). If the input node is not a word, the function will return (False, False). The function handles cases where the node is None or has no children appropriately, and the resulting tuple reflects the presence of words at odd and even levels among the child nodes.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `ttree` consisting of a list of `n` non-empty strings and an integer `k`. It evaluates child nodes to determine if any lead to an 'odd win' or 'even win'. The function returns 3 if there are both odd and even wins, returns 1 if there are only odd wins, and returns 2 if there are only even wins. It does not handle cases where `ttree` might not have any children, which could lead to potential errors or unintended behavior.
