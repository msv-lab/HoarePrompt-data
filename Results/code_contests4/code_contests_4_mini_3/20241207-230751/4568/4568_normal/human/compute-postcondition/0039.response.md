Postcondition: ***`child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`; `ttree` remains unchanged; `canloss` is True; `canwin` is True; `node` remains an iterable from `ttree.root.childs; `it` is updated to point to the next element in `node`; if `odd_w` is True, then `even_w` is assigned the value True; if `even_w` was already True, it remains True.***
