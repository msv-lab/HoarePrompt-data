The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `ttree`. `ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of `n` non-empty strings (with the constraint that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and the total length of all strings does not exceed \(10^5\)), and the second element is an integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)). 

After executing the function body, there are three possible cases for the return value:
- Case_1: The function returns the integer 3.
- Case_2: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case_3: The function returns the integer 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a tuple `ttree` containing a list of non-empty strings and an integer, and it returns one of three integers based on internal conditions met in the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter ttree, which is a tuple consisting of a list of non-empty strings and an integer, and returns one of three integers: 3, 1, or 2 based on specific conditions.**
