Postcondition: ***`ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings and the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is False; `canwin` is True if any child led to an even win; `node` is assigned all children from `ttree.root.childs`; `child` is assigned the last value of `node.get(it)` for the last iteration; `odd_w` is True if at least one child led to an odd win; `even_w` is True if at least one child led to an even win; either `canloss` is False or `canwin` is True, ensuring that `canloss` is specifically False.***
