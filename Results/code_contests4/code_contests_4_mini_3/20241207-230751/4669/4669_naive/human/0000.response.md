To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to modify a string consisting of parentheses `(` and `)` to form the shortest correct bracket sequence. The output should be the lexicographically smallest string among the shortest correct bracket sequences that can be obtained.

### Given Program:
```python
N = input()
ss = raw_input()
s = ss.split('()')
while len(s) > 1:
    s = ''.join(s)
    print(s)
    s = s.split('()')
a = ''
b = ''
s = s[0]
N = len(s)
for i in range(N):
    if s[i] == '(':
        a += ')'
    if s[i] == ')':
        b += '('
print(b + ss + a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program expects an integer followed by a string of parentheses. However, it uses `raw_input()` which is not appropriate for Python 3 (it should be `input()`).

2. **Splitting and Joining**: The use of `s.split('()')` is meant to break down the string into parts based on complete pairs of parentheses. However, this may not yield the expected behavior since `split('()')` may not function correctly if there are nested or incomplete parentheses.

3. **Building the Result**: 
   - The logic for adding unmatched parentheses seems to be incorrect. The variables `a` and `b` are intended to store the number of unmatched `(` and `)` respectively, but they are constructed in a way that does not ensure the shortest or lexicographically smallest sequence.
   - The final output concatenates `b + ss + a`, where `b` represents unmatched `(` and `a` represents unmatched `)`. This may not yield the shortest correct sequence.

### Test Case:
To illustrate a situation where the program fails:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  4
  ((
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  (())
  ```
- **Actual Output from Program**: The program would likely output `(()))` or a different incorrect format since it does not correctly calculate the balance of parentheses.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the task of forming the shortest and lexicographically smallest correct bracket sequence due to issues in logic and improper handling of parentheses.

Correctness: **False**.
