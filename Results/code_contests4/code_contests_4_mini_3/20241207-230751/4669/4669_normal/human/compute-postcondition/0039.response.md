The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, based on the described constraints, it operates on an integer `N` which must be between 1 and 100, and a string `S` of length `N` that consists solely of the characters '(' and ')'. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. 

To summarize the functionality based on the constraints and relationships:

Functionality: **The function processes an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting only of '(' and ')', but the specific return value or behavior of the function is not detailed in the output information provided.**
