The variable `a` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `')'`. Since `a` is initially an empty string, after execution, `a` will be `')'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `S` remains unchanged, `s` is the first element of the split list, `a` is `')'`, `b` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is an opening parenthesis '('.
