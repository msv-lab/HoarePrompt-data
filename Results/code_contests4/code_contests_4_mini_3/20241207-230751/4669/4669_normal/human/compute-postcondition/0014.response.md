The variable `s` is modified by splitting its current value at the occurrences of the string `'()'`, resulting in a list of substrings. While `N` is a string representation of an integer and `S` remains unchanged, the value of `s` transforms based on its previous contents. The output state reflects this transformation.

Output State: **`N` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 to 100; `S` remains unchanged; `s` is now a list formed by splitting its previous value at '()' and printed.**
