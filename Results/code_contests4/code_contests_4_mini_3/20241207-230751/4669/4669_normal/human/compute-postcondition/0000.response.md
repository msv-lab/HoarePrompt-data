`N` is assigned the value `input()`, which accepts a string input. Since `N` is supposed to be an integer and has the constraint that it must be between 1 and 100, the value of `N` will ultimately be a string representation of an integer within that range. The variable `S` is not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`N` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 to 100; `S` remains unchanged.**
