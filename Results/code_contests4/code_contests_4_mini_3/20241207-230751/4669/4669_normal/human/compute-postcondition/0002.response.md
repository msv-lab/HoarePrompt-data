The variable `s` is assigned the result of splitting the string `ss` by the substring `()`. The initial state indicates that `S` remains unchanged and `ss` is an input string. The splitting operation creates a list where each element is a substring from `ss` that is separated by the specified delimiter `()`. The values of `N` and `S` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new list created in `s`.

Output State: **`N` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 to 100; `S` remains unchanged; `s` is a list obtained by splitting `ss` by '()'**
