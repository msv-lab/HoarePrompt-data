The code `b += '('` appends an opening parenthesis '(' to the string `b`. Since `b` is initially an empty string, after this operation, `b` will contain just one character: '('.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 0, `S` remains unchanged, `s` is the first element of the split list, `a` is set to ')', `b` is '(', `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is an opening parenthesis '(', and the character at index `i` of `s` is a closing parenthesis ')'.
