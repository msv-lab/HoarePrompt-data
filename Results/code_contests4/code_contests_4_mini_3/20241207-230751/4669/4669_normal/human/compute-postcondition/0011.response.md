According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `s`. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list of substrings formed by splitting the original `s` by '()'. 

Since `s` is currently a list of substrings, for the loop to execute one more time, it is necessary that the list `s` contains more than one substring. Therefore, `s` must have at least 2 elements.

No other states need to be adjusted as `N` is already within the specified range, and `S` remains unchanged.

State: **`N` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 to 100, `S` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `s` must contain more than 1 element**
