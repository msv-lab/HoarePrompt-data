The variable `ss` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which takes input as a string. The initial state specifies that `N` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 to 100, but it does not affect the assignment to `ss`. The value of `S` remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `ss` now holds the value entered by the user.

Output State: **`N` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 to 100; `S` remains unchanged; `ss` is an input string.**
