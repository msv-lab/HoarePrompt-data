The value of `s` is assigned the result of splitting `s` by the delimiter '()'. The previous value of `s` is not specified, but it is known to be a string formed by joining elements of `s`. The impact of the splitting operation will change the structure of `s`, creating a list of substrings based on the occurrences of '()'. The variable `N` and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 to 100, `S` remains unchanged, and `s` is now a list of substrings formed by splitting the original `s` by '()'.

Output State: **`N` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 to 100, `S` remains unchanged, `s` is now a list of substrings formed by splitting the original `s` by '()'.**
