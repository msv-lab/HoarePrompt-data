According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `N`. Since `N` is greater than 0, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, meaning that the loop has executed for the first time. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Given that `N` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `S` remains unchanged, `s` is the first element of the split list, `a` is set to ')', `b` is '(', `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
