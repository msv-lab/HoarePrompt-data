According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and we need to check if the loop can execute a second time. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 2. The loop can execute again as long as `N` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `S` remains unchanged, `s` is the first element of the split list, `a` is '(', `b` is '(', and `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2.**
