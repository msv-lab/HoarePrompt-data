The function accepts an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting only of '(' and ')'. It processes S by repeatedly removing pairs of '()' until no more can be removed. After that, it counts the remaining unmatched parentheses in S, constructing two new strings: one consisting of closing parentheses for every opening parenthesis and another consisting of opening parentheses for every closing parenthesis found in S. Finally, it prints the concatenation of the opening parentheses, the original string S, and the closing parentheses. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result.
