Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It checks if A is a divisor of B by using the modulo operation `list[1] % list[0] == 0`. If A is a divisor, it prints the sum of A and B; otherwise, it prints the result of B minus A. 

All potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 20) are handled correctly:
1. If A is 4 and B is 12, since 4 is a divisor of 12, the output is 16 (4 + 12).
2. If A is 8 and B is 20, since 8 is not a divisor of 20, the output is 12 (20 - 8).
3. If A is 1 and B is 1, since 1 is a divisor of 1, the output is 2 (1 + 1).

The program adheres to the constraints and fulfills the requirements for all cases, hence it is correct.
