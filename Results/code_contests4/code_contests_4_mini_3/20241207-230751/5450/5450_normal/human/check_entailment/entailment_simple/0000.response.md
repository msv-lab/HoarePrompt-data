Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is valid in Python 2, but not in Python 3 where `input()` should be used instead. This discrepancy can lead to runtime errors depending on the Python version used.

2. **Variable Naming**: The use of `list` as a variable name is not recommended since `list` is a built-in type in Python. This could lead to confusion or unintended behavior if the built-in `list` type is needed later in the code.

3. **Logic Verification**: The program logic seems to be correct based on the problem description; it correctly checks if `A` (list[0]) is a divisor of `B` (list[1]) and computes the appropriate output based on the condition. However, the program does not explicitly define `A` and `B` as the first and second elements of the list. This can lead to confusion about what the values represent.

4. **Edge Cases**: While the program appears to handle the described operations correctly, the implementation relies on the assumption that the inputs will always be valid integers within the specified range. If invalid inputs somehow slipped through, the program would fail.

Due to these issues, particularly the reliance on Python 2's `raw_input()` and the use of a built-in type name for a variable, the program does not fully comply with the problem description's requirements in a robust manner. Therefore, it is deemed incorrect.
