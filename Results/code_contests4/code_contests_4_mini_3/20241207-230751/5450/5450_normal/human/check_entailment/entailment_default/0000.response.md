Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
1. Given two positive integers A and B.
2. If A is a divisor of B, print A + B; otherwise, print B - A.
3. Constraints: \(1 \leq A \leq B \leq 20\).

### Program Code:
```python
list = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
if list[1] % list[0] == 0:
    print(list[0] + list[1])
else:
    print(list[1] - list[0])
```

### Output Hints:
- The function accepts two positive integers `A` and `B`, where \(1 \leq A \leq B \leq 20\).
- It prints the sum of `A` and `B` if `B` is divisible by `A`; otherwise, it prints the difference `B - A`.

### Initial Assessment:
- The program reads two integers from input and stores them in a list.
- It checks if B (list[1]) is divisible by A (list[0]).
- If true, it prints A + B; otherwise, it prints B - A.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Values**: For the smallest values, A = 1 and B = 1, the output should be 2 (since 1 is a divisor of 1).
2. **Non-Divisor Case**: Consider A = 3 and B = 5. Since 5 is not divisible by 3, the output should be B - A = 5 - 3 = 2.
3. **Divisor Case**: For A = 4 and B = 12, since 12 is divisible by 4, the output should be 4 + 12 = 16.
4. **Upper Bound**: For A = 20 and B = 20, since 20 is a divisor of itself, the output should be 20 + 20 = 40.

### Output Hints Agreement:
- The output hints correctly state that if B is divisible by A, it should print A + B, which aligns with the code logic.
- If not, it correctly states that it should print B - A, which also aligns.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and the output hints, the logic in the code matches the problem description for all potential cases within the given constraints. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle based on the description. 

Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
