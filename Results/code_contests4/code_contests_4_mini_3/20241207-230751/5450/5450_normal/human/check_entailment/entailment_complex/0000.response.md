Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `A` and `B`, from standard input, which is consistent with the problem's requirement for input format.

2. **Divisor Check**: The condition `if (list[1] % list[0] == 0)` checks whether `B` (which is `list[1]`) is divisible by `A` (which is `list[0]`). This is exactly what the problem description specifies: if `A` is a divisor of `B`.

3. **Output Logic**: 
   - If `A` is a divisor of `B`, it correctly computes `A + B` and prints it.
   - If `A` is not a divisor of `B`, it correctly computes `B - A` and prints that result.

4. **Constraints Compliance**: The function adheres to the constraints that `1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 20`. This is ensured by the problem description and the state before function execution, and as such, it does not need additional checks for the values of `A` and `B` within the function.

5. **Examples Verification**: The example outputs provided in the problem description are also correctly produced by the logic of the function:
   - For inputs `4 12`, it prints `16` (since `12` is divisible by `4`).
   - For inputs `8 20`, it prints `12` (since `20` is not divisible by `8`).
   - For inputs `1 1`, it prints `2` (since `1` is a divisor of `1`).

In conclusion, the program accurately implements the specified functionality and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is validated.
