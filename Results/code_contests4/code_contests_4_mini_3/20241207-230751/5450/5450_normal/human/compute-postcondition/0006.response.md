The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that it works with two positive integers `A` and `B` such that \(1 \leq A \leq B \leq 20\). Since there are no return statements or specific output conditions provided in the output section, we cannot determine the functionality based on the available information. Therefore, based on the given constraints, we can summarize the expected behavior as follows:

Functionality: **The function is expected to work with two positive integers A and B, where 1 <= A <= B <= 20, but the specific output or return value is not defined.**
