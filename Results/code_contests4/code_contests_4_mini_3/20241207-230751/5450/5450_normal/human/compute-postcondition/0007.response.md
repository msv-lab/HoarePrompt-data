The function `func` accepts two positive integers `A` and `B` through user input, where the conditions are that \(1 \leq A \leq B \leq 20\). It processes these integers by creating a list from the input values. If `B` (the second integer) is divisible by `A` (the first integer), it prints the sum of `A` and `B`. If not, it prints the difference between `B` and `A`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result based on the divisibility condition.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `A` and `B`, where \(1 \leq A \leq B \leq 20\), and prints the sum of `A` and `B` if `B` is divisible by `A`; otherwise, it prints the difference `B - A`. **
