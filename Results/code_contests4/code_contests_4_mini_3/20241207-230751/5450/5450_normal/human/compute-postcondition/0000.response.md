In the given task, the code snippet initializes a list by taking a space-separated input of integers and converting them to integers. The values are read from input, and since no specific input is provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the list. However, we know that A and B are positive integers within the range specified.

Since the variables A and B do not directly change, and the list is dependent on the input, the output state will reflect the relation involving A and B but will not specify the exact values of the list without knowing the input.

Output State: **A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A <= B <= 20; list is a list of integers from input.**
