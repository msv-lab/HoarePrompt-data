To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and flow of the code.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that given two positive integers A and B:
1. If A is a divisor of B, the output should be `A + B`.
2. If A is not a divisor of B, the output should be `B - A`.

### Code Analysis
```python
list = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
if list[1] % list[0] == 0:
    print(list[0] + list[1])
else:
    print(list[1] - list[0])
```

1. The code reads two integers from input and stores them in a list.
2. It checks if `list[1]` (which corresponds to B) is divisible by `list[0]` (which corresponds to A).
3. If A is a divisor of B (i.e., `B % A == 0`), it prints `A + B`.
4. Otherwise, it prints `B - A`.

### Testing Examples
Let's evaluate the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: Input `4 12`
  - A (4) is a divisor of B (12). Output should be `4 + 12 = 16`. The program outputs `16`. Correct.

- **Example 2**: Input `8 20`
  - A (8) is not a divisor of B (20). Output should be `20 - 8 = 12`. The program outputs `12`. Correct.

- **Example 3**: Input `1 1`
  - A (1) is a divisor of B (1). Output should be `1 + 1 = 2`. The program outputs `2`. Correct.

### Edge Cases
We should also consider any edge cases:
- When `A = 1` and `B = 1`: already tested and passed.
- When `A = 1` and `B = 20`: A is a divisor of B, output `1 + 20 = 21`.
- When `A = 20` and `B = 20`: A is a divisor of B, output `20 + 20 = 40`.
- When `A = 5` and `B = 10`: A is a divisor of B, output `5 + 10 = 15`.
- When `A = 3` and `B = 8`: A is not a divisor of B, output `8 - 3 = 5`.

### Conclusion
The code handles all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. Therefore, after evaluating all the above scenarios, we conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic needed to fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
