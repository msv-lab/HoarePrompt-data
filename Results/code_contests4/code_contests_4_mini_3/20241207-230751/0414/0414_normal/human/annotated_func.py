#State of the program right berfore the function call: sequence is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', oddchar is a character ('b' or 'r') representing the color for the odd positions, and evenchar is a character ('b' or 'r') representing the color for the even positions, where oddchar and evenchar are different.
def func_1(sequence, oddchar, evenchar):
    length = len(sequence)
    oddmisplaced = 0
    evenmisplaced = 0
    for i in range(length):
        if i % 2 == 0 and sequence[i] != evenchar:
            evenmisplaced = evenmisplaced + 1
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and sequence[i] != oddchar:
            oddmisplaced = oddmisplaced + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`, `oddmisplaced` is the count of characters in odd indices of `sequence` that do not match `oddchar`, `evenmisplaced` is the count of characters in even indices of `sequence` that do not match `evenchar`.
    swaps = min(evenmisplaced, oddmisplaced)
    color = abs(evenmisplaced - oddmisplaced)
    return swaps + color
    #The program returns the sum of 'swaps' and the absolute difference between 'evenmisplaced' and 'oddmisplaced'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `sequence` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', along with two different characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`. It counts the number of misplaced characters in odd and even positions of the string compared to the expected characters and calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to correct these misplacements. It then returns the total number of swaps plus the absolute difference between the counts of misplaced characters in odd and even positions. The function does not handle cases where the input characters are the same, which would be invalid based on the problem requirements.
