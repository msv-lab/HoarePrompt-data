The code assigns the value of `len(sequence)` to the variable `length`. The length of `sequence` is determined by the constraints provided (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Since `sequence` is a string consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', `length` will be an integer representing the number of characters in `sequence`. The states of the other variables (`oddchar` and `evenchar`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `length` is n**
