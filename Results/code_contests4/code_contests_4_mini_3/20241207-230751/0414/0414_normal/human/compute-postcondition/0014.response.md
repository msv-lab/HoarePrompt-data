Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`, `oddmisplaced` is 2 if `i` is an odd integer and `sequence[i]` is not equal to `oddchar`. If `i` is an even integer and `sequence[i]` is not equal to `evenchar`, then `evenmisplaced` is updated to 2. The condition for the loop to execute a second time is that `length` must be greater than `i`.***
