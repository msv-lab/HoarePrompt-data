Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`, if `i` is even and `sequence[i]` is not equal to `evenchar`, then `evenmisplaced` is increased by 1 and `i` will be incremented by 1. If `i` is not even or `sequence[i]` is equal to `evenchar`, the state remains unchanged with respect to `evenmisplaced` and `i` will still be incremented by 1.***
