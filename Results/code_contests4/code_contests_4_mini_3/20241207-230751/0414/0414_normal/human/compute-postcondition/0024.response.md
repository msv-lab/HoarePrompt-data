The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `sequence`, `oddchar`, and `evenchar`. The parameter `sequence` is a string of length n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) consisting of characters 'b' and 'r'. The parameters `oddchar` and `evenchar` are characters ('b' or 'r') representing the colors for the odd and even positions, respectively, and they must be different from each other. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of 'swaps' and the absolute difference between 'evenmisplaced' and 'oddmisplaced'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sequence string and two different characters representing colors, and it computes and returns a value based on the number of swaps and misplaced characters in the sequence. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `sequence` of 'b' and 'r', and two different characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`, returning the sum of 'swaps' and the absolute difference between 'evenmisplaced' and 'oddmisplaced'.**
