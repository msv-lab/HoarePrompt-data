Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`, if `i` is odd and `sequence[i]` is not equal to `oddchar`, `oddmisplaced` is increased by 1 and the states of `evenmisplaced` and `i` remain unchanged. If `i` is not odd or `sequence[i]` is equal to `oddchar`, the states of both `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced` remain unchanged, while `i` will still be incremented by 1.***
