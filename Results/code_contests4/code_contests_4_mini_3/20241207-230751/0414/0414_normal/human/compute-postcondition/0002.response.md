The variable `evenmisplaced` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `sequence` (a string of length n), `length` (which is n), and `oddmisplaced` (which is 0). The initialization of `evenmisplaced` does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `sequence` is a string of length n, `length` is n, `oddmisplaced` is 0, `evenmisplaced` is 0.

Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length n, `length` is n, `oddmisplaced` is 0, `evenmisplaced` is 0**
