Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `sequence` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', along with two different characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`. It counts the number of misplaced characters in odd and even positions of the string compared to the expected characters and calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to correct these misplacements. It then returns the total number of swaps plus the absolute difference between the counts of misplaced characters in odd and even positions. The function does not handle cases where the input characters are the same, which would be invalid based on the problem requirements. **
