The value of `oddmisplaced` is incremented by 1, which means its new value will be 1 (since it was initially 0). The values of the other variables (`sequence`, `length`, `evenmisplaced`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`, `oddmisplaced` is 1, `evenmisplaced` is 1, and `i` is an odd integer.

Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`, `oddmisplaced` is 1, `evenmisplaced` is 1, `i` is an odd integer**
