You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anatoly lives in the university dorm as many other students do. As you know, cockroaches are also living there together with students. Cockroaches might be of two colors: black and red. There are n cockroaches living in Anatoly's room.

Anatoly just made all his cockroaches to form a single line. As he is a perfectionist, he would like the colors of cockroaches in the line to alternate. He has a can of black paint and a can of red paint. In one turn he can either swap any two cockroaches, or take any single cockroach and change it's color.

Help Anatoly find out the minimum number of turns he needs to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of cockroaches.

The second line contains a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r' that denote black cockroach and red cockroach respectively.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of moves Anatoly has to perform in order to make the colors of cockroaches in the line to alternate.

Examples

Input

5
rbbrr


Output

1


Input

5
bbbbb


Output

2


Input

3
rbr


Output

0

Note

In the first sample, Anatoly has to swap third and fourth cockroaches. He needs 1 turn to do this.

In the second sample, the optimum answer is to paint the second and the fourth cockroaches red. This requires 2 turns.

In the third sample, the colors of cockroaches in the line are alternating already, thus the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func_1(sequence, oddchar, evenchar):
    length = len(sequence)
    oddmisplaced = 0
    evenmisplaced = 0
    for i in range(length):
        if i % 2 == 0 and sequence[i] != evenchar:
            evenmisplaced = evenmisplaced + 1
        if i % 2 == 1 and sequence[i] != oddchar:
            oddmisplaced = oddmisplaced + 1
    swaps = min(evenmisplaced, oddmisplaced)
    color = abs(evenmisplaced - oddmisplaced)
    return swaps + color
n = raw_input()
n = int(n)
sequence = raw_input()
result = min(func_1(sequence, 'r', 'b'), func_1(sequence, 'b', 'r'))
print(result)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
