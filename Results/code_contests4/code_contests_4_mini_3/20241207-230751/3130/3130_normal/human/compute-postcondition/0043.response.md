Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, which must include at least one zero. It calculates the minimum distance from each element in the array to the nearest zero and outputs these distances. If an index does not have a zero reachable, its distance remains -1. The function handles the edge case where all elements are negative or positive but ensures at least one zero is present in the input.**
