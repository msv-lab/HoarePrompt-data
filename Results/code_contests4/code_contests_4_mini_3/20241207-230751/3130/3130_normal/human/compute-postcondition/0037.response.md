The code appends a tuple to the list `que`. The tuple consists of `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`. Since `ix` is provided as part of the initial state, we can determine the values that will be used in the tuple. The value of `lev` is also known to be updated in the list `out`. Therefore, `lev + 1` will be one greater than the current value of `lev`.

Since thereâ€™s no specific value provided for `ix`, we can only express the output state in terms of `ix`, `lev`, and how they affect the variables. The output state will reflect the addition of the new tuple to the `que` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `out` is a list of `n` integers with one element updated to `lev` at index `ix`; `que` now includes the tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`**.
