According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on whether the list `que` contains any elements. If `que` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `que` has elements in it, but we do not know the exact contents of `que`. 

Since `que` is not explicitly mentioned in the provided state, we must ensure that `que` has at least one element for the loop to execute one more time. If `que` is empty at this point, the loop cannot execute again.

However, based on the given state, we know that if `out[ix]` is not -1 and if `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`, a tuple is appended to `que`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we would need at least one valid index `ix` such that `out[ix]` is not -1. 

Since we don't have information about the current content of `que`, we cannot make specific adjustments to the state. We can only state that `que` must contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `out` is a list of `n` integers initialized to -1; for the loop to execute again, `que` must contain at least one element.**
