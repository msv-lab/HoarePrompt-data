The code provided prints the values contained in the list `out`, joining them into a single string separated by spaces. The `map(str, out)` converts each element of `out` into a string format, and `print` outputs this formatted string.

Since `out` contains the levels assigned based on proximity to indices where `a[i]` was 0, we assume `out` has been populated accordingly prior to this line of code. The state of the other variables, `n` and `que`, is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `que` is empty; `out` contains the levels assigned to each index based on the proximity to the indices where `a[i]` was 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `que` is empty; `out` contains the levels assigned to each index based on the proximity to the indices where `a[i]` was 0.**
