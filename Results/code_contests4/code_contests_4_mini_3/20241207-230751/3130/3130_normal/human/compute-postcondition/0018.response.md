The code appends a new tuple to the `que` list. The new tuple consists of two values: `ix + 1` and `lev + 1`. Since `ix + 1` is between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, it is a valid index for appending. The values of `n`, `que`, `out`, and other variables remain unchanged aside from the modification to `que`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `que` now contains an additional tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1); `out` is a list of n integers all initialized to -1; `ix` and `lev` remain unchanged.**
