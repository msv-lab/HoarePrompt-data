The code assigns the value of `lev` to the index `ix` of the list `out`. The variable `ix` is an index into the list `out`, and `lev` is a value that will be placed at that index. Given that `out` is initialized to a list of `n` integers all set to -1, the specific value of `lev` will replace the -1 at index `ix` in `out`. The other variables (`n`, `que`, etc.) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `out` is a list of `n` integers with one element updated to `lev` at index `ix`; `ix` and `lev` are assigned values from `que`.**
