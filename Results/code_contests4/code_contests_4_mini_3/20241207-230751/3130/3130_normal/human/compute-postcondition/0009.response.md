According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` will be 2. The loop will execute again as long as `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
