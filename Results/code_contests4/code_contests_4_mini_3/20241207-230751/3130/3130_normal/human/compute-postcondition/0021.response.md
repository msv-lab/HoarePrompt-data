The code `que.append((ix - 1, lev + 1))` appends a tuple to the list `que`. The first element of the tuple is `ix - 1`, and the second element is `lev + 1`. 

1. The value of `ix` is such that `ix - 1` must be between `0` and `n - 1`, meaning it is a valid index. 
2. The value of `lev` is incremented by 1, so `lev + 1` becomes the new level to be appended. 
3. The list `out` remains unchanged and still contains `n` integers initialized to -1. 

Since there are no changes to `ix` or `lev` themselves, only the list `que` is affected by the addition of a new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `que` contains an additional tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`; `out` remains a list of n integers initialized to -1; `ix` and `lev` unchanged.**
