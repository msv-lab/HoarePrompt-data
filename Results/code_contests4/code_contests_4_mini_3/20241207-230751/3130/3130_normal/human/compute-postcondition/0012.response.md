To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes the elements of the list `a`.

The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. For each index, it checks if the value at `a[i]` is `0` (i.e., `not a[i]` is true). If the value is `0`, it appends the tuple `(i, 0)` to the deque `que`. If the value is not `0`, `que` remains unchanged.

Since `a` is guaranteed to contain at least one `0` (as per the initial state), the loop will append at least one tuple to `que`. 

After the loop executes:
- `que` will contain tuples for every index `i` where the value at `a[i]` is `0`. For each of those indices, the tuple format will be `(i, 0)`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `out` remains unchanged and will still be initialized to all `-1`s.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `que` contains tuples of the form (i, 0) for each index i where `a[i]` is 0, `out` is a list of n integers all initialized to -1.**
