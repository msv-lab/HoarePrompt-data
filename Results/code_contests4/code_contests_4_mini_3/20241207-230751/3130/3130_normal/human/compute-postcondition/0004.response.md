The code appends a tuple `(i, 0)` to the list `que`. The current value of `i` is 0. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `que` with the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 0, the value at `a[i]` is false (not true), and `que` now includes the tuple (0, 0).**
