The code appends a tuple `(i, 0)` to the list `que`. The variable `i` has a value of 2, and the second element of the tuple is 0. The previous state of `que` is not provided, so we assume it exists but do not know its current contents. The output state does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 2, and `que` now includes the tuple `(2, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 2, `que` now includes the tuple (2, 0)**
