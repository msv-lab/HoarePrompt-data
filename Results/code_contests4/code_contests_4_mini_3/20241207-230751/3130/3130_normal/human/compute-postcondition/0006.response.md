According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 0. 

If the loop executes a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `a[i]` will determine if any changes occur in `que`. If `a[1]` is false, then `que` will include the tuple (1, 1). If `a[1]` is true, there will be no changes in `que`.

State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 1, if the value at `a[i]` is false then `que` includes the tuple (1, 1)**
