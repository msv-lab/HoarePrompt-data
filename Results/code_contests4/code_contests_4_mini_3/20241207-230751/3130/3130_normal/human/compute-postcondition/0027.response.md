The `que` list is modified by appending a new tuple consisting of `ix + 1` and `lev + 1`. The previous values of `ix` and `lev` are used to calculate the new values. Since `ix` and `lev` are extracted from the first tuple of `que`, they are integers. The values of `out` and other variables remain unchanged. 

After execution, `que` will contain an additional tuple with the values calculated as `(ix + 1, lev + 1)`. The specific values of `ix` and `lev` are not given, so we can only denote the changes in terms of their variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `out` is a list of `n` integers initialized to -1; `que` now has an additional tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` appended.**
