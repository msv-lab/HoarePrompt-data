The code `que.append((i, 0))` adds a tuple consisting of the current value of `i` and `0` to the list `que`. The value of `i` is 1, so the tuple (1, 0) is appended to `que`. The other variables like `n` and `a[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 1, `que` includes the tuple (1, 1), and now `que` includes the tuple (1, 0).

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 1, `que` includes the tuple (1, 1), and now `que` includes the tuple (1, 0)**
