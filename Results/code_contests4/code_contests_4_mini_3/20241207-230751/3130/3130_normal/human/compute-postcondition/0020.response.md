Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; if `0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1`, then `que` contains an additional tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` and `out` remains a list of n integers initialized to -1, with `ix` and `lev` unchanged. Additionally, `ix` is an integer such that `ix - 1` is between 0 and `n - 1`.***
