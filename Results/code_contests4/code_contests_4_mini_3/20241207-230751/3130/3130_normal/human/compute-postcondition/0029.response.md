The code appends a tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` to the list `que`. The values of `ix` and `lev` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, but we can say that `ix` is an index and `lev` is a level that will be incremented by 1. The list `que` is affected by this operation, and no other variables are impacted directly from this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `que`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `out` is a list of `n` integers initialized to -1; `que` now includes the tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` appended to it.**
