Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `out` is a list of `n` integers initialized to -1; if `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`, the tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que`. If `ix - 1` is within the bounds, `que` will include the tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`. Otherwise, `que` remains unchanged.***
