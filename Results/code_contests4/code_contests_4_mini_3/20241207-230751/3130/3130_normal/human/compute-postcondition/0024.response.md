According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `que`. The loop will continue executing as long as `que` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, if `que` is empty, then for the loop to execute one more time, `que` must contain at least one element.

From the provided state information, there is no indication that `que` has been modified to contain any elements that would allow the loop to execute again. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `que` has at least one tuple.

State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `out` remains a list of `n` integers initialized to -1, and for the loop to execute again, `que` must contain at least one tuple.**
