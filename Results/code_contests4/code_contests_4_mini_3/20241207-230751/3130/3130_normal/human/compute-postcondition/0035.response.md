The code appends a tuple containing `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` to the list `que`. The previous values of `ix` and `lev` are derived from the current state of the program. The increment operations lead to the new values being `ix + 1` and `lev + 1`. The list `que` is updated with this new tuple, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `out` is a list of `n` integers with one element updated to `lev` at index `ix`; `que` now includes an additional tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `out` is a list of `n` integers with one element updated to `lev` at index `ix`; `que` now includes an additional tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)`**.
