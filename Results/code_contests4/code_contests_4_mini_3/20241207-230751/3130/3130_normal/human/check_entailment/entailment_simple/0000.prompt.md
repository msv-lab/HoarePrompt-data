You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given the array of integer numbers a0, a1, ..., an - 1. For each element find the distance to the nearest zero (to the element which equals to zero). There is at least one zero element in the given array.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — length of the array a. The second line contains integer elements of the array separated by single spaces ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output

Print the sequence d0, d1, ..., dn - 1, where di is the difference of indices between i and nearest j such that aj = 0. It is possible that i = j.

Examples

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) followed by n integers that can range from -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000, and there is at least one zero in the array.
def func():
    n, a = int(input()), [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    out, que = [-1] * n, deque()
    for i in range(n):
        if not a[i]:
            que.append((i, 0))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000, `que` contains tuples of the form (i, 0) for each index i where `a[i]` is 0, `out` is a list of n integers all initialized to -1.
    while que:
        ix, lev = que.popleft()
        
        if out[ix] != -1:
            out[ix] = lev
            if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1:
                que.append((ix + 1, lev + 1))
            if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1:
                que.append((ix - 1, lev + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer input between 1 and 200,000; `que` is empty; `out` contains the levels assigned to each index based on the proximity to the indices where `a[i]` was 0, with indices that were not reached remaining as -1.
    print(' '.join(map(str, out)))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
