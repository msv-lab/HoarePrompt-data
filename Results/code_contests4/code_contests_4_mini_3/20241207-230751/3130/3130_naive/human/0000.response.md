To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and check if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the distance of each element in an array to the nearest zero. The output should be a sequence of integers where each integer represents the distance to the nearest zero.

### Provided Program Review:
```python
(n, a) = (int(input()), [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()])
(out, que) = ([-1] * n, deque())
for i in range(n):
    if not a[i]:
        que.append((i, 0))
while que:
    (ix, lev) = que.popleft()
    if out[ix] != -1:
        out[ix] = lev
        if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1:
            que.append((ix + 1, lev + 1))
        if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1:
            que.append((ix - 1, lev + 1))
print(' '.join(map(str, out)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an output list `out` with `-1` for all indices, which is appropriate since the distances will be calculated and filled later.
2. **Queue for BFS**: It uses a `deque` to perform a breadth-first search (BFS), which is a good approach to find the minimum distance to zero.
3. **Finding Zeros**: It correctly identifies all indices where `a[i]` is zero and initializes the queue with these indices.
4. **Distance Calculation**: The program processes each index in the queue, checking its neighbors (left and right). It updates the distance if the current index has not been set, which is correct in the context of BFS.
5. **Boundary Conditions**: The checks for boundaries (`0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1` and `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`) are appropriate to avoid index errors.

### Potential Issue:
However, there is a logical flaw in how the program handles the distances. Specifically, the line:
```python
if out[ix] != -1:
```
should be:
```python
if out[ix] == -1:
```
This is because we want to set the distance only if it hasn't been set yet. The current logic will skip updating distances for the indices, which leads to incorrect results.

### Example Case of Failure:
For an input:
```
5
0 0 0 1 2
```
The expected output should be:
```
0 0 0 1 2
```
However, due to the logical error in the condition, the program may not update the non-zero elements correctly, leading to simply returning the initial `-1` or not calculating the correct distances.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the identified issue, the program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
