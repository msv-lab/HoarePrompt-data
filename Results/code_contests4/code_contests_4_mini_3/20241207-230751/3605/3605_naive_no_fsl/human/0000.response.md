The provided program is:

```python
print(input() + 4) / 5
```

Let's analyze the program based on the problem description:

1. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum number of steps an elephant needs to take to reach his friend's house located `x` units away from position 0, where he can take steps of lengths 1 to 5.

2. The logic for determining the number of steps is not correctly implemented. The expression `input() + 4` attempts to add 4 to the user input, but since `input()` returns a string, this will result in a TypeError when trying to perform arithmetic directly without converting the input to an integer.

3. Even if the input was converted to an integer, the formula `(input() + 4) / 5` does not correctly calculate the minimum steps. The correct approach is to divide the distance `x` by 5 and round up, since the elephant can take steps of up to 5 units.

For example, if `x = 12`, the expected output should be `3` because the elephant can take steps of 5, 5, and 2, which totals 12 units. However, the program will not produce this result.

To demonstrate a specific case where the program fails:
- For input `12`, the program will raise an error due to improper string addition, and thus it won't produce any output, confirming that it does not meet the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
