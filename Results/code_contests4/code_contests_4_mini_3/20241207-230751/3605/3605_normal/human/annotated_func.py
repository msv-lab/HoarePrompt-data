#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1,000,000.
def func():
    print(input() + 4) / 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for input, adds 4 to that input, and attempts to divide the result by 5. However, it does not return any value, as the result of the division is neither stored nor returned. Additionally, if the input is not a number or is outside the expected range, it could lead to a runtime error.
