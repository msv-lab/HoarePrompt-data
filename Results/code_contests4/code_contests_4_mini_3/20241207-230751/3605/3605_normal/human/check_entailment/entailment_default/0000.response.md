The provided program attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of steps an elephant needs to take to reach a friend's house located at point x, where the elephant can move between 1 to 5 positions in one step. 

The program is as follows:
```python
print(input() + 4) / 5
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program reads an integer input which represents the coordinate of the friend's house.
2. It adds 4 to this input and then divides the result by 5.
3. However, the output is not printed correctly as it doesn't return or print the number of steps. The expression doesn't account for integer division or rounding down, which is essential to determine the minimum number of steps.

### Edge Cases:
Considering the problem's requirements:
- If `x` is 1, the expected output should be 1 (one step of 1).
- If `x` is 5, the expected output should be 1 (one step of 5).
- If `x` is 6, the expected output should be 2 (one step of 5 and one step of 1).
- If `x` is 7, the expected output should be 2 (one step of 5 and one step of 2).
- If `x` is 12, the expected output should be 3 (for example, steps of 5, 5, and 2).

The current implementation does not correctly handle these calculations, as it doesn't properly compute the minimum steps needed.

### Output Hints:
The output hints suggest that the function does not return any value, which aligns with the observation that the code merely performs a calculation without appropriate output. The hints also note that the input must be a number and that the behavior of the code could lead to issues if invalid input is provided.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases. It does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps needed to reach the friend's house and fails to return any meaningful output.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to compute the correct number of steps needed for various values of `x`, for instance, it would incorrectly handle cases like `x = 6` or `x = 12`, and it does not provide the required output format.
