Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` directly without converting it to an integer. This could lead to incorrect behavior since `input()` returns a string, and the addition operation performed (`input() + 4`) would result in a TypeError if `input()` returns a non-numeric string.

2. **Logic for Minimum Steps**: The logic in the function attempts to add 4 to the input and then divides by 5. This does not compute the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach his friend's house at coordinate `x`. The formula logic is incorrect for determining the number of steps needed.

3. **Output**: The program does not return any value or print the correct number of steps. It only prints the result of the division operation, which is not relevant to the problem description.

4. **Correct Calculation**: The minimum number of steps can be calculated by dividing `x` by 5 and rounding up if there is a remainder. This is not represented in the provided code.

Due to these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements laid out in the problem description.
