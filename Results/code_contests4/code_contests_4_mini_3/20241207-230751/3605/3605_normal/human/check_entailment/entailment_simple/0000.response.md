Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` to read the input but does not convert it to an integer. This will lead to a TypeError when performing arithmetic operations, as `input()` returns a string.

2. **Calculation Logic**: The formula used in the program (`(input() + 4) / 5`) does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach his friend's house. According to the problem, the elephant can move 1 to 5 positions in each step. The correct approach to determine the number of steps is to divide the distance `x` by 5 (the maximum step size) and round up to account for any remaining distance.

3. **Output**: The program attempts to print the result of the calculation directly, but it does not correctly compute the number of steps. Additionally, it includes `+ 4` in its calculation, which is not part of the problem description and does not logically relate to the solution.

A correct implementation would involve reading the integer input, calculating the number of steps needed to cover the distance `x` using the formula `steps = (x + 4) // 5`, and then printing the result. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
