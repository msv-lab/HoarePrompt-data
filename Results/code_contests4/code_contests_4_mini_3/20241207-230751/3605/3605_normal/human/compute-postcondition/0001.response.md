The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the constraints, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1,000,000, but since there are no parameters for the function to accept, this constraint does not apply directly. The details of the output are not provided, so we cannot determine the return value of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be explicitly described without further information about its behavior or output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and has an unspecified return value.**
