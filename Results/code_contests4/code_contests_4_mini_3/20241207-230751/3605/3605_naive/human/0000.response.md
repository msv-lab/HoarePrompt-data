Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to reach his friend's house. 

For example, if the input is `5`, the expected output is `1` since the elephant can reach point `5` in one step of length `5`. However, the program will output `0.8` instead, because it adds `4` to the input and then divides by `5`, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. 

Thus, the program fails to follow the problem description for at least one input case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
