Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has several issues that cause it to behave incorrectly for certain cases. For example:

1. The program uses `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which assumes that the input values are integers. However, the problem description specifies that the input consists of real numbers. This discrepancy means that inputs such as `0.5`, `3.14`, or `2.718` would cause a `ValueError` as they cannot be converted to integers.

2. The logic used to determine the relationships between the circles appears to be flawed. Specifically:
   - The condition `if d > (ra + rb) ** 2:` checks if the circles do not overlap, which is correct.
   - The check `elif ra > rb:` does not account for the case when `ra` and `rb` are equal. If `ra` is equal to `rb` and the circles are separate, it would not be handled correctly.
   - The checks for whether one circle is inside the other (`2` for `B` inside `A` and `-2` for `A` inside `B`) are not comprehensive. The conditions must also ensure that the distance `d` is compared correctly against the radii, and the logic may fail for edge cases where the circles touch at exactly one point.

For example, consider two circles with coordinates and radii as follows:
- Circle A: center (0, 0), radius 5
- Circle B: center (5, 0), radius 5

In this case, the circles are touching at one point, which should result in an output of `1`. However, due to the flawed logic and the integer assumption, the program may not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, due to these issues, the program is deemed incorrect.
