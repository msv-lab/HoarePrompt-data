You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given circle $A$ with radius $r_a$ and with central coordinate $(x_a, y_a)$ and circle $B$ with radius $r_b$ and with central coordinate $(x_b, y_b)$.

Write a program which prints:

* "2" if $B$ is in $A$,
* "-2" if $A$ is in $B$,
* "1" if circumference of $A$ and $B$ intersect, and
* "0" if $A$ and $B$ do not overlap.



You may assume that $A$ and $B$ are not identical.



Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. The first line consists of an integer $N$ ($N \leq 50$), the number of datasets. There will be $N$ lines where each line represents each dataset. Each data set consists of real numbers:

$x_a$ $y_a$ $r_a$ $x_b$ $y_b$ $r_b$

Output

For each dataset, print 2, -2, 1, or 0 in a line.

Example

Input

2
0.0 0.0 5.0 0.0 0.0 4.0
0.0 0.0 2.0 4.1 0.0 2.0


Output

2
0
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, and each dataset consists of six real numbers (x_a, y_a, r_a, x_b, y_b, r_b) representing the coordinates and radii of circles A and B.
def func():
    n = input()
    for i in xrange(n):
        xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        d = (xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2
        
        if d > (ra + rb) ** 2:
            print(0)
        elif ra > rb:
            if (ra - rb) ** 2 > d:
                print(2)
            else:
                print(1)
        elif (rb - ra) ** 2 > d:
            print(-2)
        else:
            print(1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is equal to `N`; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from input corresponding to each iteration; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb)² + (ya - yb)² for each iteration. The output printed during the loop will be based on the comparisons of `d`, `ra`, and `rb` for each pair of inputs.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
