Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for multiple reasons:

1. **Data Type Handling**: The program uses `map(int, raw_input().split())` to read the input values. This forces all six input values (coordinates and radii) to be integers, while the problem description states that these values are real numbers. This will lead to incorrect behavior when the input includes decimal values, as it will truncate them to integers.

2. **Input Handling**: The program uses `xrange(n)` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, this should be `range(n)`. The use of `xrange` indicates that the program is not compatible with Python 3, which is more current and widely used.

3. **Logic for Circle Relationship**: The logic implemented for determining the relationship between the circles is flawed:
   - When checking if circle A contains circle B, the condition should correctly ensure that the distance `d` between the centers plus the radius of circle B is less than or equal to the radius of circle A. The current check `(ra - rb) ** 2 > d` is not sufficient because it only checks if the distance is less than the difference of radii squared. It should also check if the distance is less than or equal to the square of the radius of circle A.
   - Similarly, for checking if circle B contains circle A, the logic must ensure that the distance `d` is within the bounds defined by the radius of circle B.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the circles just touch (tangential contact) properly as it only checks for strict inequalities.

5. **Output Handling**: The program does not clearly define what to output for cases where the circles intersect tangentially or do not touch at all.

These issues mean that the program does not consistently meet the requirements laid out in the problem description for all potential inputs.
