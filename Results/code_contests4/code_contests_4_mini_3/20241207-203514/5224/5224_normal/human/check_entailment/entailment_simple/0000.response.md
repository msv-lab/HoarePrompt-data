Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which converts the inputs into integers. However, the problem description states that the inputs are real numbers (floats), so the program should use `map(float, raw_input().split())` instead.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance `d` is calculated correctly as the squared distance between the centers of the circles. However, the comparisons made afterward to determine the relationship between the circles do not correctly reflect the requirements laid out in the problem description.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program checks if the circles do not overlap (`d > (ra + rb) ** 2`), which is correct for outputting "0".
   - It checks if circle A is contained within circle B using `if (ra - rb) ** 2 > d`. However, this does not account for the case where both circles are of the same radius but centered at different points.
   - The logic to determine if circle B is contained within circle A is flawed and may not always lead to the correct output. It should also consider the case when the circles touch at a single point, which is not explicitly handled in the current implementation.

4. **Output**: The conditions for printing "1" when the circumferences intersect do not take into account all edge cases accurately, such as when the circles are tangent to each other.

For these reasons, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
