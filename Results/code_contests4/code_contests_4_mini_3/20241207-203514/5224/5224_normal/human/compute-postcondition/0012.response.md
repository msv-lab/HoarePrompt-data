Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 0; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from input; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); `d` is less than or equal to (ra + rb) squared; `ra` is greater than `rb`. If the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`, the value 2 is printed. Otherwise, if the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is less than or equal to `d`, the output is 1.***
