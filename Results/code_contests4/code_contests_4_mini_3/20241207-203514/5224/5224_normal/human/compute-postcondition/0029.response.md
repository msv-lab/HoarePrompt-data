The code snippet `print(1)` executes a print operation and outputs the integer `1`. The values of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb`, and `d`) remain unchanged as this operation does not affect them. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from the input; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); printed value is 1.**
