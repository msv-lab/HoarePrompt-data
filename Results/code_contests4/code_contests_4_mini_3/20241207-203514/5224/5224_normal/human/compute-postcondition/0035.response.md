The variable `d` is assigned the value of the expression `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned from `raw_input` and split into integers, but their exact values are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the impact of this calculation without specifying particular values.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2**
