Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is equal to `N`; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from input corresponding to each iteration; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb)² + (ya - yb)² for each iteration. The output printed during the loop will be based on the comparisons of `d`, `ra`, and `rb` for each pair of inputs.**
