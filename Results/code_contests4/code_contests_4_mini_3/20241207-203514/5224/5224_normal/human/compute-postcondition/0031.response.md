Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from the input; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If (ra - rb)Â² > d, the value 2 is printed; otherwise, the value 1 is printed. If `ra` is not greater than `rb`, the value printed will depend on the comparison of the squares of the differences, though the specific actions are not provided in the else part.***
