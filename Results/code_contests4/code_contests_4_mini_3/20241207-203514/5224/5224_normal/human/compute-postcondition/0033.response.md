According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the non-negative integer `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. After the last iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
