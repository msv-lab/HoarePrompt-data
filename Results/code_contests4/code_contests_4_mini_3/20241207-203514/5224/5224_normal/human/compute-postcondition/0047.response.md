Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (less than or equal to 50), which represents the number of datasets. For each dataset, it reads six integers representing the coordinates and radii of two circles (A and B). It calculates the squared distance `d` between the centers of the circles and compares this distance with the sum and difference of their radii to determine their relationship. The output for each dataset is as follows: if the circles are separate, it prints 0; if circle A contains circle B, it prints 2; if circle B contains circle A, it prints -2; if the circles intersect, it prints 1. The function does not return any values but prints results directly to the console for each dataset processed. **
