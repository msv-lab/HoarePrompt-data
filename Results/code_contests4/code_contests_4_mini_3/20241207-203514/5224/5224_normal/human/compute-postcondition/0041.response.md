The code executes a print statement that outputs the value `1`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) and we print `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb), and we print `1`**.
