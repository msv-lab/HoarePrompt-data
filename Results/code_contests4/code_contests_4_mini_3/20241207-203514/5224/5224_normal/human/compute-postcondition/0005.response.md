The code snippet simply prints the integer `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 0; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from input; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared; and the output printed is 0.**
