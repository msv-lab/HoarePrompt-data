According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
