Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2, and `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `ra` is greater than `rb`, then the function operates with the condition where `ra - rb` holds. Otherwise, the function operates with the condition where `rb - ra` holds, maintaining the values of `N`, `i`, and `d` as initially stated.***
