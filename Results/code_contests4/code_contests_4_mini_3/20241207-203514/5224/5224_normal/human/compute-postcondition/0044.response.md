Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2. If `d` (calculated as `xa - xb`) is greater than `(ra + rb) ** 2`, the output is 0. Otherwise, if `ra` is greater than `rb`, the function operates under the condition where `ra - rb` holds; if not, it operates under the condition where `rb - ra` holds, while maintaining the values of `N`, `i`, and `d` as initially stated.***
