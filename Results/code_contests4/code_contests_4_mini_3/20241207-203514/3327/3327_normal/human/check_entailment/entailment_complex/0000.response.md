Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement any logic to determine the minimum number of edges needed to make the graph harmonious. The functions primarily focus on input handling and output formatting, without any processing of the graph structure or validation of the harmonious property as described in the problem statement.

For example, the problem requires checking for every triple (l, m, r) such that if there's a path from l to r, there should also be paths from l to m for all m in between. The code does not have any functionality to build or analyze the graph based on the edges provided. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Additionally, the annotations mention input handling without any logic to check the graph's harmony, which is essential to solve the problem. The lack of any graph processing or edge addition logic directly contradicts the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect.
