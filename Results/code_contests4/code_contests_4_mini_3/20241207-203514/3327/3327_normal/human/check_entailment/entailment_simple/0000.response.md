Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description regarding determining the minimum number of edges needed to make a graph harmonious. 

Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Lack of Graph Processing**: The functions defined in the program (func_1 through func_5) primarily focus on input handling and do not include any logic to analyze the graph structure or determine the paths between nodes as required by the problem description. 

2. **Missing Functionality for Harmony Check**: The problem requires checking the harmony condition for triples of nodes in the graph. The provided program does not contain any implementation that checks whether for every triple (l, m, r), if there is a path from l to r, there must also be a path from l to m. 

3. **No Edge Addition Logic**: The problem explicitly asks for the minimum number of edges to be added to achieve harmony. The program lacks any mechanism to compute or suggest these edges based on the state of the graph after evaluating its connectivity.

4. **Input/Output Functions Only**: All functions in the program are concerned with input and output operations (reading input, returning lists, and printing values) without any processing of the graph's properties or the actual logic needed to solve the problem.

In summary, the functions present in the program do not implement the necessary logic to check for harmony in the graph or to find the minimum number of edges to add, leading to the conclusion that the program is not correct according to the specified problem description.
