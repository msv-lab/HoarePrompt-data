The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers that are inputted by the user. These integers are expected to represent edges in pairs, but the function does not validate the input to ensure that it meets the constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and u_i ≠ v_i). Therefore, it simply returns whatever integers are provided by the user without checking for these conditions.
