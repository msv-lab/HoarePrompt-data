The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes standard input to read a mapped list of integers that represent pairs of edges defined by integers (u_i, v_i) for a simple graph with `n` nodes. This graph is defined by the constraints where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, ensuring that the edges are valid with no self-loops and at most one edge between any pair of nodes. The output of the function is this mapped list of integers that represents the edges of the graph.

Functionality: **The function processes standard input to return a mapped list of integers representing the pairs of edges (u_i, v_i) for a simple graph with n nodes.**
