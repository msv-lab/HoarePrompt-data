Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes standard input to return a mapped list of integers. These integers represent the pairs of edges defined by pairs of integers (u_i, v_i) for a simple graph with n nodes. However, since the function does not have any error handling or checks for invalid input, it assumes that the input adheres to the constraints specified in the comments. If the input does not meet these constraints, the function may not behave as expected.**
