#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and each of the m edges is defined by two distinct integers u_i and v_i where 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user through raw_input()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user through `raw_input()`, assuming valid input is given. If the user provides invalid input (non-integer), it will raise an error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and each of the m edges is represented by a pair of integers (u_i, v_i) where 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are inputted by the user, representing the edges in pairs from the prompt.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers that are inputted by the user. These integers are expected to represent edges in pairs, but the function does not validate the input to ensure that it meets the constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and u_i ≠ v_i). Therefore, it simply returns whatever integers are provided by the user without checking for these conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000). The subsequent m lines contain pairs of integers (u_i, v_i) representing edges, where 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph and outputs the value of `n` as a string followed by a newline. However, it does not process any edges or perform any operations related to the edges as suggested by the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n is the number of nodes (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and m is the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000). Following this, there are m pairs of integers (u_i, v_i) representing the edges, where 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `arr` containing two integers `n` (the number of nodes) and `m` (the number of edges), and it prints the elements of the tuple as a space-separated string followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and the edges are defined by pairs of integers (u_i, v_i) where 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i, ensuring that the graph is simple with no self-loops and at most one edge between any pair of nodes.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a mapped list of integers from the standard input, which represents the pairs of edges defined by integers (u_i, v_i) for the simple graph with n nodes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes standard input to return a mapped list of integers. These integers represent the pairs of edges defined by pairs of integers (u_i, v_i) for a simple graph with n nodes. However, since the function does not have any error handling or checks for invalid input, it assumes that the input adheres to the constraints specified in the comments. If the input does not meet these constraints, the function may not behave as expected.
