Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the required number of participants exceeds the total population of the city. For example, consider the input:

```
n = 10, x = 5, y = 200
```

According to the problem description, 200% of 10 people means that 20 people are required to attend the demonstration. The program calculates:

```
y = (10 * 200) / 100 - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15
```

It then checks if `y % 1 == 0` (which is true), and outputs `15` (indicating that 15 clones are needed). However, this scenario is incorrect because it is impossible to create enough clones to meet the required attendance since the total population is only 10.

The program fails to account for situations where the required percentage exceeds 100%, leading to a needed participant count greater than `n`. Therefore, the logic should also handle cases where this situation arises, and indicate that the number of clones needed is equal to `required - x` when `required > x`, or `0` when `required <= x`.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
