To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and identify any potential issues.

### Problem Description Overview:
- There are `n` people in total, with `x` wizards who will attend the demonstration.
- The city administration requires at least `y` percent of `n` to be present for the demonstration to be considered valid.
- The task is to compute the minimum number of clones needed to ensure the wizards and their clones reach or exceed the required percentage.

### Code Analysis:
```python
c = raw_input()
p = c.split()
num = []
for i in p:
    num.append(int(i))
y = float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100) - num[1]
if y % 1 == 0:
    print(int(y))
else:
    print(int(y) + 1)
```

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads a single line of input, splits it into parts, and converts them to integers. This part is correct.

2. **Calculation of Required Attendance**:
   - The line `y = float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100) - num[1]` computes the required number of people based on the formula:
     \[
     \text{required\_people} = \left(\frac{n \times y}{100}\right) - x
     \]
   - This calculates how many more people (including clones) are needed beyond the current wizards.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program checks if the result `y` is an integer. If it is an integer, it prints it directly; if not, it rounds up by adding 1 before printing.
   - However, there are potential issues:
     - If `x` (the number of wizards) is already greater than or equal to the required number of people, the output should be `0` (no clones needed).
     - If `y` is greater than `100`, the requirement can result in a negative value for `y`, which is not properly handled.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
10 5 120
```
- Here, we have `n = 10`, `x = 5`, and `y = 120`.
- The required number of people is:
  \[
  \text{required\_people} = \left(\frac{10 \times 120}{100}\right) = 12
  \]
- Thus, the calculation in the program would yield:
  \[
  y = 12 - 5 = 7
  \]
- The program would print `7`, but since `12` is greater than `10`, this indicates that the program does not handle cases where `y` exceeds the total population correctly. It should instead indicate that an impossible scenario has arisen.

### Conclusion:
Due to the aforementioned issues, particularly the program's inability to handle the case when `y` exceeds `100` and other edge cases where `x` might already satisfy the condition, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**.
