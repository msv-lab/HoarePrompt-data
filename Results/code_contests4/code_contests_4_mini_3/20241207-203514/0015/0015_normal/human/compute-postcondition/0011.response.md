Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is updated to (float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100)) - num[1]; `c` is a non-empty string; `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `c`; `num` contains integer values of all elements in `p`; `y` is an integer (i.e., `y % 1 == 0`).***
