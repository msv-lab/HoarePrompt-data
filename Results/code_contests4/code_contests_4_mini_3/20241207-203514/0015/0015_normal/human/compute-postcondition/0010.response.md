To analyze the given code snippet, we will consider how the assignment affects the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `num` contains integer values obtained from splitting the string `c`. The code snippet accesses the first, third, and second elements of the list `num` (i.e., `num[0]`, `num[2]`, and `num[1]`).
2. The value of `y` is calculated as follows:
   - First, `num[0] * num[2]` is computed, which gives an integer product.
   - This product is then converted to a float.
   - The result is divided by `float(100)`, which converts `100` to a float.
   - Finally, `num[1]` is subtracted from this float result.

Since the initial state indicates that `n`, `x`, `y`, `c`, `p`, and `num` have defined constraints without specific values, we can only describe the relationship and express the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is updated to (float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100)) - num[1]; `c` is a non-empty string; `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `c`; `num` contains integer values of all elements in `p`.**
