The value of `i` is the first substring in `p`, and `num` is initially an empty list. The code appends the integer conversion of `i` to the list `num`. Therefore, after execution, `num` will contain one element, which is the integer value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4, `c` is a non-empty string, `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `c`, `num` contains the integer value of `i` as its first element.**
