According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. The loop will iterate over the substrings in `p`, and for the loop to execute at least once, `p` must contain at least one substring. Given that `p` is obtained by splitting the input string `c`, `c` must not be an empty string. 

The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they are constrained to be within the specified range. The variable `i` represents each substring in `p` during the loop iterations.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure:
1. `c` is a non-empty string (so that `p` contains at least one substring).
2. `i` will be the first substring in `p` on the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4, `c` is a non-empty string, `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `c`, `num` is an empty list; on the first iteration, `i` is the first substring in `p`.**
