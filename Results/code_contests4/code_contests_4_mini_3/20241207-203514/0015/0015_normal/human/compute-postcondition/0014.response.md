The value of `y` is already defined as a non-integer, and the expression `int(y)` effectively truncates the decimal part of `y`, leading to an integer value. After that, the code adds 1 to this truncated value. Therefore, the output state reflects that `y` has been processed to yield a specific integer output. The exact result of `int(y) + 1` depends on the specific value of `y`, but it is guaranteed to be one more than the integer part of `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is updated to (float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100)) - num[1]; `c` is a non-empty string; `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `c`; `num` contains integer values of all elements in `p`; and the output is `int(y) + 1`, which is a specific integer value greater than `int(y)`.**
