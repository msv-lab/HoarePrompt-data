Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, and `y` is updated to (float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100)) - num[1]. If `y` is an integer, the value of `y` is printed as an integer. Otherwise, the output is `int(y) + 1`, which is a specific integer value greater than `int(y)`.***
