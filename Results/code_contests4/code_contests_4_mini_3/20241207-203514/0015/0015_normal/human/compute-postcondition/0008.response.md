The code appends the integer value of `i`, which is the next substring in `p`, to the list `num`. The previous state of `num` is not specified, but it is being updated to include the new integer derived from `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4, `c` is a non-empty string, `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `c`, `num` is updated with an additional element which is `int(i)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4, `c` is a non-empty string, `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `c`, `num` is updated to contain an additional element which is `int(i)`**.
