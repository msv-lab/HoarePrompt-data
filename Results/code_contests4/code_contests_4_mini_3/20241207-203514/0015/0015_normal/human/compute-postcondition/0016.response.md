The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. All three parameters are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 10^4 and x ≤ n. The function does not return any specific output described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integer parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, adhering to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, x, and y, which are integers constrained by 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 10^4 and x ≤ n.**
