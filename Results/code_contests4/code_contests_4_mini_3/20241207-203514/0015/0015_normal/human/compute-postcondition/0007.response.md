According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `p`, which is obtained by splitting the non-empty string `c`. The variable `i` takes each value from the list `p` during each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `p` must contain at least one more element than it currently does.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `p` contains some substrings derived from `c`. The variable `i` would have taken the value of the last element in `p` during the last iteration, which means that the loop has iterated over all elements of `p` so far. 

For the loop to execute again, `p` must have at least one more element, and `i` should represent the next element in `p`. Assuming the next element corresponds to an index of the list that is one greater than what was used in the last iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4, `c` is a non-empty string, `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `c`, `num` is updated to contain an additional element which is `int(i)`, for the loop to execute one more time `p` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next substring in `p`.**
