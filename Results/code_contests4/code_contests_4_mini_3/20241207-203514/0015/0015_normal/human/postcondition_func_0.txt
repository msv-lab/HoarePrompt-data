The function reads a line of input containing three integers, where the first integer (num[0]) corresponds to `n`, the second (num[1]) corresponds to `x`, and the third (num[2]) corresponds to `y`. It calculates the value of `y` as `(num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]`. If the calculated `y` is an integer, it prints that integer; if not, it prints the next higher integer. The function does not accept parameters directly and relies on user input. It does not handle cases where the input does not contain exactly three integers or where the integers are out of the specified bounds.
