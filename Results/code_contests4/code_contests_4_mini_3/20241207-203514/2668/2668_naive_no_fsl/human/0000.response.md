To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The scientists want to choose a movie such that:
1. The number of scientists who know the audio language (very pleased) is maximized.
2. If there are ties in the number of very pleased scientists, the movie that maximizes the number of scientists who know the subtitle language (almost satisfied) should be chosen.

### Program Logic
1. The program reads the number of scientists and their known languages.
2. It counts the occurrences of each language known by the scientists.
3. It reads the list of movies with their audio and subtitle languages.
4. The program attempts to find the best movie based on the criteria mentioned above.

### Potential Issues in the Code
1. **Sorting and Reverse Logic**: The scientists' known languages are sorted in reverse, and the counting logic is designed around this. This could lead to overlooking some languages if they are not well distributed.
   
2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_1` function uses a binary search, but the way the mid index is calculated (`midone = low + (high - low) / 2`) will result in a float division in Python 3, which can lead to an `IndexError` if not handled correctly.

3. **Movie Selection Logic**: The movie selection logic is convoluted and might miss selecting a movie correctly when there are multiple candidates for the maximum number of very pleased scientists and almost satisfied scientists.

### Edge Cases
1. **Single Scientist and Movie**: If there is only one scientist and one movie, the program should correctly return that single movie's index.
2. **All Scientists Know Different Languages**: If no scientist knows either the audio or subtitle of any movie, the program should still return a valid movie index, ideally the first one.
3. **Multiple Movies with Equal Satisfaction**: If multiple movies have the same number of very pleased and almost satisfied scientists, the program should return any of those indices, but it must ensure it checks every movie.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and considering potential edge cases, it seems that the logic for counting "very pleased" and "almost satisfied" scientists is not implemented correctly. The binary search may fail with float indices, and the selection criteria for movies is not explicitly clear or robust enough to handle all potential cases.

Thus, I conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
