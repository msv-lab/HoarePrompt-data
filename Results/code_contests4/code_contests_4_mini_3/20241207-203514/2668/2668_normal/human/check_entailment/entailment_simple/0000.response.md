Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Movie Selection**: The program attempts to find the best movie by checking the languages known by scientists and comparing them to the audio and subtitle languages of the movies. However, the logic used to determine which movie maximizes the "very pleased" and "almost satisfied" scientists is not correctly implemented. The algorithm should count how many scientists are very pleased and almost satisfied for each movie, then select the movie that maximizes these counts in the specified order. This is not done in the provided functions.

2. **Binary Search Misuse**: The `func_1` function is designed for a binary search, but it is incorrectly used to find matching languages. The implementation does not properly take advantage of the sorted structure of input languages and does not handle the counts of satisfied scientists.

3. **Output Handling**: The output of the program does not correctly reflect the index of the selected movie as specified by the problem description. The selection logic is flawed, leading to potentially incorrect outputs.

4. **Inefficiency and Incorrect Data Handling**: The program tries to handle the counts of languages in a convoluted way, which may lead to incorrect results or inefficiencies given the constraints (up to 200,000 scientists and movies).

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the movie that maximizes the number of pleased scientists. The counting mechanism, selection criteria, and output generation do not align with the requirements set out in the problem description.
