The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a list of lists `lis1` where each sublist contains at least two integers, a positive integer `low`, and a positive integer `high`. It performs a binary search to find `num` in the first element of the sublists in `lis1`. If `num` is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the second element of the sublist where `num` was found. If `num` is not found within the specified range, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1. The function assumes that `low` is less than or equal to `high` and does not handle cases where `lis1` is empty or contains sublists with fewer than two elements.
