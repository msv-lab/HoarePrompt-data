The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of scientists and a list `a` of `n` integers indicating the languages known by each scientist. It also accepts a positive integer `m`, a list `b` of `m` integers representing the audio language indices of movies, and a list `c` of `m` integers representing the subtitles language indices of those movies. The function determines if there exists a scientist who can understand both the audio and subtitle languages of any movie. If such a scientist exists, it outputs their index; otherwise, it outputs 1. The function also handles input from a file named 'input.txt' or from standard input and writes the output to 'output.txt' or standard output.
