The variable `subs` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values to integers. The input consists of space-separated numbers read from `input.readline()`. Other variables such as `uniques`, `m`, and `audio` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the initialization of `subs` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order, `m` is an input integer, `audio` is a list of integers based on the input, `subs` is a list of integers based on input values.**
