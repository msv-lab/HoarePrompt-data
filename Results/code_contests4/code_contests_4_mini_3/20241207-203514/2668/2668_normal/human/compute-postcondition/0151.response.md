Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements. If the first element of `audio` at index `2` is equal to `uniques[len(uniques)]`, then `back` is assigned the output of `func_1(uniques[len(uniques)][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `subs` has at least 3 elements, `templis` is updated to `[(subs[2], 3), (subs[1], 2), (subs[2], 3)]`, `i` is equal to `len(uniques)`, `res` is True, and `anss` is equal to `back`, while `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`.***
