Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `counts` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `uniques` contains the first tuple from `counts` appended with the second tuple from `counts`, `i` is 1, `x` is the second tuple in `counts`. If `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`, `uniques` is updated to include `counts[1]`.***
