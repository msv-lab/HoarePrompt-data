The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Given that `back` has its first element as True, the value of `anss` will also be True. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with the parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, `0`, and `len(subs) - 1`; `subs` is sorted in ascending order; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `res` is True; `anss` is True; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1; `i` is 0; and the first element of `back` is True.
