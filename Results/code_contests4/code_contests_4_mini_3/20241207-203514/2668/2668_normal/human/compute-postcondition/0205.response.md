Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element. If `res` is True, then `anss` is the last successful output of `func_1`, `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`, and `output` is assigned the value of `anss[1]`. If `res` is False, then `anss` retains its initial value of 0, `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`, and `output` is set to 1. Additionally, the file 'output.txt' exists.***
