Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`) for each index `y` where `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, `i` remains 0, `back` retains the initial value returned from `func_1(uniques[0][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` remains True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
