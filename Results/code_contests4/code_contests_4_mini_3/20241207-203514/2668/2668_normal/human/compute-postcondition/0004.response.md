Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `b` is a list of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ bj ≤ 10^9), and `c` is a list of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ cj ≤ 10^9). If the file 'input.txt' exists, it is opened for reading. Otherwise, the file 'input.txt' does not exist.***
