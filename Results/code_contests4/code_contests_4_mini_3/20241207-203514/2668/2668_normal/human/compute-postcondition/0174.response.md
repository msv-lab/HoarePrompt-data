Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements. If `back[0]` is True, then `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)` for the last value of `z`, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each index `y`, `i` is less than `len(uniques)`, `res` is True indicating that at least one call to `func_1` returned True, and `anss` is the last value of `back` where `back[0]` was True or the value from the last iteration if none were True, with `z` equal to `len(uniques) - 1`. If `back[0]` is False, the program does not proceed to any further actions within the if statement.***
