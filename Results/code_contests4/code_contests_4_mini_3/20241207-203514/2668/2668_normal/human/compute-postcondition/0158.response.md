The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each index `y`; `i` is less than `len(uniques)`; `res` is True; `anss` is True; `z` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
