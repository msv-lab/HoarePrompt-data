Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `back` is assigned the output of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of elements from `subs` and their corresponding 1-based index in `audio`; `i` is equal to `len(uniques)`; `res` is True if any of the calls to `func_1` returned True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last iteration; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1.**
