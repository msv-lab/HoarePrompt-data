The value of `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Since `back` is the value returned from `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, the state of `anss` will be equal to that returned value. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `i` is 0; `back` is the value returned from `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `z` is 2; `res` is True; `anss` is equal to the returned value from `func_1`.**
