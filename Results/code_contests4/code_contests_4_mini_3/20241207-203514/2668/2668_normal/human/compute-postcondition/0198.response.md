To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we must consider the behavior of the loop as described:

1. The loop iterates over the range of the length of `uniques`.
2. During each iteration, it invokes `func_1` with parameters based on the current element of `uniques`.
3. If `back[0]` returns `True`, it sets `res` to `True`, assigns `anss` the value of `back`, and breaks out of the loop. If no iterations find `back[0]` to be `True`, `res` remains `False`, and `anss` retains its initial value.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state after all iterations can be determined as follows:

- If at least one call to `func_1` returned `True`, `res` will be `True`, and `anss` will contain the last successful output of `func_1`. The value of `z` will still be `len(uniques) - 1`, and `uniques` will remain sorted in descending order.
- If no call to `func_1` returned `True`, `res` will remain `False`, `anss` will still be `0`, and `z` will be `len(uniques) - 1`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is as follows:

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `res` is True if any call to `func_1` returned True, otherwise False, `anss` is the last successful output of `func_1` or 0, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1.`**
