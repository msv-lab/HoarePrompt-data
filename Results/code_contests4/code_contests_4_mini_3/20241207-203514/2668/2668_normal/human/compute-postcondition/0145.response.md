Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `back` is assigned the output of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains `[(subs[y], y + 1)]`; `i` is equal to `len(uniques)`; `res` is True; `anss` is equal to `back`; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1; `y` is initialized to 0; the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.***
