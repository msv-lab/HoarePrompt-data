Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and if `back[0]` is True, `res` remains True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
