The variable `res` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, but we note that `res` now holds this new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `back` is assigned the return value of `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`, and `res` is True.
