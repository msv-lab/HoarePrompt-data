Given the initial state where `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `res` is True, `anss` is the last successful output of `func_1`, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`, we analyze the code snippet:

```
output = anss[1]
```

In this code, `output` is assigned the value of the second element in the `anss` list (indexed at 1). The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `anss` must have at least 2 elements since we are accessing the index 1. 

The impact of this code is that `output` will now contain the value of the second element in the `anss` list. Other variables (`uniques`, `res`, `z`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `res` is True; `anss` is the last successful output of `func_1`; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1; `output` is assigned the value of `anss[1]`.

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `res` is True; `anss` is the last successful output of `func_1`; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1; `output` is assigned the value of `anss[1]`.**
