The code appends a tuple `(1, init[i])` to the list `counts`. The variable `i` is 1, and `init` is a list sorted in descending order, so `init[i]` references the second element of `init`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `init`, and `counts` now contains the tuple (1, `init[1]`).**
