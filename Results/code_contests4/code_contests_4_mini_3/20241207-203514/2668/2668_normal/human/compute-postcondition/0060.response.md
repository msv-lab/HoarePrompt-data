According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `uniques`. If `uniques` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start from 0 for the first iteration. 

To ensure the loop executes, `uniques` must not be empty, which means it should have at least one element. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
