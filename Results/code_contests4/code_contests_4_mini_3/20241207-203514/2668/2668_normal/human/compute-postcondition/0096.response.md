Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `i` is 0; `back` retains the value returned from the last call to `func_1` for the last index of `uniques`; `res` is True if `back[0]` was True for any iteration, otherwise it remains False; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last successful iteration, or retains its initial value if no successful iteration occurred; `z` is the length of `uniques`.**
