Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `counts` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `uniques` contains the first tuple from `counts` appended with `counts[i]`, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first tuple in `counts`. If the second element of `counts[i]` is not equal to the second element of `counts[i + 1]`, then `uniques` is updated to include `counts[i]`. Otherwise, no changes occur, and the program continues without modification.***
