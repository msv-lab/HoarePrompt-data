Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `i` is 0; `back` retains the value returned from `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. If `back[0]` is true, `res` remains True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `z` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
