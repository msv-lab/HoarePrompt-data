Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `back` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of elements from `subs` and their corresponding 1-based index in `audio` where `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`; `i` is 1; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `z` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time; and the first element of `back` is True.**
