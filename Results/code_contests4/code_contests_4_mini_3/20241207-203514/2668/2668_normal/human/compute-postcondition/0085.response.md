The value of `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The variable `z` is 1, which means it fetches the second element from `uniques`, specifically `uniques[1][1]`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `i` is 0; `back` retains the value returned from `func_1(uniques[0][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `res` remains True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `z` is 1; `back` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`.
