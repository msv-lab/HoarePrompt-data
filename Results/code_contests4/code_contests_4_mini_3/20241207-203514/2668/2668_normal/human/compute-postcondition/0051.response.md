Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `counts` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `uniques` now contains the tuple at index 2 from `counts`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third tuple in `counts`. If the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `counts` is not equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1`, the program proceeds with the execution; otherwise, there are no further actions taken in this block.***
