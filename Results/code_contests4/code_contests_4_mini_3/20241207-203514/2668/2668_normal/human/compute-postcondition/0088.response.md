The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `i` is 0; `back` retains the value returned from `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `z` is 1; `back` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` again and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
