`templis` is modified by appending a new tuple containing the values `subs[y]` and `y + 1`. Here, `y` is 1, so `y + 1` equals 2. The value of `subs[y]` corresponds to the second element of `subs`. Therefore, after execution, a new tuple `(subs[1], 2)` is added to `templis`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `back` is assigned the output of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` now contains `[(subs[y], y + 1), (subs[1], 2)]`; `i` is equal to `len(uniques)`; `res` is True; `anss` is equal to `back`; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1; `y` is 1; the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `subs` must have at least 2 elements.**
