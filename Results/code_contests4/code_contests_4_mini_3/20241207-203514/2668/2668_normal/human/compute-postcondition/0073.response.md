According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `subs`. If `y` is less than the length of `subs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` has been incremented to `y + 1`, which means `y` is now one more than its value at the beginning of the last iteration. Given that `subs` has at least `y + 2` elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `subs` must have at least `y + 3` elements. 

Therefore, after the last iteration, `y` must be incremented further by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `subs` has at least `y + 3` elements, `y` is now incremented to `y + 2`**
