The code appends a tuple containing the second element of `subs` (which is `subs[y]`) and `y + 1` to the list `templis`. Given that `y` is 1, `subs[y]` refers to the second element of `subs`. The value of `y + 1` will be 2. The previous state of `templis` is `[(subs[0], 1)]`, and after executing the code, it will now include the newly appended tuple.

Therefore, the Output State is: `templis` is now [(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)], `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `y` is 1, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.

Output State: **`templis` is now [(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)], `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `y` is 1, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back**.
