Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `init`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, then `(counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1, init[i])` is appended to `counts`. Otherwise, `counts` now contains the tuple (1, `init[1]`).***
