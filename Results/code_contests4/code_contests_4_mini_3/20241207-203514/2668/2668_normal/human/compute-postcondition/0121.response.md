Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `back` contains a value where the first element is True; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of elements from `subs` and their corresponding 1-based index in `audio` where `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`; `i` is 1; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; and `z` is 0, indicating the loop has executed the first time and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
