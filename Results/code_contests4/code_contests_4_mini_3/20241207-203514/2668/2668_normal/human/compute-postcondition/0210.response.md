The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, `m`, `b`, and `c`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of scientists (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000).
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) represents the language index known by the i-th scientist.
- `m` is a positive integer that represents the number of movies (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000).
- `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, where each integer (1 ≤ bj ≤ 10^9) represents the audio language index of the j-th movie.
- `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, where each integer (1 ≤ cj ≤ 10^9) represents the subtitles language index of the j-th movie, with the guarantee that for each movie, bj ≠ cj.

The function does not return a value directly stated in the output, but it processes the input parameters based on the relationships described. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, `m`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is the number of scientists, `a` is the list of language indices known by the scientists, `m` is the number of movies, and `b` and `c` are lists of audio and subtitles language indices of the movies respectively.**
