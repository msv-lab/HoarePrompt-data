Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `back` retains the value returned from the last call to `func_1`, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, if `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, then `templis` is updated to [(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2), (subs[2], 3)], `y` is 2, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.***
