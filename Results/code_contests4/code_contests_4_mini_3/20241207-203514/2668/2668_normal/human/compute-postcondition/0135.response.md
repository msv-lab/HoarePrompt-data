Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `back` contains the output of the last call to `func_1` for the last element of `uniques`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of elements from `subs` and their corresponding 1-based index in `audio` where `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`; `i` is the final index for `uniques`; `res` is True if any of the calls to `func_1` returned True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last iteration; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`, indicating the loop has executed for all elements of `uniques` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
