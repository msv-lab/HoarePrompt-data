The code appends a new tuple to the `templis` list. The new tuple consists of the value of `subs[y]` and `y + 1`. Given that `y` is 2, this means we are adding `(subs[2], 3)` to `templis`. The previous state of `templis` is `[(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)]`, so after the execution, `templis` will now include the new element.

The values of the other variables (`uniques`, `back`, `subs`, `y`, and `anss`) remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `templis`.

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `back` retains the value returned from the last call to `func_1`, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` is now [(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2), (subs[2], 3)], `y` is 2, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
