Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element of `init`. If `init[i]` equals `init[i - 1]`, `counts` is updated by appending a tuple where the first element is the incremented value of the first element from the last tuple in `counts`, and the second element is `init[2]`. Otherwise, `counts` is appended with the tuple (1, `init[2]`).***
