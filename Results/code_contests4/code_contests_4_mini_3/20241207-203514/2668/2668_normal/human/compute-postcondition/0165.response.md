Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each index `y`; `i` is less than `len(uniques)`; `res` is True; `anss` is the value of `back`; `z` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `back[0]` is True. If `back[0]` is True, then the conditions stated are maintained, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
