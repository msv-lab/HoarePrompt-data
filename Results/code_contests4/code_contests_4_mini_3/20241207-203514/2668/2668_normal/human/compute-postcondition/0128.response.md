According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `uniques` list. If `z` is less than `len(uniques)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `uniques` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if the last value of `z` was `len(uniques) - 1`, the loop would not execute again. However, if `z` was less than that, it would execute again for the next value of `z`.

Assuming `z` was at most `len(uniques) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `z` should be equal to 2 (if there are at least 3 elements in `uniques`).

State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute a second time `uniques` must have at least 3 elements, `z` is 2, `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`**
