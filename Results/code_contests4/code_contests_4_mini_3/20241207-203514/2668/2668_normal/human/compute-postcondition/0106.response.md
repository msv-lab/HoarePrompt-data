The code appends a tuple consisting of `subs[y]` and `y + 1` to the list `templis`. Given that `y` is 0, `subs[y]` refers to `subs[0]`, which is the first element of `subs`. The value of `y + 1` is 1. The previous state of `templis` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `templis` will contain one tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `back` retains the value returned from the last call to `func_1`, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` is now [(subs[0], 1)], `i` is 1, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `z` is the length of `uniques`, `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1); anss is back, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and the first element of `audio` equals `uniques[i][1]`.**
