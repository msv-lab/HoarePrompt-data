Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `init`, and we append `(counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1, init[i])` to `counts`.**
