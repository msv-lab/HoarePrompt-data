Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element. If no calls to `func_1` returned True, then `res` is False, `anss` retains its initial value of 0, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`. If any call to `func_1` returned True, then `res` is True, `anss` is the last successful output of `func_1`, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1.***
