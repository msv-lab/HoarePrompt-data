Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `back` is the last output of `func_1` that returned True, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`) for indices where `audio[y][0]` matches `uniques[i][1]`, `i` is the index of the last processed element in `uniques`, `res` is False indicating that no calls to `func_1` returned True, `anss` retains its initial value of 0, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1` if all iterations were completed.***
