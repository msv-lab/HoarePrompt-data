The variable `uniques` is assigned a new sorted value, which is the result of sorting the original `uniques` in descending order. The previous state of `uniques` is a list of tuples, and after sorting, it remains a list of tuples but in a different order. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `init`, `counts`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order**
