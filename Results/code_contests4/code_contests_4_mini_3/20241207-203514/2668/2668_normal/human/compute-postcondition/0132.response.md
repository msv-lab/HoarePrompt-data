The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `z` is 2; `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
