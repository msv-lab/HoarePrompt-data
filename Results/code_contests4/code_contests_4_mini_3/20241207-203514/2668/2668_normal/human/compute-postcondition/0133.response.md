Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `z` is 2, and `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. If `back[0]` is True, then `res` is set to True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
