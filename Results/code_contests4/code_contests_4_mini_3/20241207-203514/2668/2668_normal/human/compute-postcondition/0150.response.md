The code appends a new tuple to the list `templis`. The new tuple consists of the value from `subs` at index `y` and the value `y + 1`. Given that `y` is 2, the value from `subs` at index 2 is `subs[2]`, and `y + 1` evaluates to 3. The existing contents of `templis` are `[(subs[y], y + 1), (subs[1], 2)]`.

After executing the code, `templis` will now contain an additional element, making the new state of `templis` equal to `[(subs[y], y + 1), (subs[1], 2), (subs[2], 3)]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `back` is assigned the output of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `subs` has at least 3 elements, `templis` is now `[(subs[y], y + 1), (subs[1], 2), (subs[2], 3)]`, `i` is equal to `len(uniques)`, `res` is True, `anss` is equal to `back`, `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`, `y` is 2, and the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.
