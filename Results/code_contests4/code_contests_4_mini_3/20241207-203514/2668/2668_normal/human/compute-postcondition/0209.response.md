Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element. If the file 'output.txt' exists, and if `res` is True, then `output` is assigned the value of `anss[1]` and the string representation of `output` is written to 'output.txt'. If `res` is False, then `output` is set to 1 and this value is also written to 'output.txt'. If the file 'output.txt' does not exist, `output` is assigned `anss[1]` if `res` is True, or 1 if `res` is False, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`.***
