Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `counts` contains tuples of the form (count, value) where `value` is an element from `init`, `uniques` contains tuples from `counts` where each tuple's second element is unique (i.e., not equal to the second element of the following tuple), and the length of `uniques` is at most equal to the number of unique values in `counts`.**
