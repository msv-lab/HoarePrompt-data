Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `back` retains the value returned from the last call to `func_1` for the last index of `uniques`. If `back[0]` is True, then `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`), `i` is 0, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last successful iteration or retains its initial value if no successful iteration occurred, and `z` is the length of `uniques`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
