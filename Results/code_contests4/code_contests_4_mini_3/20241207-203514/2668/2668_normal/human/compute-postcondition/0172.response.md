Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)` for the last value of `z`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each index `y`; `i` is less than `len(uniques)`; `res` is True or False depending on whether any `back[0]` was True; `anss` is the last value of `back` where `back[0]` was True or the value from the last iteration if none were True; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`.**
