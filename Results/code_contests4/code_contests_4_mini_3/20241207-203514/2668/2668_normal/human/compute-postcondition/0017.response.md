Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `init`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, `counts` is updated with a new tuple where the first element is the previous count incremented by 1 and the second element is `x`. Otherwise, `counts` includes the tuple `(1, init[0])`.***
