Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `back` contains the output of the last call to `func_1` for the last element of `uniques`, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of elements from `subs` and their corresponding 1-based index in `audio`, `i` is the final index for `uniques`, `res` is True if any of the calls to `func_1` returned True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last iteration, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed for all elements of `uniques` and the most internal loop or if statement has been exited. If `back[0]` evaluates to True, the program state reflects that the conditions leading to this True evaluation have been met.***
