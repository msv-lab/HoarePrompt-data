`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is already assigned the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `back` is the output of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` is a list of tuples; `i` is 1; `res` is True; `anss` is the same as `back`; `z` is 1; `res` remains True.
