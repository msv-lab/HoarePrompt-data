Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element. If the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to the second element of `uniques` at index `i`, then `back` retains the initial value returned from `func_1(uniques[0][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` remains True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and `templis` contains one tuple: (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`).***
