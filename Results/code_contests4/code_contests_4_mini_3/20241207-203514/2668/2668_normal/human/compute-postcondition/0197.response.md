Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, and `back` has been assigned the return value of `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`. If `back[0]` is True, then `res` is set to True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
