The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `i` is 1; `back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
