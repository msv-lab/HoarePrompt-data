According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and the length of the `subs` list. If `y` is less than the length of `subs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is equal to the current iteration index, which is less than the length of `subs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is that `y` will be `y + 1`, and the loop will be able to execute as long as `y` is less than the length of `subs`.

State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute one more time `subs` must have at least `y + 2` elements, and `y` is incremented to `y + 1`.**
