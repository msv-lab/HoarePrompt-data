The variable `audio` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of splitting a line of input. The specifics of the input are not provided, so the values in `audio` depend on the user input. The variable `uniques` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order; `m` is an input integer; `audio` is a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order; `m` is an input integer; `audio` is a list of integers based on the input.**
