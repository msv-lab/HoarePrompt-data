Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`), `i` is 0, `back` retains the value returned from `func_1(uniques[0][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` remains True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `z` is 0, and `back` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; if `back[0]` is True, the loop or most internal condition is exited without further modification to `res`, `anss`, or `back`.***
