Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `back` retains the value returned from the last call to `func_1`, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` is now [(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)] if `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`, `y` is 1, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. If the condition is not met, `templis` remains unchanged.***
