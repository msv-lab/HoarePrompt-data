The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements; `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `i` is 0; `back` is the value returned from `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `z` is 2; `res` is True; `anss` is equal to the returned value from `func_1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
