Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a list of integers parsed from input and sorted in descending order containing at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `init`, and the first element of `init` is not equal to the second element (i.e., `init[0] != init[1]`).***
