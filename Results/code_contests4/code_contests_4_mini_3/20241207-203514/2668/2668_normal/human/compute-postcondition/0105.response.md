Postcondition: ***`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `back` retains the value returned from the last call to `func_1`, `subs` has at least `len(audio)` elements, `templis` is now an empty list, `i` is 1, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `z` is the length of `uniques`, `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1); anss is back, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and the first element of `audio` equals `uniques[i][1]`.***
