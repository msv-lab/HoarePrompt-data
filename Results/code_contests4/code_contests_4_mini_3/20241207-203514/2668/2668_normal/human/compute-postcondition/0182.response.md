Output State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element; `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with the parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, `0`, and `len(subs) - 1`; `subs` is sorted in ascending order; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `res` is True; `anss` retains its initial value of 0; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1; `i` is 0; and the first element of `back` is True.**
