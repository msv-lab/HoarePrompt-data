According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `uniques`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(uniques)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `uniques` has at least 1 element, `len(uniques)` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `len(uniques)` must be greater than 1.

State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute a second time `len(uniques)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
