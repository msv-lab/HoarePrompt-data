According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `uniques` list. At the end of the last iteration, `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The length of `uniques` must be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `len(uniques)` must be greater than 2**
