#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer representing the number of scientists, lis1 is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the language known by each scientist, low is a positive integer representing the number of movies, and high is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the index of audio languages for the movies and another list representing the index of subtitle languages for the movies.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, indicating that the search range is exhausted. If `num` was found to be equal to any `lis1[midone][0]`, the function would return True along with `lis1[midone][1]`. If `num` was not found, the function would not return a tuple, and `low` is greater than `high` while `num` remains a positive integer and `lis1` is a list of positive integers.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False along with -1, indicating that the number num was not found in the search range represented by the list lis1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a list of lists `lis1` where each sublist contains at least two integers, a positive integer `low`, and a positive integer `high`. It performs a binary search to find `num` in the first element of the sublists in `lis1`. If `num` is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the second element of the sublist where `num` was found. If `num` is not found within the specified range, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1. The function assumes that `low` is less than or equal to `high` and does not handle cases where `lis1` is empty or contains sublists with fewer than two elements.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of scientists and a list `a` of `n` integers indicating the languages known by each scientist. It also accepts a positive integer `m`, a list `b` of `m` integers representing the audio language indices of movies, and a list `c` of `m` integers representing the subtitles language indices of those movies. The function determines if there exists a scientist who can understand both the audio and subtitle languages of any movie. If such a scientist exists, it outputs their index; otherwise, it outputs 1. The function also handles input from a file named 'input.txt' or from standard input and writes the output to 'output.txt' or standard output.
