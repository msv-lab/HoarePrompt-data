Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of scientists; a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) where each ai represents the language index known by the i-th scientist; m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) representing the number of movies; b is a list of m positive integers (1 ≤ bj ≤ 10^9) where each bj represents the audio language index of the j-th movie; c is a list of m positive integers (1 ≤ cj ≤ 10^9) where each cj represents the subtitles language index of the j-th movie, with the guarantee that for each movie, bj ≠ cj.**
