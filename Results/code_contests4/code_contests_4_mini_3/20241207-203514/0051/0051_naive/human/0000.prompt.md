You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This problem differs from the previous one only in the absence of the constraint on the equal length of all numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.

Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers f(a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - 1} b_q), where a_1 ... a_p and b_1 ... b_q are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.

In other words, the function f(x, y) alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers x and y by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number y. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.

For example: $$$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212 f(7777, 888) = 7787878 f(33, 44444) = 4443434 f(555, 6) = 5556 f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$$

Formally,

  * if p ≥ q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q; 
  * if p < q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q. 



Mishanya gives you an array consisting of n integers a_i, your task is to help students to calculate ∑_{i = 1}^{n}∑_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j) modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of elements in the array. The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
