The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `zero`. `zero` is a non-negative integer. The function processes an input string `s` to return a list `A` that contains integers parsed from `s`. If `s` is not empty and the last character of `s` has an ASCII value greater than or equal to that of '0', then the integer 0 is appended to the list `A`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `zero` and return a list of integers parsed from the input string `s`, with an additional condition for appending 0 based on the content of `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter zero and returns a list A of integers parsed from the input string s, and appends 0 to A if s is not empty and the last character of s has an ASCII value greater than or equal to '0'.**
