Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states, and we can simply repeat the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`us[i]` has been updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; if `x` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is greater than 0, then `x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1.**
