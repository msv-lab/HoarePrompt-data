The value of `x` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `x` without specific values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`, `x` is decreased by 1.**
