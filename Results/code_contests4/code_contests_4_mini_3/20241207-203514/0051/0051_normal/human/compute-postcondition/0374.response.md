The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` is greater than 1, the new value of `x` will be `x - 1`, which remains greater than 0. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `res`, and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`; `j` is 0.
