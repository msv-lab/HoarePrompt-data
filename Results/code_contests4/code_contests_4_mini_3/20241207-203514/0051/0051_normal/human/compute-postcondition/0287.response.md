The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `ans`, `res`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is -1; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated based on the final expression after all iterations; `j` is equal to 0.
