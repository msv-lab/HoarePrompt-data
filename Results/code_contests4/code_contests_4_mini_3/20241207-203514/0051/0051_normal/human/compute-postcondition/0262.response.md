According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop starts at `j = x - 1` and decrements `j` until it reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `x - 1`, meaning the loop has executed once with `j` at this value. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased to `x - 2` before the next iteration starts. Hence, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `x - 2`.

Since `x` is the length of `item`, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2 (so that `j` does not go out of bounds after decrement). 

Therefore, we need to state that `j` is now `x - 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is the length of `item` such that `x ≥ 2`; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated; `j` is `x - 2`.**
