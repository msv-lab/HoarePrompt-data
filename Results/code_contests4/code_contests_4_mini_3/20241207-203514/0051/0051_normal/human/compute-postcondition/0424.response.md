To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000
- `i` is 2
- `x` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2

The code snippet is:
```
res = (res + 2 * int(item[j]) * pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod)) % mod
```

In this code:
- The variable `res` is updated using its previous value along with a computation involving `item[j]`, `x`, `i`, and `mod`.
- The expression `pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod)` calculates a power of 10 modulo `mod`.

However, we do not have specific values for `res`, `item[j]`, or `mod`, nor do we know what `j` is. The operation will depend on these values, but we can summarize the impact as follows:

1. The value of `res` changes based on the formula involving `item[j]`, but since we do not have the exact values for `res`, `item[j]`, or `mod`, we cannot specify the new value of `res`.
2. The calculations will maintain the relationship of the other variables, but the exact output state of `res` cannot be determined without knowing `item[j]`, `mod`, and the initial value of `res`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `res` is updated based on the computation, while the exact values remain undetermined.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the computation involving `item[j]`, `x`, `i`, and `mod`; specific values of `res`, `item[j]`, and `mod` are unknown.**
