The variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res` to it. The value of `arr[i - 1]` is determined by the current value of `i`, which remains unchanged, and `res` has been previously updated based on the final expressions involving `item`, `i`, `x`, and `mod`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `x`) do not affect this operation directly and remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is -1 after the loop execution; `i` is unchanged; `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `x` is the length of `item`; `ans` is updated based on `arr[i - 1] * res`.

Output State: **`j` is -1 after the loop execution; `i` is unchanged; `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `x` is the length of `item`; `ans` is updated based on `arr[i - 1] * res.**
