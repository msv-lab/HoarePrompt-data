According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than `i`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and since `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `x` must remain greater than `i`, which is currently 1.

Since `x` is greater than 1, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute for the first time. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 1; `res` is 0; `j` is 0**
