The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 3, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, and `res`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is greater than 3 and now decreased by 1; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is greater than 3 and now decreased by 1; `res` is 0**
