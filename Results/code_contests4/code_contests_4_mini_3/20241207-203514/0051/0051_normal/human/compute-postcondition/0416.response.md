After executing the code `x -= 1`, the value of `x` is decremented by 1. Given that `x` is greater than 3, this means `x` will now be at least 3. The values of `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 3; `x` is greater than 3 and now decreased by 1; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 3; `x` is greater than 3 and now decreased by 1; `res` is 0.**
