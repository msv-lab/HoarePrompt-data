According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop can execute if `x` is greater than `i`. Right before the loop, `i` is 10, and `x` is undefined. For the loop to execute for the first time, `x` must be defined and greater than 10. Thus, we need to adjust `x` to ensure that it is greater than 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 10; for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be defined and greater than 10**
