In the provided code snippet, `j` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect the previous values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, and `res`). Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `j` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is greater than 3 and now decreased by 1; `res` is 0; `j` is 0**
