The expression `x -= x & -x` modifies the value of `x`. The operation `x & -x` isolates the lowest set bit of `x`. The value of `x` is decremented by this isolated bit. However, since the initial value of `x` was not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `x`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[zs[i]]`; `x` is modified by subtracting the lowest set bit.**
