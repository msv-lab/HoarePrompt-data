`i` is decremented by 1, and since the initial value of `i` is 2, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 1; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 1; `res` is 0**
