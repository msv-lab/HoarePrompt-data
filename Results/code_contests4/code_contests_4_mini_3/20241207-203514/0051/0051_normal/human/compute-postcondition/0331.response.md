`x` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`; `x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`; `x` is decreased by 1.**
