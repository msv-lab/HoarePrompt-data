The variable `x` is updated using the expression `x += x & -x`. The initial value of `x` is `zs[i] + 1`. The expression `x & -x` calculates the lowest set bit of `x`. After performing this operation, `x` will have this lowest set bit added to its previous value. Other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `x + (x & -x)`; `ts[x - 1]` is updated accordingly before this operation, but that does not change as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `x + (x & -x)`; `ts[x - 1]` is updated by adding 1.**
