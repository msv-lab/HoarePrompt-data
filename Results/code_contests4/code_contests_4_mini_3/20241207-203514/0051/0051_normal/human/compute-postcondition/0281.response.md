The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than -1; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated based on the expression; `j` is 2**
