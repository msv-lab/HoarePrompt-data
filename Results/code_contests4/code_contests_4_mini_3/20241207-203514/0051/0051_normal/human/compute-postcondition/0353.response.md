The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 2, and `x` is the length of the next `item`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
