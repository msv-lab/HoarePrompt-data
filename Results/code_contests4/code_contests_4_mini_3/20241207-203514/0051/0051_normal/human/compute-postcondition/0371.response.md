The variable `j` is initialized to 0, and the previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. The states of `n`, `i`, `x`, and `res` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 1; `res` is 0; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 1; `res` is 0; `j` is 0**
