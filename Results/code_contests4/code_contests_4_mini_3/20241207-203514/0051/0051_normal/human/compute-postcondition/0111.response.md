Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute indefinitely without any condition to break out of it. Therefore, there are no states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[zs[i]]`; `x` is updated to the value `zs[i] + 1`, and the execution continues with the updated value of `x`.**
