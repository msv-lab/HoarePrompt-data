Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `item` is the 11th string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations from all iterations, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` contains the final computed value based on the characters of `item` processed during the loop, and the element at index `i - 1` of `arr` is equal to 0.***
