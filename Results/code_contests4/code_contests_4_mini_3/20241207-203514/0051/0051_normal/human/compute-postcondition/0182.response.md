Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `item` is the 11th string in `l1`; `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations from all iterations; `i` is 0; `x` is the length of `item` - 1; `res` is updated to (0 + 2 * int(item[0]) * pow(10, x + 1, mod)) % mod; `j` is 0**
