The value of `i` is decremented by 1, and since the initial value of `i` is 1, after execution, `i` becomes 0. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `ans`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than 0; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than 0; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is 0**
