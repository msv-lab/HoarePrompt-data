Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is at least 2 less than the initial value of `x`; `res` is updated based on computations involving all elements of `item` up to `j` where `j` is equal to the initial value of `x` minus 2; `j` is equal to the initial value of `x` minus 1.**
