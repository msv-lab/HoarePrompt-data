Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is equal to the initial value of `x` minus 1 for each iteration until it equals `i`, which means `x` is now equal to 1; `res` is updated based on the sum of calculations involving `item[j]` for each iteration, with the final value of `res` reflecting the cumulative result of those calculations modulo `mod`; `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations executed, which is equal to the initial value of `x - i`.**
