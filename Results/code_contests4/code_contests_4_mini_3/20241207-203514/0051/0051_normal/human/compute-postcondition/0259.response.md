According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is greater than 0, which is guaranteed since it is given that `x` is the length of `item` and greater than 0. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `x - 1` and decrements down to `0`. 

So, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be set to `x - 1`, and it will count down to `0`. The other states (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `res`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `ans` is unchanged, `res` is 0, `j` is `x - 1`**
