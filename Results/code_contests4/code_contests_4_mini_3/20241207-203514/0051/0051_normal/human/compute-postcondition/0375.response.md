The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`; `j` is 1.
