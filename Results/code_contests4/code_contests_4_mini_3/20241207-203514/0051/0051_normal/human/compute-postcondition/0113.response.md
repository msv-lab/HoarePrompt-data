The expression `x -= x & -x` modifies the value of `x`. The operation `x & -x` isolates the lowest set bit of `x`, and subtracting this value from `x` updates `x` to a new value. The previous value of `x` is not specified, so we cannot provide the exact value of the updated `x`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`, and `x` is updated based on the operation `x -= x & -x`.

Output State: **`us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`, and `x` is updated based on the operation `x -= x & -x`.**
