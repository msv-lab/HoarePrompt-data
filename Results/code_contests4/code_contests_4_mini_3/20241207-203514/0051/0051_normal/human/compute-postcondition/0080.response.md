The value of `x` is updated by adding `x & -x` to it. Since `x` is initially 0, the operation `0 & -0` results in 0. Therefore, `x` remains unchanged at 0 after the operation. The values of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is 0, `us[i]` is updated by adding the values from `ts`, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`**
