The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is the length of `item`, which is defined and greater than 0; `ans` is unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
