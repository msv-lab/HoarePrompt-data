The value of `x` is modified by performing the operation `x -= x & -x`. This operation effectively reduces `x` by the least significant bit of `x`. The previous value of `x` is not specified, so we cannot determine the new value of `x` after this operation. The variable `us[i]` remains unchanged from its previous state as it is not affected by this line. Therefore, the Output State is: `us[i]` has been updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; `x` is modified by the operation but its new value is unknown.

Output State: **`us[i]` has been updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; `x` is modified by the operation but its new value is unknown.**
