The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on a defined context where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for i in range(1, n). The function produces an output based on these constraints.

Since there are no specific outputs or cases given in the output description, we cannot derive detailed return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is not clearly defined from the provided information. 

However, based on the constraints of `n` and `a_i`, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates in a context where `n` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100,000] and each `a_i` is an integer within the range [1, 10^9]. The specific return output is not defined in the provided information.**
