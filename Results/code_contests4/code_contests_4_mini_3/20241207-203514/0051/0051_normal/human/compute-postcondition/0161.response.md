Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `item` is the 11th string in `l1`; `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations from all iterations; `i` is 1; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` contains the final computed value based on the characters of `item` processed during the loop. If the element at index `i - 1` of `arr` is equal to 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without making any changes to `ans`, `res`, or `i`.***
