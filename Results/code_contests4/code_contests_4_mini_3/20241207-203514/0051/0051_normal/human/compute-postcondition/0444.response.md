The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The value of `i` is 3, so `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[2]`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `arr`, `res`, or `ans`, hence we cannot determine their exact values. However, `ans` will be increased by the product of `arr[2]` and `res`. Therefore, the output reflects that `ans` is updated based on the operation.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[2] * res`**
