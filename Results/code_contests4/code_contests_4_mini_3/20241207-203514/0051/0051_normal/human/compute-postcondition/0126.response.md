The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `zs[i] + 1`; `ts[x - 1]` is updated to `ts[x - 1] + 1`; `x` is updated to `x + (x & -x)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
