Since the `while` loop is a `while True`, it will always execute at least one time regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `us[i]` is updated by the sum of `ts[zs[i]]` added multiple times based on the operations performed in the loop**
