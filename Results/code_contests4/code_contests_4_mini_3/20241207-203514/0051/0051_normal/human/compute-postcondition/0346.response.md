According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the range defined for `j`. The loop is set to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop was executed with `j` starting from `0` (i - 1) down to `-1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be at least `0`. Since `j` started at `0`, it would be decremented to `-1`, which indicates that the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, the variable `i` needs to be increased to allow `j` to start from `1` (i - 1) instead of `0`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `j` is -1; `res` is updated based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be at least 0.**
