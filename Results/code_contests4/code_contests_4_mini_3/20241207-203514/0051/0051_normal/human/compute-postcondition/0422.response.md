The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is at least 2; `res` is updated based on the computation involving `item[j]`, `x + 3`, and `mod`; `j` is increased by 1.
