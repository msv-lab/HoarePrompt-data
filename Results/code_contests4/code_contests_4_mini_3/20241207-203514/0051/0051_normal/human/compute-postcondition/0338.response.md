The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `res` is updated based on the calculations involving all elements in `item` up to the initial value of `x`; `x` is 0; `j` is equal to the initial value of `x`.**
