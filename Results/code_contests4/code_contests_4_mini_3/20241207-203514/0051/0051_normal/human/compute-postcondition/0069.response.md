The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `us[i]` has been updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; `x` is modified by the operation but its new value is unknown, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
