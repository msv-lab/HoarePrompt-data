Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 11; `x` is the length of `item`, which is defined and greater than 0. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[10] * res` after calculations involving all elements of `item`. Otherwise, `x` is the length of `item`, `j` is -1, `res` is the final accumulated value after all calculations, `i` is the original value before the loop, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`.***
