Postcondition: ***`conv` is a function based on `py2`, `A` contains the integers parsed from the input `s`, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, and `i` is equal to the length of `s`. If `s` is not empty and the last character of `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', then 0 is appended to `A`.***
