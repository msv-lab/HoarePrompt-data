The value of `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is previously defined as `zs[i] + 1`, so we need to check if `x - 1` is a valid index for `ts`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `ts[x - 1]` is updated to `ts[x - 1] + 1`.

Output State: **`x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `ts[x - 1]` is updated to `ts[x - 1] + 1**.
