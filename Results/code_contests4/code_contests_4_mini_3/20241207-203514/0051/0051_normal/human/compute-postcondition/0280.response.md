The value of `x` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown, only that it is greater than 0. The other variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, `res`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than 0 (now `x` is greater than -1); `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated based on the expression; `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than -1; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated based on the expression; `j` is 1**.
