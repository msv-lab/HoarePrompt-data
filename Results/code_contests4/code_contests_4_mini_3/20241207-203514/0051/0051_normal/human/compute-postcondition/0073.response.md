The value of `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot definitively determine if `x` is less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `us[i]` has been updated, but the state of `x` remains unknown. 

Output State: **`us[i]` has been updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; the value of `x` is unknown.**
