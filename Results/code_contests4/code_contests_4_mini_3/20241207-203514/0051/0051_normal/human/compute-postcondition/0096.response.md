According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `len(xs) - 1` down to `0`. Since `x` is `0` at the end of the last iteration, it indicates that the loop has completed at least one full cycle. The variable `i` starts at `len(xs) - 2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` would have already been updated to `len(xs) - 2 - 1`, which is `len(xs) - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `0`. This means that `len(xs)` must be greater than or equal to `3` so that `i` can be `0` for an additional iteration.

State: **`x` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `xs` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(xs) - 3`**
