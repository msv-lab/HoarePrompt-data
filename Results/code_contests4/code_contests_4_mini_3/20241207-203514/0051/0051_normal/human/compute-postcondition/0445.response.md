Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 3; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is initialized to 0. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, the variable `res` is updated according to a specified formula involving all elements of `item`, and `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2] * res`.***
