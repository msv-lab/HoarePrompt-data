In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to run indefinitely unless a break condition is met within the loop body. Since there is no condition that would prevent the loop from executing again, the loop can certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state.

Therefore, we simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration without making any modifications. 

State: **`x` is 0, `us[i]` is updated by adding the values from `ts`, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`**
