Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; if the length of `item` (the 11th string in `l1`) is at most 1, then `ans` is updated by adding `arr[0] * res` and `res` is updated based on the value of `x`, which is the length of `item` (0 if `x` is 0, or calculated if `x` is 1). Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, and `res` is updated based on all characters in `item`, with `j` being -1 at the end of the loop.***
