According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at `i - 1`, which means for the loop to execute again, `j` must be decremented to `i - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 2.

State: **`res` is updated based on the last character of `item`, `item` is at least 10 characters long, and the calculation involves `pow(10, 1, mod), j is i - 2, for the loop to execute a second time i must be at least 2**
