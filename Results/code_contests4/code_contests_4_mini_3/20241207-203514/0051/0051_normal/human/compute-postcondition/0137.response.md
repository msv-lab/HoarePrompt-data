The function `count_next_smaller_elements` accepts a parameter `xs`. `xs` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, and the length of `xs` is a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000. After executing the function body, it returns a list `us` containing the cumulative sums of counts from another list `ts` corresponding to certain indices defined by a list `zs`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `count_next_smaller_elements` is to accept a list of integers `xs` and return a list `us` that contains cumulative sums of counts based on specified indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `xs` and returns a list `us` containing cumulative sums of counts from another list corresponding to defined indices.**
