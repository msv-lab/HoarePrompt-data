Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned a function based on `py2`, `A` is an empty list. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, `numb` is updated to `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`, `sign` is -1, and `i` remains 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'-'[0]`, `A` is updated to contain the value `sign * numb` while `sign` remains 1 and `i` is still 2. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'\r'[0]`, no changes occur to `A`.***
