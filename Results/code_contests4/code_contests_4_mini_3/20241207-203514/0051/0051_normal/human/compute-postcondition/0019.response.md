Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned a function based on `py2`. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to b'0'[0], then `numb` is assigned a value of either `zero`, `zero + 1`, `zero + 2`, ..., `zero + 9`, `A` remains an empty list, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is equal to b'-'[0], then `sign` is -1, `A` remains an empty list, `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`, and `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is not equal to b'-'[0] and is less than b'0'[0], then `A` is assigned [0], `numb` is 0, `sign` remains 1, and `i` is 0, with `s[i]` not equal to b'-'[0] and not equal to b'\r'[0].***
