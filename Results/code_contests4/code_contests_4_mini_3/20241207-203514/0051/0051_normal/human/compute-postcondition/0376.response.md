According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will execute again if `x` is greater than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is 1). Therefore, the condition for `x` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`, `j` is 1**
