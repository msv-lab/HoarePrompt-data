The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The value of `i` is given as the final value after iterations, and `arr[i - 1]` accesses the element in the `arr` array at the index `i - 1`. The previous values of `ans`, `arr`, and `res` are not provided, but we can note that the calculation will depend on the specific values of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` has been updated based on the current values of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`**
