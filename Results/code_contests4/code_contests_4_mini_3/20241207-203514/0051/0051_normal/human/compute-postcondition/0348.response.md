Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `j` is -1; `res` is updated based on the formula with `j` being -1, so the expression `item[j + (x - i)]` will lead to an index error unless the loop executes one more time; therefore, `j` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute again.**
