Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any of the states provided.

State: **`conv` is assigned a function based on `py2`, `A` remains an empty list, `numb` is updated to `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 2**
