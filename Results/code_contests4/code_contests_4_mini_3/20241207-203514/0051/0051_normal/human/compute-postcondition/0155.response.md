Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with `n` strings, `item` is the first string in `l1`, `i` is 10, `x` is the length of `item`, and `res` is 0. If the length of `item` is less than or equal to 10, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res` based on the values of `arr`, `i`, and `res`. If the length of `item` is greater than 10, `res` is the cumulative result of calculations involving the first 10 characters of `item`, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` to it.***
