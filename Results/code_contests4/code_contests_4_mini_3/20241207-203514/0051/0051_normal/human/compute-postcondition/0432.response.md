The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `res`, `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 3; `x` is at least 2 less than the initial value of `x`; `res` is updated based on computations involving all elements of `item` up to `j` where `j` is equal to the initial value of `x` minus 2; `j` is equal to the initial value of `x` minus 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 3; `x` is at least 2 less than the initial value of `x`; `res` is updated based on computations involving all elements of `item` up to `j` where `j` is equal to the initial value of `x` minus 2; `j` is equal to the initial value of `x` minus 1.**
