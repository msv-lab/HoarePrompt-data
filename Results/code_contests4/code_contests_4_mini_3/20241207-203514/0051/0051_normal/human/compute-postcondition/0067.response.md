The code `us[i] += ts[x - 1]` updates `us[i]` by adding the value of `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value. 

1. We know that `x` is defined as `zs[i] + 1`, which means `x` will have a specific value based on the current index `i`.
2. The variable `us[i]` is updated, but we do not have the previous value for `us[i]` or the specific values of `ts` and `zs`. However, we know that `ts[x - 1]` is being accessed, which will also depend on the current value of `x`.
3. The operation does not affect the other variables (`i`, `x`, etc.) directly; it simply updates the value of `us[i]`.

Since we cannot determine the specific numeric output without the values of `ts`, `zs`, and `us`, we can state the impact of the operation.

Output State: **`us[i]` has been updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value.**
