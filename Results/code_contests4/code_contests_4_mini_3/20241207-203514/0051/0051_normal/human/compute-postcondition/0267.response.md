Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is the length of `item` such that `x ≥ 3`; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated based on the expression `(res + int(item[j]) * pow(10, (x - j) * 2 - 1, mod)) % mod`, where `j` is `x - 3` and `j` is within valid range.**
