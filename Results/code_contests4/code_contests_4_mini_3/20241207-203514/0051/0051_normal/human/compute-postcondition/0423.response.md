According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will execute again if `x` is greater than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `x` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2**
