According to the code, the loop is set to execute while `j` is in the range from `x - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 12 and 100,000, and `x` is greater than 1. 

The variable `j` would have started at `x - 1` during the last iteration and decremented with each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be greater than or equal to `0`. If `j` was `0` in the last iteration, it would be decremented to `-1` for the next iteration, which would terminate the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must have been `0` at the end of the last iteration, and should now be `-1`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `-1` and for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must remain greater than `1` and not affect the range of `j`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 0.**
