The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change any variable values directly but affects the flow of the program. The variables themselves remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `item` is the 11th string in `l1`; `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations from all iterations; `i` is 1; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` contains the final computed value based on the characters of `item` processed during the loop; and the element at index `i - 1` of `arr` is equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
