The value of `x` is updated by performing the operation `x += x & -x`. Since `x` is initially 0, the expression `x & -x` evaluates to 0 (as the bitwise AND of 0 and -0 is 0). Therefore, `x` remains 0 after this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is 0 and remains 0 after the operation.**
