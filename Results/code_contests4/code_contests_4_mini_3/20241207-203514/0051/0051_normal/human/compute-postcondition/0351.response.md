Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, and `x` is the length of the next `item`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[0]` and `res`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`.***
