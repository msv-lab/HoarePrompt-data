Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `j` is 0; `res` is updated based on the last element of `item` multiplied by the modular inverse of `100` under `mod`, and `res` is assigned the value `(res + int(item[j + (x - i)]) * pow(10, (i - j) * 2 - 1, mod)) % mod`.**
