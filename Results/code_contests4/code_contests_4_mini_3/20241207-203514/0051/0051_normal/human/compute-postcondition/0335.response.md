The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `x` is greater than 0, so after execution, `x` will still be greater than 0 (specifically, it will be `x - 1`). The states of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `res` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`; `x` is greater than 0 but now decreased by 1.
