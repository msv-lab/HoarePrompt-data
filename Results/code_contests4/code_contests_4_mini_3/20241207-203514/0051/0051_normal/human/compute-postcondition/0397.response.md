The variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The current value of `i` is 2, so `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[1]`. The values of `arr[1]` and `res` are needed to calculate the new value of `ans`, but since they are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` after this operation. However, the process of updating `ans` is clearly defined.

The output state will indicate the impact of this operation without specifying exact values for `arr[1]` or `res`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[1]` and `res`**
