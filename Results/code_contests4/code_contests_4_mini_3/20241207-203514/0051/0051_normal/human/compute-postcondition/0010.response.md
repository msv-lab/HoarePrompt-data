Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true; otherwise, `conv` is assigned a lambda function that returns its input; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned the value of the input read from `sys.stdin.buffer`; the value of `s[i]` is less than b'0'[0]; the value of `s[i]` is equal to b'-'[0].***
