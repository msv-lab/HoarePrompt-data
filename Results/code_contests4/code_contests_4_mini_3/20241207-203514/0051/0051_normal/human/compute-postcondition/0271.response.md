The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since it is given that `x` is greater than 1, after execution, `x` will still remain greater than 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, and `res`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 0; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is greater than 0; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is 0**
