According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop can execute again if `x` is greater than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 0. Since `x` is greater than -1, it is possible that `x` could be 0 or a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than 0; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated based on the expression; `j` is 2**
