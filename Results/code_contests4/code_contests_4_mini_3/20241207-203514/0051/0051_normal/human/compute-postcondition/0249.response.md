Output State: **`res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j + (x - i)]`, where `x` is the length of `item`, `j` is (length of `item` - 11), `i` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `j` is `i - 2`, which must be greater than or equal to 0; `res` is calculated as `(res + int(item[j + (x - i)]) * pow(10, (i - j - 1) * 2, mod)) % mod`.**
