The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`; `x` is greater than 0 and now decreased by 1; `j` is increased by 1.
