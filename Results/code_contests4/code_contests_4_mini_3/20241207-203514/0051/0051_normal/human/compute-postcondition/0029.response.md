Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned a function based on `py2`, `A` remains an empty list. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, then `numb` is updated to `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`, `sign` remains 1, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is less than `b'0'[0]`, and if `s[i]` equals `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is -1 and `numb` remains unchanged; otherwise, `A` contains `numb`, which can be `zero`, `zero + 1`, `zero + 2`, ..., or `zero + 9`, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0].***
