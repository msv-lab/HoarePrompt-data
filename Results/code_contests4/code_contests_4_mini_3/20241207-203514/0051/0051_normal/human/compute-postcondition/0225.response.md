The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 11, so after execution, `i` will be 10. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 10; `x` is undefined; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 10; `x` is undefined; `res` is 0**
