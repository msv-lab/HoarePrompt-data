The variable `res` is updated according to the formula provided. The formula is:

```
res = (res + int(item[j + (x - i)]) * pow(10, (i - j) * 2 - 1, mod)) % mod
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The variable `j` is 1 and `i` is 3, so `x - i` will depend on the value of `x` which is a positive integer ≥ 2.
2. The term `j + (x - i)` translates to `1 + (x - 3)`, which simplifies to `x - 2`.
3. The expression `int(item[x - 2])` retrieves an integer value from a collection named `item` at the index `x - 2`.
4. The term `pow(10, (i - j) * 2 - 1, mod)` needs to be calculated. Here, `(i - j)` is `3 - 1` which equals `2`, so the expression becomes `pow(10, 2 * 2 - 1, mod)`, which simplifies to `pow(10, 3, mod)`.
5. Finally, `res` is updated with the new calculated value based on the previous value of `res`.

Since the initial values do not specify the actual value of `res` or `mod`, and since `item[x - 2]` is also not defined in this context, I can only summarize the changes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 3; `x` is a positive integer ≥ 2; `j` is 1; `res` is updated according to the formula provided.**
