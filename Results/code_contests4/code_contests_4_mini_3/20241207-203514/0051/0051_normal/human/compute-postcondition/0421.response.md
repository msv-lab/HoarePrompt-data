`x` is decremented by 1. The value of `x` was at least 3, so after execution, `x` will now be at least 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is at least 2; `res` is updated based on the computation involving `item[j]`, `x + 3`, and `mod`.
