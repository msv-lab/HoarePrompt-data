Since the loop condition is `while True`, it guarantees that the loop will execute indefinitely. Therefore, there are no states that need to be modified for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true; otherwise, `conv` is assigned a lambda function that returns its input; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned the value of the input read from `sys.stdin.buffer.**
