Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned a function based on `py2`, `A` remains an empty list, if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is -1, while `numb` remains either `zero`, `zero + 1`, `zero + 2`, ..., `zero + 9`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `A` contains `numb`, where `numb` can be `zero`, `zero + 1`, `zero + 2`, ..., or `zero + 9`, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0].***
