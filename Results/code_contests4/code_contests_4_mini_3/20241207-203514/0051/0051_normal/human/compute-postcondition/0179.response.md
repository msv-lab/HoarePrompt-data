The value of `j` is initialized to 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `item` is the 11th string in `l1`; `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations from all iterations; `i` is 0; `x` is the length of `item`, and the length of `item` is greater than 1; `res` is 0; `j` is 0.
