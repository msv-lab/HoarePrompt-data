The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration without executing any further code in the loop body for this iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 11, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 11, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next iteration.**
