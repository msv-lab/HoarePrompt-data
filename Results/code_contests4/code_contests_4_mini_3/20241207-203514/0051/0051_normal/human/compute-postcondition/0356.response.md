The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged as this line only affects `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is the length of the next `item`; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is the length of the next `item`; `res` is 0**.
