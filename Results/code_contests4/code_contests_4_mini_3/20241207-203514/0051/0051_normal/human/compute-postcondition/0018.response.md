Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned the value of `ord` or a lambda function. If `s[i]` is equal to b'-'[0], then `sign` is -1, while `A` remains an empty list, `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`, and `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is not equal to b'-'[0] and is less than b'0'[0], then `A` is assigned [0], `numb` is 0, `sign` remains 1, and `i` is 0, with `s[i]` not equal to b'-'[0] and not equal to b'\r'[0].***
