After all iterations of the loop have executed, the state of the variables will be as follows: `n` remains a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is still 0; `res` has been updated based on the calculations involving all elements in `item` that corresponded to the range determined by `x`; `x` has been decremented to the point where it is equal to `i`, which is 0; and `j` will have incremented by the total number of iterations executed, which is equal to the initial value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `res` is updated based on the calculations involving all elements in `item` up to the initial value of `x`; `x` is 0; `j` is equal to the initial value of `x`.**
