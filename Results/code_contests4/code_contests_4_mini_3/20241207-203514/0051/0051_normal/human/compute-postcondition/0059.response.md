Since the `while` loop is a `while True`, it will always execute at least one time regardless of the states of `x` and `i`. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute. 

State: **`x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1`, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`, and `len(xs)` is at least 1**
