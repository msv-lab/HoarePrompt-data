The variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The values of `arr`, `res`, and `ans` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine exact values for them. However, since `i` is 1, we are accessing the first element of `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. The previous values of `ans` and `res` would influence the outcome, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state summarizes that `ans` is updated based on these calculations.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[0]` and `res`**
