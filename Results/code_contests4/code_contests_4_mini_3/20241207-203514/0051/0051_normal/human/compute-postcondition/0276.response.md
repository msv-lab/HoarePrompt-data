The value of `x` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown, only that it is greater than 0. Thus, after execution, `x` will still be greater than 0 but will be reduced by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated based on the expression; `j` is 0.
