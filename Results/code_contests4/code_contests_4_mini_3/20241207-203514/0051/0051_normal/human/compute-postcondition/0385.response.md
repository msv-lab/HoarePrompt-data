The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `res`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is 1; `res` reflects the cumulative result of calculations; `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus `x - i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `x` is 1; `res` reflects the cumulative result of calculations; `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus `x - i.**
