According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop executes as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `x - 1`, which is greater than or equal to 0 since `x` is defined and greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `x - 2`. Since `j` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to continue executing, `x` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 11; `x` is defined and greater than 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`, where `j` is `x - 1`; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is `x - 2` and `x` must be at least 2.**
