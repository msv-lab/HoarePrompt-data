The variable `res` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 11; `x` is the length of `item`, which is currently undefined; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 11; `x` is the length of `item`, which is currently undefined; `res` is 0**.
