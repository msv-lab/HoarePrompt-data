According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate from 1 to 10, inclusive. The variable `i` will take on values starting from 1 and going up to 10. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be 10 for the loop to have completed its last iteration, and since the loop condition is defined for `i` in the range from 1 to 11 (exclusive), it will not execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be adjusted to 11, which is outside the current range for the loop. The state of `ans`, `res`, `n`, and `item` does not change in a way that would allow for another iteration because the loop has already completed its intended range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 11, for the loop to execute a second time the range must be adjusted to include 11.**
