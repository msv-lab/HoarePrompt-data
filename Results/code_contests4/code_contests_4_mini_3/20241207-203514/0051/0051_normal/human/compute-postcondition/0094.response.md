The value of `x` is 0. The code attempts to execute `ts[x - 1] += 1`, which translates to `ts[-1] += 1`. However, since `x` is not greater than the length of `ts`, we proceed with the statement. The value at `ts[-1]` is incremented by 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 0, and `ts[-1]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`x` is 0, and `ts[-1]` is incremented by 1**
