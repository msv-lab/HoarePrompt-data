Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 12 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of the next `item`, `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result based on all iterations, and `res` contains the final computed value based on the characters of the next `item` processed during the loop. If `arr[i - 1]` equals 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
