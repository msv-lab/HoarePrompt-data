Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `xs` where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) and the length of `xs` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. It returns a list `us` such that each entry in `us` represents the cumulative count of smaller distinct integers from `xs` that are to the right of each corresponding element in the original list `xs`. The function handles distinct integers and their counts effectively, but does not account for cases where all elements in `xs` are the same, which would result in all entries in `us` being zero. **
