The variable `x` is updated by performing the operation `x -= x & -x`. This operation will modify the value of `x` based on the least significant bit set in its binary representation. The previous value of `x` is `zs[i] + 1`. The exact value of `x` after the operation will depend on the specific value of `zs[i]`.

Since the initial state indicates that `us[i]` has already been updated by adding `ts[zs[i]]` and then again by adding `ts[x - 1]`, we note that those updates are not affected by this operation. 

However, the value of `x` will change, and we will have the new value of `x` after the operation. 

Output State: **`us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[zs[i]]`; `x` is updated to a new value after the operation `x -= x & -x`; `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`.**
