Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `x` is the length of `item`; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[0] * res` and `res` is updated to the final computed value based on the elements of `item` if `x` is less than or equal to `i`. Otherwise, after the loop execution, `j` is -1, `i` is unchanged, `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `x` is the length of `item`, and `ans` is updated based on `arr[i - 1] * res.***
