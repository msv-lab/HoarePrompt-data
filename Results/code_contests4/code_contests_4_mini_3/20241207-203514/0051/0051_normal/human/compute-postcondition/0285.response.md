The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value was 2, the new value of `j` will be 3. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `ans`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than 0 and now `x` is decremented by 1; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is updated based on the expression; `j` is 3.
