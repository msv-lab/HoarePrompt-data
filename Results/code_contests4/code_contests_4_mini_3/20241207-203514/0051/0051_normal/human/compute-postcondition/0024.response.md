The value of `numb` can be any integer from `zero` to `zero + 9`, and `sign` is 1. The line of code appends the result of `sign * numb` to the list `A`. Since `sign` is 1, the value being appended is simply `numb`. The list `A` was initially empty, so it will now contain the value of `numb`.

Output State: **`conv` is assigned a function based on `py2`, `A` contains `numb`, `numb` is either `zero`, `zero + 1`, `zero + 2`, ..., `zero + 9`, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 1**
