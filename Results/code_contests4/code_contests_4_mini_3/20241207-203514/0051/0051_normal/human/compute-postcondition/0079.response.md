According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement or an exit condition within the loop body. Therefore, there are no conditions that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one time. The loop will execute the first time regardless of the values of `x` or `i`.

State: **`x` is 0, `us[i]` is updated by adding the values from `ts` corresponding to the original values of `x` during each iteration until `x` becomes 0, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`**
