According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than `i`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `x` is greater than 0. Since `x` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute. As such, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one time. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than 0; `ans` is unchanged; `res` is 0; `j` is 0**
