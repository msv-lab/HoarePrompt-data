The variable `j` is assigned the value 0. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 10; `x` is undefined; `res` is 0; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 11 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 10; `x` is undefined; `res` is 0; `j` is 0**
