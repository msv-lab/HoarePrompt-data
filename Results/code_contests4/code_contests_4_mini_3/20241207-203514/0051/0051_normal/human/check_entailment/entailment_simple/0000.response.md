Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Understanding of the Function `f(x, y)`**: The problem requires a function `f(x, y)` that alternates the digits of two numbers `x` and `y`. However, the program does not explicitly define or implement this function. Instead, the code has a nested loop that seems to be attempting to calculate a sum based on the lengths of the input numbers, but it does not correctly implement the digit alternation as specified.

2. **Counting Lengths**: The program starts by counting the lengths of numbers and storing them in an array `arr`, which is not part of the required logic to calculate `f(x, y)`. This approach does not address the core requirement of the problem, which is to compute the alternating digit sum for all pairs `(a_i, a_j)`.

3. **Incorrect Logic in Nested Loops**: The nested loops do not correctly implement the alternating digit combination. They seem to be using powers of ten and manipulating digits, but the logic is convoluted and does not align with the specifications provided in the problem description.

4. **Final Accumulated Result**: The final result being printed does not correspond to the expected output as defined in the problem description. The output should be the sum of `f(a_i, a_j)` for all pairs `(i, j)` modulo `998244353`, but the implemented logic does not guarantee this.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to an incorrect implementation.
