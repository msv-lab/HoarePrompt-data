You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This problem differs from the previous one only in the absence of the constraint on the equal length of all numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.

Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers f(a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - 1} b_q), where a_1 ... a_p and b_1 ... b_q are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.

In other words, the function f(x, y) alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers x and y by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number y. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.

For example: $$$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212 f(7777, 888) = 7787878 f(33, 44444) = 4443434 f(555, 6) = 5556 f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$$

Formally,

  * if p ≥ q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q; 
  * if p < q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q. 



Mishanya gives you an array consisting of n integers a_i, your task is to help students to calculate ∑_{i = 1}^{n}∑_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j) modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of elements in the array. The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, reads `n` strings from input, and calculates a result based on the lengths of these strings and their numeric values. The result is accumulated in the variable `ans`, which is printed at the end. The specific logic involves counting how many strings have each length from 1 to 10 and performing calculations involving powers of 10 modulo 998244353 based on these counts and the numeric values of the strings. The function does not return any value, but it outputs the final accumulated result directly.

#Function 2:

    return res
    #The program returns the value of 'res' which is computed based on the initial 'x' and 'p' for all corresponding bits of 'y' that is currently 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: integers `x`, `y`, and `p`, and returns the result of calculating `(x^y) % p` using an efficient method called exponentiation by squaring. It handles large values of `y` and ensures that intermediate results remain within the modulo `p`.

    return us
    #The program returns the list 'us' containing the cumulative sums of counts from 'ts' corresponding to the indices defined by 'zs'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `xs` where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) and the length of `xs` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. It returns a list `us` such that each entry in `us` represents the cumulative count of smaller distinct integers from `xs` that are to the right of each corresponding element in the original list `xs`. The function handles distinct integers and their counts effectively, but does not account for cases where all elements in `xs` are the same, which would result in all entries in `us` being zero.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: zero is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the sum of f(a_i, a_j) for all pairs (i, j) where a_i and a_j are integers in the input array, and each a_i is within the range 1 to 10^9.

            elif s[i] != b'\r'[0]:

        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `conv` is assigned a function based on `py2`, `A` contains the integers parsed from the input `s` (excluding the negative sign and carriage return), `numb` is `zero`, `sign` is 1, and `i` is equal to the length of `s`.
    except:
        pass
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: `conv` is assigned a function based on `py2`, `A` contains the integers parsed from the input `s` (excluding the negative sign and carriage return), `numb` is `zero`, `sign` is 1, and `i` is equal to the length of `s`.
    if (s and s[-1] >= b'0'[0]) :
        A.append(sign * numb)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`conv` is a function based on `py2`, `A` contains the integers parsed from the input `s`, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, and `i` is equal to the length of `s`. If `s` is not empty and the last character of `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', then 0 is appended to `A`.
    return A
    #The program returns the list A that contains integers parsed from the input s, and if s is not empty and the last character of s is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', then 0 is appended to A.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `zero` and reads a byte string from standard input, parsing integers from it while handling negative signs and carriage returns. It constructs a list `A` of these integers, and if the last byte in the input is a numeric character, it appends the integer `0` to the list before returning it. The function does not handle cases where the input may not contain any integers, which could lead to returning an empty list.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
