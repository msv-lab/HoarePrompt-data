To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1()` and ensure it adheres to the defined requirements of the problem.

The problem is about constructing a function `f(a_i, a_j)` that alternates the digits of two numbers `a_i` and `a_j` while considering their lengths. The result should be computed for all pairs `(i, j)` in an array of integers, and the sum of these results should be returned modulo `998244353`.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Digit Alternation Logic**: The function `f(a_i, a_j)` should alternate the digits starting with `a_j`, and the alternating should continue until all digits of both numbers have been combined. If one number runs out of digits, the rest of the other number should simply be appended.

2. **Input Constraints**: The input consists of `n` integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` and each integer is between `1` and `10^9`.

3. **Output**: The result should be printed as the sum of all `f(a_i, a_j)` modulo `998244353`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program reads `n` integers and stores their lengths in an array `arr` where `arr[i]` counts how many integers have length `i+1`.
- For each integer in the input, it calculates the result of combining it with integers of different lengths based on the logic of `f(a_i, a_j)`.
- The logic for calculating the contribution of each combination is complex and involves powers of 10, which are computed with the `pow` function modulo `998244353`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly implement the logic for digit alternation as per the problem statement. Instead, it relies on counting and combining lengths, which may lead to incorrect outputs for certain combinations of numbers. For example:
  - For input `1` and `2`, the expected output of `f(1, 2)` should be `21` (i.e., `2` followed by `1`). If the program does not handle this correctly due to its reliance on counts rather than direct digit manipulation, it would produce an incorrect result.

### Example Case to Test:
Consider the case where:
```
Input:
2
1 2
```
The expected output should be `21` (from `f(1, 2) + f(2, 1) = 21 + 12 = 33`). However, if the program does not calculate this directly or mismanages the counts based on lengths, it may yield an incorrect total.

Given the complexity of the combination logic and the reliance on length counting rather than direct digit manipulation, there is a risk that it does not cover all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Due to the complexity and potential misalignment with the requirements of the digit alternation function, the program does not guarantee correct behavior for all inputs as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
