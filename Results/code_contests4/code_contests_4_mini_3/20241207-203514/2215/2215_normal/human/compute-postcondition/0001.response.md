The function `func` accepts a document identifier `id`, which is an integer constrained to the range 0 ≤ id ≤ 10^6, and a string representing the name of the document. The function also processes subsequent lines containing the text of the document, which collectively do not exceed a total size of 10 kilobytes. It is guaranteed that the document corresponds to one of the three subjects, represented by the integers 1, 2, or 3. The function's output is not explicitly provided in the prompt, but it can be inferred that it likely handles or processes the document according to the specified parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a document identifier (id) as an integer, a string for the document name, and text lines not exceeding 10 kilobytes. It processes the document corresponding to one of the three subjects (1, 2, or 3).**
