The provided program simply prints the integer '3' without processing any input or handling any documents, which is a direct violation of the problem description. The problem requires the program to read a document identifier, a document name, and the document text, and then determine which subject (1, 2, or 3) the document corresponds to. 

The output hints clarify that the function does not accept any parameters and fails to perform any necessary operations related to document handling. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which explicitly states the need to classify documents based on their content.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for any potential case and lacks any logic to handle the input as specified, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because it does not read input or process documents as required by the problem statement, and simply returns a hardcoded value which does not reflect any of the expected functionalities.
