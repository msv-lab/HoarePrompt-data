Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires the program to determine and print the subject of a given document based on the identifier, name, and content of the document. However, the function `func()` simply prints the string '3' without processing any input or determining the subject based on the provided document information. 

It does not handle the input parameters, nor does it implement any logic to differentiate between subjects 1, 2, or 3 based on the document's content, which is a fundamental requirement of the task. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description's specifications and cannot be considered correct in any case.
