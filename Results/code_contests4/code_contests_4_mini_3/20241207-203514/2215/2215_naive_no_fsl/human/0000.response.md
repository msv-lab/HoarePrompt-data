Correctness: **False**

The provided program simply prints '3' without any logic to determine the subject of the document based on its content. According to the problem description, the program should analyze the document's text to identify its subject, which is guaranteed to be either 1, 2, or 3. 

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

- Input:
```
0
Sample Document
This is a sample document text.
```

Expected output (depends on the content of the document): Should be 1, 2, or 3 based on the actual subject of the document. 

Actual output: The program will output '3' regardless of the document's content, which does not satisfy the requirement of determining the correct subject based on the document's text. Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
