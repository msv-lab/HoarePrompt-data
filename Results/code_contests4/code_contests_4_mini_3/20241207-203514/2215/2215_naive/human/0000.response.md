Correctness: **False**.

The program simply prints '3' without any logic to determine the subject of the document based on the input provided. According to the problem description, the output should be an integer from 1 to 3 that corresponds to the subject of a given document. However, since the program does not take the document identifier or any other input into account, it will always output '3', regardless of the actual document's content or identifier. This means that it does not fulfill the requirement of indicating the correct subject for the document based on its identifier or content. 

For example, if the input is:
```
1
Document Name
This is the text of the document.
```
The output should correspond to the subject of the document with identifier '1', but the program will incorrectly output '3'. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem requirements.
