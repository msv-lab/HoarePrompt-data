You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: <image>


There is a container that is bifurcated as shown in the figure. Drop 10 balls numbered from 1 to 10 through the opening A of the container and place the balls in the left cylinder B or the right cylinder C. Since plate D can rotate left and right around the fulcrum E, you can move plate D to decide whether to put it in cylinder B or cylinder C.

Gives a sequence of balls to drop from opening A. Put them in cylinder B or cylinder C in order. At this time, create a program that outputs YES if both cylinder B and cylinder C can arrange large balls on the small numbered balls, and NO if they cannot be arranged. However, the order of the balls cannot be changed in the container. In addition, it is assumed that they can be put in the same cylinder in succession, and that there is enough room for all 10 balls in both cylinders B and C.



Input

Given multiple datasets. The number of datasets N is given in the first line. Then you are given a dataset of N rows. Each dataset is given 10 numbers, starting from the left, separated by blanks.

Output

Print YES or NO on one line for each dataset.

Example

Input

2
3 1 4 2 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


Output

YES
NO
Program:
```
n = input()
data = []
for i in range(n):
    tmp = map(int, raw_input().split())
    data.append(tmp)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
