Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function uses `input()` and `raw_input()`, which is not appropriate in Python 3. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead of `raw_input()`, which doesn't exist. This will lead to a runtime error if the program is executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Data Storage**: The program stores the input data as `map` objects instead of lists. When `map(int, raw_input().split())` is executed, it creates a map object that needs to be converted to a list if we want to store it in a format that allows for further processing. This means that `data.append(tmp)` will not store the actual integers in `data`, but rather a map object, which is not useful for subsequent operations.

3. **Logic Implementation**: The program does not include any logic to determine whether the balls can be arranged according to the specified rules (i.e., whether both cylinder B and cylinder C can hold the balls in the required order). The program lacks the essential logic required to evaluate the conditions specified in the problem statement.

4. **Output Generation**: The program does not print any output (YES or NO) based on the evaluations of the arrangements of the balls, which is a crucial part of the problem. 

Due to these reasons, the program does not adhere to the specifications outlined in the problem description and therefore is deemed incorrect.
