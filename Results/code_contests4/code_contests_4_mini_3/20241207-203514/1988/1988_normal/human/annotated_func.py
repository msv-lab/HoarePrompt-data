#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple datasets; the first line contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), followed by N lines each containing exactly 10 integers (1 <= value <= 10) representing the order in which balls are dropped.
def func():
    n = input()
    data = []
    for i in range(n):
        tmp = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        data.append(tmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `data` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, and each map object corresponds to a line of input with 10 integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input N, representing the number of datasets, followed by N lines each containing exactly 10 integers. It processes this input and stores it in a list named `data`. However, it lacks a return statement, so it does not return any output or provide feedback on the processed data. Additionally, the function does not handle invalid input cases, such as when the user provides fewer or more than 10 integers per line or when N is outside the specified range.
