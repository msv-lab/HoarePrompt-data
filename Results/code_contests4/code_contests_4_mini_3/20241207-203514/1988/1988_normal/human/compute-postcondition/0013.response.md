Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input N, representing the number of datasets, followed by N lines each containing exactly 10 integers. It processes this input and stores it in a list named `data`. However, it lacks a return statement, so it does not return any output or provide feedback on the processed data. Additionally, the function does not handle invalid input cases, such as when the user provides fewer or more than 10 integers per line or when N is outside the specified range.**
