The variable `tmp` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means `raw_input()` will accept a line of input, split it into separate strings, and then `map(int, ...)` will convert each string into an integer. The exact values of the integers depend on the user input, which we do not know. However, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `tmp` holds a map object containing integers from user input.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `tmp` holds a map object containing integers from user input.**
