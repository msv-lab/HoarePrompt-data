The `append` method adds the `tmp` map object to the `data` list. Since `data` already contains the `tmp` map object, after execution, `data` will now contain two references to `tmp`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the state of `tmp` does not affect the output state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `data` now contains two references to the same `tmp` map object.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `data` now contains two references to the same `tmp` map object.**
