The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it will contain a map object of integers obtained from the input. The initial state does not affect the other variables directly, and since `n` is greater than 0, the raw input can accept multiple integers. However, the specific values of the integers inputted are not known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `tmp` is a map object of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `tmp` is a map object of integers from user input**.
