The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple datasets, where the first line contains an integer N, representing the number of subsequent lines. Each of the following N lines contains exactly 10 integers, each integer representing the order in which balls are dropped. After executing the function body, it produces an output based on the provided datasets.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets with the first line indicating the number of datasets, followed by N lines each containing 10 integers, representing the order of dropped balls.**
