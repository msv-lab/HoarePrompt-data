The code appends the `tmp` map object to the `data` list. Since `tmp` is holding a map object containing integers from user input, the `data` list will now include this map object. The previous values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and only the `data` list is affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `data` now includes the `tmp` map object.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `data` now includes the `tmp` map object.**
