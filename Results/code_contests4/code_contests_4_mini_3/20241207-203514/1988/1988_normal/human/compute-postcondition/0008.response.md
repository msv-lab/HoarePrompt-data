According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and since `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `tmp` is a map object of integers from user input, and `data` now contains the `tmp` map object appended to it.**
