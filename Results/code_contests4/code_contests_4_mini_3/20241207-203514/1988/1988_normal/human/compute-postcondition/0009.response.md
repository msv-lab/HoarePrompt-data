The code assigns the `tmp` variable to a new map object that converts a split string input into integers. The `raw_input()` function captures user input, and `map(int, ...)` applies the `int` function to each element of the split string, resulting in a map object of integers. This does not affect the values of `n` and `i`, but it creates a new map object of integers in `tmp`. The `data` variable contains this new `tmp` map object. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `tmp` is a map object of integers from user input, and `data` now contains the `tmp` map object.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `tmp` is a map object of integers from user input, and `data` now contains the `tmp` map object.**
