To determine the output state, we analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the initial state of the variables.

1. The code `c += int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))` updates the value of `c`.
2. The variable `h` is initially 0, and we have `H` which is not defined in the initial state but can be assumed to be a positive integer greater than or equal to `h` for the calculation to be valid.
3. The variable `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, which is greater than `b` (the first element of list `B`).
4. The operation `(H - h) * 1.0` results in a float value, and dividing by `am` gives the final value before the ceiling operation is applied.
5. The `ceil` function rounds the result up to the nearest integer, and `int` casts it to an integer.
6. Finally, `c` is incremented by this integer value.

Since we don't have specific values for `H`, `am`, or the resulting computation, we acknowledge that the variables `h` and `am` remain unchanged, and `c` is increased by an integer based on the calculation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is increased by an integer value based on the calculation; `bi` is 0; `b` is the first element of list `B` and is less than `am`.**
