According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
