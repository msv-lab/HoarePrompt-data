According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and the constant `H`. The loop will continue executing as long as `h` is less than `H`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is less than `H`, so the loop can execute again.

There are no other states that need to be adjusted since the condition for the loop to execute again is already satisfied.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is less than `H`**.
