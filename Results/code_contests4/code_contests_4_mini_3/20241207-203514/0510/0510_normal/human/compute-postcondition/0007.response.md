According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `i` can be incremented. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
