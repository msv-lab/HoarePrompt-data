The code `B.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the list `B`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, and we have no prior information about the list `B` or the value of `b`. Therefore, the output state remains unaffected by the code in terms of other variable values, but it indicates that a value has been added to `B`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `i` is 0; `A` is the list containing `a`; the value `b` has been appended to the list `B`.**
