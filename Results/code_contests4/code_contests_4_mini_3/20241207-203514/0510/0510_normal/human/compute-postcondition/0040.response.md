Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is less than `H`; if `b < am`, then `c` is increased by the value of `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `h` is increased by `b`, `c` is increased by 1, and `bi` is increased by 1.***
