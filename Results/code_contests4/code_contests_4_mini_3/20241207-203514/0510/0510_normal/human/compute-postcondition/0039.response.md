The value of `bi` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `bi` is unknown, but it does not affect the values of other variables directly. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A; `h` is less than `H`; `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]; `h` is increased by `b`; variable `c` is increased by 1 and `bi` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A; `h` is less than `H`; `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]; `h` is increased by `b`; variable `c` is increased by 1; `bi` is increased by 1.**
