According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and the variable `H`. If `h` is less than `H`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `h` is 0. For the loop to execute at least once, `H` must be greater than `h`. Since `h` is 0, it requires that `H` should be at least 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `N`, `A`, `B`, `am`, and `c` do not affect the condition for the loop to run.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time then `H` must be greater than 0**
