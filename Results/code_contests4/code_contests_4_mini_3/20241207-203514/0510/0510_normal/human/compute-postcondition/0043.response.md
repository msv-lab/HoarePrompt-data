To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the code step-by-step considering the initial state.

1. The variable `c` is incremented by the result of the expression `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`.
2. The value of `H` is not defined in the initial state but we know `h` is less than `H`.
3. The variable `am` is defined as the maximum value in list `A`, which is a positive integer.
4. The expression `(H - h)` evaluates to a positive value since `h` is less than `H`.
5. By dividing this positive value by `am`, we get another positive value, which is then multiplied by `1.0` to ensure floating-point division.
6. The `ceil` function rounds this result up to the nearest integer.
7. Finally, `int()` converts the result of `ceil` to an integer, and this integer is added to the existing value of `c`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `c`, `H`, `h`, and `am`, we cannot compute the exact numeric result of the expression. However, we can state that `c` is increased by some positive integer value derived from the expression.

Output State: **`c` is increased by a positive integer derived from the expression `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`**.
