Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; if `b` is less than `am`, then `c` is increased by a positive integer derived from the expression `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))` and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `h + b`, `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`, `c` is increased by 1, and `bi` is incremented by 1.***
