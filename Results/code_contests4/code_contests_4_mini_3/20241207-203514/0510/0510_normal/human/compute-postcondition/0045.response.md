The code `h += b` increments the value of `h` by the value of `b`. Since `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`, the exact value of `b` depends on the contents of list `B` at index `bi`. The previous value of `h` is unknown, but it is stated that `h` is less than `H`. Therefore, after executing the code, `h` increases by the value of `b`, but we cannot determine the exact new value of `h`.

The output state reflects that `h` has been updated based on the value of `b`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is now h + b; `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is now h + b; `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`.**
