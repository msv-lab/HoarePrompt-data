Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; if `b` (the first element of list `B`) is less than `am`, then `c` is increased by an integer value based on the calculation, `bi` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `h + b`, `c` is set to 1, and `bi` is set to 1, indicating that `b` is greater than or equal to `am`.***
