The code snippet uses `raw_input()` to accept two integer inputs from the user and then splits them into two variables, `a` and `b`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts the input strings from `raw_input()` into integers. The previous values of `N` and `i` remain unaffected, as they are not involved in this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the two input integers from raw_input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the two input integers from raw_input.**
