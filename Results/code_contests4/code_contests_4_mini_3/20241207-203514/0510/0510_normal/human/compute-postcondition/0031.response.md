The value of `bi` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `bi` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `bi` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is `h + b`, where `b` is the first element of list `B`, and the value of `b` is greater than or equal to `am`; `c` is 1; `bi` is 1.**
