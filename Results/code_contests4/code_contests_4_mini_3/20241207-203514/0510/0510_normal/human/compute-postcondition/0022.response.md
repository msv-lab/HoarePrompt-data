The variable `bi` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect any other variables since `bi` is not previously defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same for other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0.**
