To analyze the provided code snippet:

1. `c` is incremented by the value of `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`.
2. The variables `H` and `h` are involved in the calculation, with `H` being some constant (not defined in the initial state) and `h` being less than `H`.
3. `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, which is a positive integer and will be greater than 0.
4. The calculation `(H - h) * 1.0` ensures that the division will yield a floating-point result.
5. The result of the division is passed to `ceil()`, which rounds up any fractional value to the nearest integer.
6. Finally, this integer value is converted to an integer (though it is already an integer after `ceil`).

The output state will depend on the specific values of `H`, `h`, and `am`, which are not provided in the initial state. Thus, the specific change to `c` cannot be determined.

Given that, the relevant output reflecting the changes made is:

Output State: **`c` is increased by the value of `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))` where `H` is some constant, `h` is less than `H`, and `am` is the maximum value in list `A`.**
