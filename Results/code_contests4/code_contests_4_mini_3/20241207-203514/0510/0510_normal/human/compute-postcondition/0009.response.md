The code `A.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `A`. The variable `a` is an input integer, and its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `A` will now contain the value of `a` added to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `i` is 1, `A` now contains the input integer `a`**
