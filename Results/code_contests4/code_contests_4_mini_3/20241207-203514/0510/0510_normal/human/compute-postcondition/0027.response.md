The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a list of `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is increased by an integer value based on the calculation; `bi` is 0; `b` is the first element of list `B` and is less than `am`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
