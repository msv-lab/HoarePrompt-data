To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to compute the minimum number of attacks required to inflict at least `H` points of damage to a monster using `N` katanas, each with two types of damage: wielding (`a_i`) and throwing (`b_i`). 

### Program Analysis:
1. The program first reads the values of `N` and `H`, followed by reading the pairs `(a_i, b_i)` into lists `A` and `B`.
2. It finds the maximum value from list `A` and sorts list `B` in descending order.
3. It then attempts to inflict damage using the values in `B` until the total damage `h` reaches or exceeds `H`. If the maximum value from `A` is greater than the maximum value in `B`, it calculates how many additional attacks using `A` would be needed to reach `H`.

### Possible Edge Cases:
- If all values of `b_i` are less than `a_i`, the program should still function correctly since it will recognize that it can only use the wielding attacks to inflict damage.
- If `H` is 0, the output should be 0 since no attacks are needed.
- The program might not handle cases where `H` is very large compared to the sum of all `b_i` values effectively, particularly when `N` is large.
  
### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function computes the number of times it can add values from `B` to reach or exceed `H`. If the maximum value from `A` is greater than the largest value in `B`, it calculates the additional number of attacks needed using the maximum value from `A`.

### Verification Against Output Hints:
The output hints seem to align with the code's logic. The program checks whether the maximum value from `A` can be used effectively when the values from `B` are not sufficient to reach `H`. 

### Conclusion:
Despite the output hints being consistent with the code's logic, potential edge cases such as the scenario where `H` is significantly larger than the sum of all `b_i` values could lead to incorrect results. The code may not correctly handle the situation where the total damage required exceeds the combined potential of all katanas when only using the throwing mechanism.

Thus, there is a possibility that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. 

Correctness: **False**.
