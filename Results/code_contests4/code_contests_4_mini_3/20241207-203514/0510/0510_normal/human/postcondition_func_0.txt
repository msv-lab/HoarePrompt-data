The function accepts no parameters but reads input values for `N` (the number of pairs) and `H` (a target integer). It then reads `N` pairs of integers `(a_i, b_i)` and computes how many times it can add values from the list `B` (sorted in descending order) to reach or exceed the value `H`. If the maximum value of `A` is greater than the largest value in `B`, the function calculates how many additional times it would need to add the maximum value of `A` to exceed `H`. The function ultimately prints the total count of additions required. It handles situations where `H` could be reached either by using values from `B` or by calculating based on the maximum value from `A`.
