The values of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged. If `val` is None, -1 is printed, indicating that the goal is not reachable. Otherwise, if `val` is assigned a value from `seen[goal]` that is not None, `pnum` reflects the minimum number of steps taken to reach the goal if reachable, or the number of steps taken to explore reachable positions, and `val` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the dimensions of a grid and two sets of coordinates representing start and goal positions on the grid. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position, moving through valid road cells ('.') while avoiding walls ('#'). If the goal is reachable, it prints the minimum number of steps; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not take parameters directly but relies on input provided via standard input.
