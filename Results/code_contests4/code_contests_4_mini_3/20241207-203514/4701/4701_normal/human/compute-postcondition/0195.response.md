Postcondition: ***`ux`, `uy`, `xx`, `yy`, `vv`, `x`, `y`, `u`, and `num` are calculated based on the values of `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `pnum`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` equals '#', the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.***
