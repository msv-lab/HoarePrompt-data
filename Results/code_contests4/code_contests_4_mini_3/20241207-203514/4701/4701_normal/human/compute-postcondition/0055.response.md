The value `1` is appended to the list `vvs`, but the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is updated with the value of `i`; `dy` has a new value appended for each `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2; `vvs` is now updated to include `1`.
