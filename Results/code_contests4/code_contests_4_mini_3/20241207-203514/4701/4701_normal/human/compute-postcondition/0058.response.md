Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; if `i` is not equal to `j` which is not equal to 0, then `dx` is updated with the value of `i`, `dy` has a new value appended for each `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2; if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then `vvs` is updated to include `1`; otherwise, `vvs` has one additional element, which is `0`. If `i` is equal to `j` and both are equal to 0, no changes are made to `dx`, `dy`, or `vvs`.***
