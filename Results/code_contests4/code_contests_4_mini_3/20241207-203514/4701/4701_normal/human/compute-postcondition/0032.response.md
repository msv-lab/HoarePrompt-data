The code initializes `dy` as an empty list. Since `dy` was not assigned any previous values, it simply becomes an empty list now. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is an empty list; `dy` is an empty list.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is an empty list; `dy` is an empty list.**
