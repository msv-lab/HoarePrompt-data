The value of `j` is appended to the list `dy`. Since `j` is currently -2, `dy` will now contain the value -2. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` now contains `i`; `dy` is now [-2]; `vvs` is an empty list; for the loop to execute the first time `j` is -2; `i` is not equal to `0`, and `j` is not equal to `0`.
