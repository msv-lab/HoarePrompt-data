The code `dy.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `dy`. Since the previous value of `dy` is `[-2]`, after executing this line, the list `dy` will include the value of `j`, which can range from -2 to 2 based on the completed loop. However, since we don't know the exact value of `j` at this state, we can only denote that `j` has been appended to `dy`.

The output state remains unchanged for the other variables. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the previous values plus `i`; `dy` is now `[-2, j]`; `vvs` is updated to [1] or [0] based on the condition; the loop has completed executing for all values of `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2.**
