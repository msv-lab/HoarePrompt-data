The code `dx.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `dx`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `dx` is a list that will now contain one additional element (the value of `i`). Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. However, we can state that the list `dx` will have one more element after the execution. Therefore, the output state is: `dx` has one more element which is the value of `i`.

Output State: **`dx` has one more element which is the value of `i`**
