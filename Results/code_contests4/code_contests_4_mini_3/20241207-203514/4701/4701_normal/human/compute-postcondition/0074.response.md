The variable `vvs` is a list that is being appended with the value `1`. The previous values of `vvs` are not specified, but the operation will add `1` to the list. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is now `dx` with the value of `i` appended; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 1, 2, -2, 2]`; `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`; after the last iteration, `j` is 2; `i` is appended to `dx`; `vvs` now contains the previous values plus `1`.
