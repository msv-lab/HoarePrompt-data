Postcondition: ***`ux` retains its initial value, `uy` retains its initial value, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` contain at least 2 elements each; `xx` is the second element of `dx`, `yy` is the second element of `dy`, `vv` is the second element of `vvs`; `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. If `x` is negative, `y` is negative, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', the loop continues to the next iteration.***
