Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the previous values plus `i`; `dy` is now `[-2, j]`; if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` is appended with `1`. Otherwise, `vvs` is updated to either [1, 0] or [0, 0]. The loop has completed executing for all values of `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2.***
