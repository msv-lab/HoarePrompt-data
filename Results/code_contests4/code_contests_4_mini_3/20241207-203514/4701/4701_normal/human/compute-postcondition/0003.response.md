The variables `h` and `w` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which splits a string of input into separate components. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these components into integers. Since `H` and `W` are defined as integers in the initial state with the constraints 1 <= `H`, `W` <= 1000, we can infer that `h` and `w` will also take values within this range. However, since the specific input values are not provided, we denote them as the integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000**
