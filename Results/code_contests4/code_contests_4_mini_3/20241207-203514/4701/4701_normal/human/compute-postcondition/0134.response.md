The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux` and `uy` are assigned values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` each contain at least 2 elements; `xx` is the second element of `dx`; `yy` is the second element of `dy`; `vv` is the second element of `vvs`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
