Output State: **`seen[u]` is updated to the minimum `num` encountered for each unique `u`, where `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`. If `u` was previously None or had a greater associated `num`, it is set to `num`. If the loop does not execute, `seen[u]` remains unchanged. `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `pnum` are unchanged.**
