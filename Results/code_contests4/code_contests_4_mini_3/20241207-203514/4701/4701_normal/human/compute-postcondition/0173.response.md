Postcondition: ***`ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` retain their initial values; `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` are the second elements of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` respectively; `x` is the sum of `ux` and `xx`, and `y` is the sum of `uy` and `yy`. `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is updated to `num`, and the function `hp` is called with parameters `(num, u)`. Otherwise, `seen[u]` remains unchanged.***
