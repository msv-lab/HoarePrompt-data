The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and execution proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, `yy`, `vv`, `vvs`, `dx`, `dy` are calculated based on the values of `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `pnum`; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, and `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
