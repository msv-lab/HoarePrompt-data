The variable `q` is assigned a list containing a tuple with the first element as `0` and the second element as `start`. The value of `start` is derived from `ch * w + cw`, but since `ch`, `w`, and `cw` are not specified in this context, `start` remains as a variable. The other variables (`h`, `ss`, `n`, `goal`, and `seen`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]**.
