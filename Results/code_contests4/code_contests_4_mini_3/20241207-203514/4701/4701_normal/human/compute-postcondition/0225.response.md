Postcondition: ***`q` is empty, `seen` contains updated minimum values for each valid `u`, and `ux` and `uy` are the coordinates derived from the final position `pu`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged. If `val` is None, -1 is printed, indicating that the goal is not reachable. Otherwise, if `val` is assigned a value from `seen[goal]` that is not None, `pnum` reflects the minimum number of steps taken to reach the goal if reachable, or the number of steps taken to explore reachable positions, and `val` is printed.***
