The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. The previous values of `dx` are not specified, but `i` is added to it. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `dx`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` has added `i`, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`, `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j` with a total of 5 entries reflecting the conditions checked in the loop, and `i` and `j` are not both equal to 0.**
