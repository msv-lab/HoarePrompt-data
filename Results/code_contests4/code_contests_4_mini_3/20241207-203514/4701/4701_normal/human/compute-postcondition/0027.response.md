The value of `goal` is assigned the expression `dh * w + dw`. The values of the variables `dh`, `w`, and `dw` are not provided in the initial state, so they are unknown. The output state includes the known variables and indicates the assignment of `goal`. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols` but cannot be determined without knowing `rows` and `cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw; goal is assigned the value of dh * w + dw, where dh, w, and dw are unknown.
