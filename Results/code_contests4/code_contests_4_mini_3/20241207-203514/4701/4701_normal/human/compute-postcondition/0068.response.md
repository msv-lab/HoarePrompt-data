The variable `vvs` is a list that has been assigned values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`. The code `vvs.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `vvs`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is now `dx` with the value of `i` appended; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 1, 2, -2]`; `vvs` contains the previous values and now has `0` appended.
