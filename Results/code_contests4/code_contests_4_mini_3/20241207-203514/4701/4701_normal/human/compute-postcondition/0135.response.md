Postcondition: ***`ux` and `uy` are assigned values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` each contain at least 2 elements; `xx` is the second element of `dx`; `yy` is the second element of `dy`; `vv` is the second element of `vvs`; `x` is calculated as `ux + xx`; `y` is calculated as `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `x < 0` or `y < 0` or `x >= h` or `y >= w` or `ss[x][y] == '#'`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds normally.***
