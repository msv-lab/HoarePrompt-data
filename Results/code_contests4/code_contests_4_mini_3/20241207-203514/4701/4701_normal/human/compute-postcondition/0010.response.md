The values of `rows` and `cols` are assigned the values of `h` and `w`, respectively. The variables `h` and `w` retain their input integer values within the specified range, while `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, and `dw` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `rows` is `h`; `cols` is `w`; `ch` is an input integer decreased by 1; `cw` is the original input integer decreased by 1; `dh` is decreased by 1; `dw` is the original input integer decreased by 2.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `rows` is `h`; `cols` is `w`; `ch` is an input integer decreased by 1; `cw` is the original input integer decreased by 1; `dh` is decreased by 1; `dw` is the original input integer decreased by 2.**
