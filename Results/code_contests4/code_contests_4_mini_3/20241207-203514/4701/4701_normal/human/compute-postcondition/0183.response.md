Output State: **`ux` and `uy` retain their initial values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` contain at least the same number of elements as the length of `seen`; `seen[u]` is updated to the minimum `num` where applicable throughout all iterations; if `seen[u]` is not None and less than or equal to `num`, it remains unchanged; the loop has evaluated all elements of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`; `q` may contain updated elements based on the calls to `hp` for each valid `(num, u)` pair.**
