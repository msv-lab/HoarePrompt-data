The code `vvs.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `vvs`. The initial state mentions that `dx` has one more element which is the value of `i`, and `dy` includes the value of `j` appended to it, but these variables are not affected by the execution of the provided code. Therefore, we can conclude that the state of `dx` and `dy` remains unchanged, while `vvs` now has an additional element `0`.

Output State: **`dx` has one more element which is the value of `i`; `dy` now includes the value of `j` appended to it; `vvs` has an additional element `0`.**
