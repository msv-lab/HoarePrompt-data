Postcondition: ***`ux` and `uy` are assigned values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` each contain at least 2 elements; `xx` is the second element of `dx`; `yy` is the second element of `dy`; `vv` is the second element of `vvs`; `x` is calculated as `ux + xx`; `y` is calculated as `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with parameters `(num, u)`. If none of these conditions are met, `seen[u]` remains unchanged.***
