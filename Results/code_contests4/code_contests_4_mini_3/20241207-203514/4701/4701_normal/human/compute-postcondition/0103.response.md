Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], and `j` is -2. If `i` is not equal to `j` and both are not equal to 0, then `i` has been appended to the list `dx`, `dy` now includes -2, and `vvs` is updated to include `1` if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1; otherwise, `vvs` is updated to include `0`.***
