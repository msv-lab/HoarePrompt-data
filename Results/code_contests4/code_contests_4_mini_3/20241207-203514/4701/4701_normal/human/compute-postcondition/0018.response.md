According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `rows`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `rows`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `rows` is equal to `h`, which is an integer within the range 1 to 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `rows` must be greater than 1.

State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `rows` is `h`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `rows` must be greater than 1**
