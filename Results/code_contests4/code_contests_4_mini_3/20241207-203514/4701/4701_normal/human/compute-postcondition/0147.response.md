Postcondition: ***`ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, and `num` are defined as per the precondition. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is updated to `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and `(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and less than or equal to `num`, no changes are made to `seen[u]`.***
