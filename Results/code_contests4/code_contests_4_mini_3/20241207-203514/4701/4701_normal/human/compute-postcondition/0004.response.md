The code assigns values to `ch` and `cw` by mapping the input values (split by space) to integers. The previous values of `h` and `w` are unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, after execution, `ch` will hold the first input integer, and `cw` will hold the second input integer. Since both inputs are integers, we can state their relationship to the input.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ch` is the first input integer; `cw` is the second input integer.**
