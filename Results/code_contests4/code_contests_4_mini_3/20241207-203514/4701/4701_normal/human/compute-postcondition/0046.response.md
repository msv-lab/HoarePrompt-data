The code `dx.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `dx`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `i` has been added to the list `dx`. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the previous values plus `i`; `dy` is now [-2]; `vvs` is updated to [1] or [0] based on the condition; the loop has completed executing for all values of `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2.**
