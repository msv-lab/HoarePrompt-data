The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on the following constraints: `H` and `W` are integers representing the height and width of a 2D grid, where both must be between 1 and 1000. The coordinates `(C_h, C_w)` and `(D_h, D_w)` represent specific points in the grid, with `C_h` and `C_w` being within the bounds of `H` and `W`, and `D_h` and `D_w` satisfying the same constraints. The 2D list `S` consists of characters that can either be a wall (`#`) or a road (`.`), with the specified coordinates both being roads (`.`) and not equal to each other. 

The function processes this data and returns a result based on the relationships and constraints provided. However, the exact return value is not specified in the output description.

Functionality: **The function operates on a grid defined by integers H and W, and coordinates C_h, C_w and D_h, D_w, which point to road locations in a 2D list S consisting of walls and roads, but does not take parameters directly and the return value is not clearly defined in the output.**
