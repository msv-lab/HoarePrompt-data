Postcondition: ***`ux` and `uy` are assigned values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` each contain at least 3 elements; `xx` is the third element of `dx`; `yy` is the third element of `dy`; `vv` is the third element of `vvs`; `x` is equal to `ux + xx`; `y` is equal to `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', we continue to the next iteration of the loop without altering any variables.***
