Postcondition: ***`seen[u]` is either updated to `num` if it was previously None or greater than `num`, or remains unchanged. The variables `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` will take on the next values from `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` respectively, while `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.***
