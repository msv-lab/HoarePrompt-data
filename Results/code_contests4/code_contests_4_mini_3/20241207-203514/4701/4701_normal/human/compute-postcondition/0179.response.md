Postcondition: ***`ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` retain their initial values; if `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, continuing to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program does not change the state.***
