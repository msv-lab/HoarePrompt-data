`cw` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cw` is an input integer, so after execution, `cw` will be one less than its original value. The other variables `h`, `w`, `ch`, `dh`, and `dw` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ch` is an input integer decreased by 1; `cw` is the original input integer decreased by 1; `dh` and `dw` are assigned new input integers.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ch` is an input integer decreased by 1; `cw` is the original input integer decreased by 1; `dh` and `dw` are assigned new input integers.**
