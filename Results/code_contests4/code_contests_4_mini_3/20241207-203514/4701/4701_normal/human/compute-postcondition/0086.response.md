According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates through the range from -2 to 2. In Python, the `range(-2, 3)` generates the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` will have taken the value -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. The loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than 2. 

If `i` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, the loop will not execute again as it has reached the upper limit of the range. If `i` was 1, it will become 2 for the next iteration, and that will still be the last iteration. If `i` was 0, it will become 1 for the next iteration, and if `i` was -1, it will become 0 for the next iteration.

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the values of `i` must be adjusted accordingly. 

State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the values of `i` repeated for each valid `j` that has been appended; `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`; `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j` with a total of 5 entries reflecting the conditions checked in the loop, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 2.**
