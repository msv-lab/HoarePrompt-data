The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux` retains its initial value, `uy` retains its initial value, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` contain at least 2 elements each; `xx` is the second element of `dx`, `yy` is the second element of `dy`, `vv` is the second element of `vvs`; `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
