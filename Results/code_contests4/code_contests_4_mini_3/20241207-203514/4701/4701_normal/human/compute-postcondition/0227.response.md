Functionality: ** The function reads the dimensions of a grid and two sets of coordinates representing start and goal positions on the grid. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position, moving through valid road cells ('.') while avoiding walls ('#'). If the goal is reachable, it prints the minimum number of steps; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not take parameters directly but relies on input provided via standard input. **
