Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the values [-2, -1, 1, 2] repeated for each valid `j`, `dy` contains the values [-2, -1, 1, 2] for the corresponding `i` values, and `vvs` contains five entries: four entries of value 1 for cases where `abs(i) + abs(j) > 1` and one entry of value 0 for the case where `abs(i) + abs(j) = 1`.**
