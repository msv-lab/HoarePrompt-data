Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains `i` repeated for each valid `j` that has been appended, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`, and `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`, with a total of 5 entries reflecting the conditions checked in the loop, with 4 entries of value 1 and 1 entry of value 0, depending on the values of `i` and `j` used in the loop iterations.**
