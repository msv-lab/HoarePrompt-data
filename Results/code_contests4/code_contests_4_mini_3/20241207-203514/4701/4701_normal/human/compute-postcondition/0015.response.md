According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rows`. The loop will execute as long as `rows` is a positive integer. Given that `h` is defined as `rows`, it is already known to be within the range of 1 to 1000, so it is guaranteed to be at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined but will start at 0 for the first iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be initialized to 0. 

State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `rows` is `h`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
