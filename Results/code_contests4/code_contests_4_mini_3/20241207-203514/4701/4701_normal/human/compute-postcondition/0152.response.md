Output State: **`ux` and `uy` retain their initial values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` contain at least the same number of elements as the length of `seen`; `seen[u]` is updated to the minimum `num` where applicable; `seen[u]` remains unchanged if it is not None and less than or equal to `num`; the loop will execute again if `q` is not empty or evaluates to True; the values of `pnum` and `pu` are assigned based on the return of `hpp(q)`; `ux` and `uy` are assigned values based on the result of `divmod(pu, w)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
