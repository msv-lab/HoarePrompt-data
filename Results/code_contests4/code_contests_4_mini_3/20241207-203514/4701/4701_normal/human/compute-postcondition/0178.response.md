The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` retain their initial values; `xx` is the third element of `dx`, `yy` is the third element of `dy`, `vv` is the third element of `vvs`, `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
