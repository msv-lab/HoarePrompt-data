The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. The previous values of `dx` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` now contains its previous values plus `i`; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 1, 2, -2, 2]`; `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`; if `i` and `j` are not both zero, depending on the condition of `abs(i) + abs(j)`, if it is greater than 1, `vvs` now contains the previous values plus `1`; if it is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` has the value 0 appended to it; for the loop to execute again, `j` must be greater than 2, which is not possible within the given range; `i` is appended to `dx`.
