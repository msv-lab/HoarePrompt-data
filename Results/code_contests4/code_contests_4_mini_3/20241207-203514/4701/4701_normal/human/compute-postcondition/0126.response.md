Postcondition: ***`ux` and `uy` are assigned values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` each contain at least 1 element; `xx` is the first element of `dx`; `yy` is the first element of `dy`; `vv` is the first element of `vvs`; `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`; `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`; `seen[u]` is either None or greater than `num`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or the element at `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', the program continues to the next iteration without further actions.***
