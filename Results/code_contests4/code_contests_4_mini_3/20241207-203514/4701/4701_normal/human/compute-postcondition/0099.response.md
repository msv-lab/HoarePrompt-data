The variable `dy` has a value that is a list. The code `dy.append(j)` takes the current value of `j`, which is `-2`, and appends it to the list `dy`. The previous values of `dy` are not specified, but now it will contain an additional element, `-2`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `j` is -2, `i` has been appended to the list `dx`, and `dy` now includes -2.**
