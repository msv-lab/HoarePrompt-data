Postcondition: ***`ux` and `uy` are assigned values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` each contain at least 1 element; `xx` is the first element of `dx`; `yy` is the first element of `dy`; `vv` is the first element of `vvs`; `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`; `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`, and `hp` is called with arguments `q` and the tuple `(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and is less than or equal to `num`, then no changes are made to `seen[u]` or any other variables.***
