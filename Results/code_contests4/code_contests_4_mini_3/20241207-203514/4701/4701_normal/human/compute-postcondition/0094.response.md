The code appends the value `0` to the list `vvs`. Since `vvs` already contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`, the length of `vvs` will increase by one, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `vvs` has one additional entry.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` has added `i`, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 1, 2, j]`, `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j` with a total of 5 entries reflecting the conditions checked in the loop, and at least one of `i` or `j` must be equal to 0, ensuring that `abs(i) + abs(j)` is less than or equal to 1; `vvs` now has one additional entry with value 0.**
