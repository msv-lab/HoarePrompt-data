The code appends the value of `i` to the list `dx`. The initial state mentions that `dx` is a list, but its previous value is not given. However, the values of other variables are not affected by this action. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `j` is reset to -2, and `i` has been appended to the list `dx`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `j` is reset to -2, and `i` has been appended to the list `dx`.**
