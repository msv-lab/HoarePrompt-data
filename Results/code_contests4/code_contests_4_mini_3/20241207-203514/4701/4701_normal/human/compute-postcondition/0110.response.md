Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], and `j` is -1. If `i` is not equal to `j` and both are not zero, then `dx` has one more element which is the value of `i`, `dy` includes the value of `j` appended to it, and if `abs(i) + abs(j) > 1`, then `vvs` has one more element which is 1; otherwise, `vvs` has an additional element which is 0.***
