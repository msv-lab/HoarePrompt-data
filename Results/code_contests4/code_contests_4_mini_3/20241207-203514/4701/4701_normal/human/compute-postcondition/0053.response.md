The value of `dx` is appended with the current value of `i`, but the previous value of `dx` is unknown. The other variables (`h`, `ss`, `n`, `start`, `goal`, `seen`, `q`, `dy`, `vvs`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is updated with the value of `i`, and `dy` remains unchanged; `vvs` remains unchanged; the loop has completed executing for all values of `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2.
