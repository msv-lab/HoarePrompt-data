According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it will execute for `j` values of -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. Since it is stated that for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 2, we can infer that the first execution of the loop has already occurred with `j` being -2 during the first iteration (as `j` starts at -2). 

For the loop to execute a second time, it must be in the range where `j` can take the next value. After the first iteration, `j` will be -1 on the second execution. 

Thus, we can summarize the necessary states as follows:
- The variable `j` is currently set to -1 in preparation for the second iteration.
- The other state variables (`h`, `ss`, `n`, `start`, `goal`, `seen`, `q`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the values of `i` repeated for each valid `j` that has been appended, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`, `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j` with a total of 5 entries reflecting the conditions checked in the loop, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is -1**
