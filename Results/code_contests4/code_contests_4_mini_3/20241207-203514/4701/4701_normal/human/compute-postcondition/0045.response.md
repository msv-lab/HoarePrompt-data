According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which will iterate through the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken on a value within this range. The loop is set to execute again if there are remaining values in the range for `j`.

Given the range `(-2, 3)`, the possible values for `j` are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, making a total of 5 iterations. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `j` would be equal to 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented to 3, which is outside the loop's range. 

Since the loop has completed all its iterations, it cannot execute again. 

The states do not need to be adjusted for a further execution of the loop since it has already iterated through all possible values of `j`.

State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` now contains `i`; `dy` is now [-2]; `vvs` is updated to [1] if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, otherwise, `vvs` is updated to [0] and the absolute values of `i` and `j` sum to 1 or less (i.e., `abs(i) + abs(j) <= 1`). The loop has completed executing for all values of `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2.**
