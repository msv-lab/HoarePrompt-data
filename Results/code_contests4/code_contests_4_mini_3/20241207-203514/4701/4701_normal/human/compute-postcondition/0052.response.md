According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `j` from -2 to 2, which includes the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. Since the loop has completed executing for all values of `j`, it has already taken on each of these values exactly once. 

After the last iteration, `j` would have the value 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to take on a value of 3, which is not included in the current range. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more values in the specified range for `j`.

State: **`h` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; if `i` is not equal to `j` which is not equal to 0, `dx` contains the previous values plus `i`, `dy` is updated to `[-2, j]`, and if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` is appended with `1`; otherwise, `vvs` is updated to either [1, 0] or [0, 0]. The loop has completed executing for all values of `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2, thus cannot execute again.**
