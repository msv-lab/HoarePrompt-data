According to the code, the loop will execute for the values of `j` in the range from -2 to 2, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. 

The next value of `j` will be -1, and since -1 is within the specified range, the loop can execute again. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will have `j` updated to -1.

State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings, `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], and `j` is -1.**
