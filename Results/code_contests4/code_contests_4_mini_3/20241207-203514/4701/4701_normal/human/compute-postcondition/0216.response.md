The function `hp` is called with the arguments `(num, u)`, which means the values of `num` and `u` are passed to this function. However, the state of `seen[u]` is already updated to `num`, and no other variables are affected. The output state reflects the change made to `seen[u]`.

Output State: **`seen[u]` is updated to `num`; other variables remain unchanged.**
