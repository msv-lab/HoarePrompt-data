According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `rows`. If `i` is less than `rows`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `rows` is `h`, which is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000, `rows` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `rows` must be greater than 2.

State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `rows` is `h`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `rows` must be greater than 1**
