The variable `vvs` is assigned an empty list, which does not affect any of the previously defined variables. Therefore, the Output State reflects the initialization of `vvs` while retaining the current values of the other variables.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is an empty list; `dy` is an empty list; `vvs` is an empty list.**
