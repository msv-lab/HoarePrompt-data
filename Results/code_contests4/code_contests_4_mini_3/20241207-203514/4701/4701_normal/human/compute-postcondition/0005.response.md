The code assigns the values from `input().split()` to the variables `dh` and `dw`, converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `h` and `w` remain unchanged, while `dh` and `dw` will now hold the values of the new integers input by the user. Therefore, the output state reflects these updates.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ch` is the first input integer; `cw` is the second input integer; `dh` and `dw` are assigned new input integers.**
