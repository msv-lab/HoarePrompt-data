Postcondition: ***`seen[u]` is either updated to `num` or remains unchanged; `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` will take on the next values from `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` equals '#', then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
