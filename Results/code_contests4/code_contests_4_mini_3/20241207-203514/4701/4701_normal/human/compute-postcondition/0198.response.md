The function `hp` is called with the arguments `(num, u)`, where `num` is a value calculated based on other variables and `u` is also a calculated value. The previous values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, `yy`, `vv`, `x`, `y`, and `seen[u]` are not directly affected by this function call as the state of these variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, `yy`, `vv`, `x`, `y`, `u`, and `num` are calculated based on the values of `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `pnum`; `seen[u]` is now assigned the value of `num`, and we call `hp(q, (num, u))`.

Output State: **`ux`, `uy`, `xx`, `yy`, `vv`, `x`, `y`, `u`, and `num` are calculated based on the values of `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `pnum`; `seen[u]` is now assigned the value of `num`, and we call `hp(q, (num, u))`.**
