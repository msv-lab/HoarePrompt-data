According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2, inclusive. The loop variable `i` starts at -2 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, which is outside the specified range of -2 to 2. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more valid values for `i` within the given range.

State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains `i` repeated for each valid `j`, `dy` is `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`, and `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`; for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 2, but it cannot, thus the loop terminates.**
