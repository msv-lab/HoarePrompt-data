The code `vvs.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `vvs`. The previous value of `vvs` can either be `[1]` or `[0]` based on the previous condition. Therefore, after executing the code, `vvs` will contain an additional element `0`, resulting in either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 0]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the previous values plus `i`; `dy` is now `[-2, j]`; `vvs` is updated to either [1, 0] or [0, 0] based on the condition; the loop has completed executing for all values of `j` in the specified range from -2 to 2.**
