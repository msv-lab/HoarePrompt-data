Output State: **`ux` and `uy` retain their initial values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` contain at least the same number of elements as the length of `seen`; for each element processed, `seen[u]` is updated to the minimum `num` where applicable; if `seen[u]` is not None and less than or equal to `num`, it remains unchanged. If the loop does not execute, `seen` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
