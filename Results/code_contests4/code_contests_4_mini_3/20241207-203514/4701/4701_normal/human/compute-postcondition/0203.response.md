The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. Since `num` is directly affected by the addition of `pnum` and `vv`, we need to consider the previous values of these variables. Other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `num` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`ux`, `uy`, `xx`, `yy`, `vv`, `vvs`, `dx`, `dy` are calculated based on the values of `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `pnum`; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, and `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`.**
