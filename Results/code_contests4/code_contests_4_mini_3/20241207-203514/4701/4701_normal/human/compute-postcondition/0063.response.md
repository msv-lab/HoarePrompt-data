The code `dx.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `dx`. The previous state of `dx` is not provided, but it is implied that `dx` already contains values repeated for each valid `j`. The value of `i` is used here, and since `i` does not affect the loop's first execution, it simply adds the current value of `i` to the end of the list. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is now `dx` with the value of `i` appended; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`; and `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`; for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is -2, and the condition `not i == j == 0` is true.**
