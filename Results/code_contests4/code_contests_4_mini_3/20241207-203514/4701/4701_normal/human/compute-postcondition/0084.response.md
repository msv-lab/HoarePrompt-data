Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; if `i` and `j` are not both zero, then `dx` is updated to include `i`, and `dy` is updated with `j` appended, resulting in `dy` being `[-2, -1, 1, 2, -2, 2, j]; if `abs(i) + abs(j) > 1`, then `vvs` has an additional value of `1` appended to it; otherwise, `vvs` has an additional value of `0` appended to it; loop conditions remain unchanged.***
