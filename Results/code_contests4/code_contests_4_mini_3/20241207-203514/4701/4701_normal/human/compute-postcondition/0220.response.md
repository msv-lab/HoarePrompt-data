Output State: **`q` is empty, `seen` contains updated minimum values for each valid `u` based on the path taken, `ux` and `uy` are the coordinates derived from the final position `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged, `pnum` reflects the minimum number of steps taken to reach the `goal` if reachable, otherwise it indicates the number of steps taken to explore the reachable positions; `val` is assigned the value of `seen[goal]`.**
