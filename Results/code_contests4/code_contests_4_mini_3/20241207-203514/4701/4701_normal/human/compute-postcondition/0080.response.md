Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` now contains its previous values plus `i`; `dy` is now updated with `j` appended, resulting in `dy` being `[-2, -1, 1, 2, -2, 2, j]`; `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)`; loop conditions remain unchanged.**
