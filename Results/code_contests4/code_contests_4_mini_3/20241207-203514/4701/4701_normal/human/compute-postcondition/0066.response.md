The code `vvs.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `vvs`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, after executing this line, the `vvs` list will now include the value `1` as an additional element. The previous state of `vvs` is not specified, but it will now have one more element.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` is now `dx` with the value of `i` appended; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 1, 2, -2]`; `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`; for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is -2, and the condition `not i == j == 0` is true. The absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1; `vvs` now includes the value `1`.**
