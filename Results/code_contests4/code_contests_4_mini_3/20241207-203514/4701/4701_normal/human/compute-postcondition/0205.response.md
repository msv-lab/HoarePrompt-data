Postcondition: ***`ux`, `uy`, `xx`, `yy`, `vv`, `vvs`, `dx`, `dy` are calculated based on the values of `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `pnum`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is '#', then `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. The program then skips to the next iteration of the loop.***
