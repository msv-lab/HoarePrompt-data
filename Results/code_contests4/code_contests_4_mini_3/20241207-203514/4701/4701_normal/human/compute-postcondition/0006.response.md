The value of `ch` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `ch` is an input integer, and the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ch` is an input integer decreased by 1; `cw` is the second input integer; `dh` and `dw` are assigned new input integers.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ch` is an input integer decreased by 1; `cw` is the second input integer; `dh` and `dw` are assigned new input integers.**
