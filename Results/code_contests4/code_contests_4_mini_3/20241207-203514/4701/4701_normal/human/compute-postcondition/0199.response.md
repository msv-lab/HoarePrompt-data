Postcondition: ***`ux`, `uy`, `xx`, `yy`, `vv`, `x`, `y`, `u`, and `num` are calculated based on the values of `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `pnum`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and `hp(q, (num, u))` is called. If `seen[u]` is already less than or equal to `num`, no changes are made to `seen[u]` and no function call occurs.***
