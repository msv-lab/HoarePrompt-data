`hp(q, (num, u))` involves calling the function `hp` with two arguments: `q` and a tuple containing `num` and `u`. The previous state shows that `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`, but there are no indications that `q`, `num`, or `u` are altered by this function call. Therefore, the output state will reflect the existing values and the function call.

Output State: **`seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`; function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and `(num, u)`**.
