`dh` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `dh` is unknown since it's assigned a new input integer. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dh` has been decreased by 1 but does not specify its exact value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `w` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ch` is an input integer decreased by 1; `cw` is the original input integer decreased by 1; `dh` is decreased by 1; `dw` is assigned a new input integer.**
