Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains `i` repeated for each valid `j`, `dy` is `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`, and `vvs` contains values based on the comparison of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each valid `j`; for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is -2, and `i` does not affect the loop's first execution; the condition `not i == j == 0` is true, indicating that `i` is not equal to `j`, or at least one of them is not zero.***
