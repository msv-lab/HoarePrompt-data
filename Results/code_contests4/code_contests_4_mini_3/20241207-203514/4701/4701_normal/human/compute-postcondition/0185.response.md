Output State: **`ux` and `uy` retain their initial values; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` contain at least the same number of elements as the length of `seen`; `seen[u]` is updated to the minimum `num` where applicable throughout all iterations; if `seen[u]` is not None and less than or equal to `num`, it remains unchanged; the loop has evaluated all elements of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`; and for the loop to execute again, `q` must not be empty; `pnum` and `pu` are assigned the values returned from `hpp(q)`.**
