Output State: **`ux` retains its initial value, `uy` retains its initial value, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` contain at least 1 element each; `xx` is the first element of `dx`, `yy` is the first element of `dy`, `vv` is the first element of `vvs`; `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`; `seen[u]` is now `num` and the function `hp` is called with the arguments `(num, u)`**.
