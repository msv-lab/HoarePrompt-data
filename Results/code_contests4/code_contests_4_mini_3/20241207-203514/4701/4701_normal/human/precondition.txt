H and W are integers representing the dimensions of the maze (1 ≤ H, W ≤ 1000); C_h, C_w, D_h, and D_w are integers representing the starting and destination coordinates (1 ≤ C_h, D_h ≤ H and 1 ≤ C_w, D_w ≤ W); S is a 2D list of characters consisting of '#' (walls) and '.' (roads), with S[C_h][C_w] and S[D_h][D_w] being '.' and (C_h, C_w) ≠ (D_h, D_w).
