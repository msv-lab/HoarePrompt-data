You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A maze is composed of a grid of H \times W squares - H vertical, W horizontal.

The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left - (i,j) - is a wall if S_{ij} is `#` and a road if S_{ij} is `.`.

There is a magician in (C_h,C_w). He can do the following two kinds of moves:

* Move A: Walk to a road square that is vertically or horizontally adjacent to the square he is currently in.
* Move B: Use magic to warp himself to a road square in the 5\times 5 area centered at the square he is currently in.



In either case, he cannot go out of the maze.

At least how many times does he need to use the magic to reach (D_h, D_w)?

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 10^3
* 1 \leq C_h,D_h \leq H
* 1 \leq C_w,D_w \leq W
* S_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* S_{C_h C_w} and S_{D_h D_w} are `.`.
* (C_h,C_w) \neq (D_h,D_w)

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
C_h C_w
D_h D_w
S_{11}\ldots S_{1W}
\vdots
S_{H1}\ldots S_{HW}


Output

Print the minimum number of times the magician needs to use the magic. If he cannot reach (D_h,D_w), print `-1` instead.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: H and W are integers such that 1 <= H, W <= 1000; C_h and C_w are integers such that 1 <= C_h, D_h <= H and 1 <= C_w, D_w <= W; S is a 2D list of characters where each character is either '#' (wall) or '.' (road), and S[C_h][C_w] and S[D_h][D_w] are both '.'; (C_h, C_w) is not equal to (D_h, D_w).
def func():
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    sys.setrecursionlimit(max(1000, 10 ** 9))
    write = lambda x: sys.stdout.write(x + '\n')
    h, w = map(int, input().split())
    ch, cw = map(int, input().split())
    dh, dw = map(int, input().split())
    ch -= 1
    cw -= 1
    dh -= 1
    dw -= 1
    rows, cols = h, w
    OK = '.'
    NG = '#'
    ns = defaultdict(set)
    ss = [None] * rows
    for i in range(rows):
        s = input()
        
        ss[i] = s
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings.
    n = rows * cols
    start = ch * w + cw
    goal = dh * w + dw
    seen = [None] * n
    seen[start] = 0
    q = [(0, start)]
    dx = []
    dy = []
    vvs = []
    for i in range(-2, 3):
        for j in range(-2, 3):
            if not i == j == 0:
                dx.append(i)
                dy.append(j)
                if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1:
                    vvs.append(1)
                else:
                    vvs.append(0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `h` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `ss` is a list containing `h` input strings; `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`; `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`; `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of length `n` with `seen[start]` now being `0`; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the values [-2, -1, 1, 2] repeated for each valid `j`, `dy` contains the values [-2, -1, 1, 2] for the corresponding `i` values, and `vvs` contains five entries: four entries of value 1 for cases where `abs(i) + abs(j) > 1` and one entry of value 0 for the case where `abs(i) + abs(j) = 1`.
    while q:
        pnum, pu = hpp(q)
        
        ux, uy = divmod(pu, w)
        
        if pu == goal:
            break
        
        for xx, yy, vv in zip(dx, dy, vvs):
            x, y = ux + xx, uy + yy
            u = x * w + y
            num = pnum + vv
            if x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or ss[x][y] == '#':
                continue
            if seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num:
                seen[u] = num
                hp(q, (num, u))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `q` is empty, `seen` contains updated minimum values for each valid `u` based on the path taken, `ux` and `uy` are the coordinates derived from the final position `pu`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged, `pnum` reflects the minimum number of steps taken to reach the `goal` if reachable, otherwise it indicates the number of steps taken to explore the reachable positions. If the loop did not execute, `seen` remains unchanged from its initial state.
    val = seen[goal]
    if (val is None) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(val)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`q` is empty, `seen` contains updated minimum values for each valid `u`, and `ux` and `uy` are the coordinates derived from the final position `pu`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged. If `val` is None, -1 is printed, indicating that the goal is not reachable. Otherwise, if `val` is assigned a value from `seen[goal]` that is not None, `pnum` reflects the minimum number of steps taken to reach the goal if reachable, or the number of steps taken to explore reachable positions, and `val` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the dimensions of a grid and two sets of coordinates representing start and goal positions on the grid. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position, moving through valid road cells ('.') while avoiding walls ('#'). If the goal is reachable, it prints the minimum number of steps; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not take parameters directly but relies on input provided via standard input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
