Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned new integer values from input; `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from input; `ai` and `bi` remain unchanged; `bus` is a list of integers; `trol` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `busc1` is an empty list; `bussum` is the sum of `min(x * c1, c2)` for each element `x` in `bus`; `trolsum` is now `min(x * c1, c2)` where `x` is the first element in `trol`.**
