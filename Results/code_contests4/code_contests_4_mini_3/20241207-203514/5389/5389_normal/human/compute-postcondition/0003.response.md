The variable `trol` is assigned a list of integers created by splitting the input string from `raw_input()` and converting each split item to an integer. The other variables (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `n`, `m`, `ai`, `bi`, `bus`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned new integer values from input; `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from input; `ai` and `bi` remain unchanged; `bus` is assigned a list of integers from input; `trol` is a list of integers from `raw_input()`.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned new integer values from input; `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from input; `ai` and `bi` remain unchanged; `bus` is assigned a list of integers from input; `trol` is a list of integers from `raw_input()`**.
