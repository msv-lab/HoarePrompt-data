The variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are assigned the values obtained from a single line of input, which is split into separate values and converted to integers. The previous values of these variables are not specified, so we only know that they will be replaced by the new integers provided in the input. The values of `n`, `m`, `ai`, and `bi` are unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned new integer values from input; `n`, `m`, `ai`, and `bi` remain unchanged.**
