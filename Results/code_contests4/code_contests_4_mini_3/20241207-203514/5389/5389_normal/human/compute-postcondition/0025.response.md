Functionality: ** The function accepts several integer inputs (c1, c2, c3, c4, n, m) and two lists of integers (bus and trol), calculates the total cost based on certain constraints, and prints the result. Specifically, it computes the sum of minimum values for each element in the bus and trol lists multiplied by c1, limited by c2, then further limits the total by c3 and finally by c4 before printing the result. The function does not return a value; it only outputs the computed result directly.**
