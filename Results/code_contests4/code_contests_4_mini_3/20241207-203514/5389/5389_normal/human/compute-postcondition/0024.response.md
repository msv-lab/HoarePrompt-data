The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined with empty parentheses. However, it operates on several constraints and relationships involving the following inputs:

- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers, each ranging from 1 to 1000.
- `n` and `m` are integers, each ranging from 1 to 1000.
- `ai` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer is between 0 and 1000.
- `bi` is a list containing `m` integers, where each integer is between 0 and 1000.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without knowing the specific output conditions or return values, we can only note the accepted inputs and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers c1, c2, c3, c4, n, m, and two lists ai and bi, with specified constraints on their values. The return value is not specified.**
