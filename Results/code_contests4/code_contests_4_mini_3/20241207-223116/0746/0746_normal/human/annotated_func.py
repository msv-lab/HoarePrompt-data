#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: an integer li (1 ≤ li ≤ 1,000,000) representing the length of a block and a character ci (a lowercase English letter) representing the corresponding letter. The first integer in the first tuple represents the number of blocks in string t, and the first integer in the second tuple represents the number of blocks in string s. The total number of blocks n and m satisfies 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000.

    p = []
    for i in ar:
        x = int(i.split('-')[0])

    #The program returns the list of tuples 'p' which contains the sums of the first elements and the corresponding second elements from the input list 'ar'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string is formatted as "length-character". It processes these strings to create a list of tuples `p`, each containing a sum of lengths for consecutive same characters from the input list. It returns this list of tuples, effectively aggregating the lengths based on character grouping. If there are no valid strings in the input, the function will return an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of tuples (`t` and `s`) and a function `c`. It returns the sum of `i[0] - s[0][0] + 1` for each tuple `i` in `t` where `c(i, s[0])` is true if `s` has one element. If `s` has two elements, it counts and returns the number of pairs of consecutive tuples in `t` that satisfy the conditions defined by the first two elements of `s`. If `s` has more than two elements, the function constructs a new list `v` from `s` and `t`, computes a prefix function `p`, and counts the occurrences where the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix matches the specified conditions based on `c`. The function does not handle cases where `s` has zero elements or where `t` is empty, which could lead to potential errors.
