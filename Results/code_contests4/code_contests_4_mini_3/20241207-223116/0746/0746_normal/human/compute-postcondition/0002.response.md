According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `t`. If `t` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. The variable `ans` being 0 does not affect the execution of the loop. Since the state of `c` indicates the number of blocks in `t`, it implies that `c` must be greater than 0 for the loop to iterate. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `t` must have at least one tuple, and `i` will be the first tuple in `t` during the first iteration.

State: **`ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, and `i` is the first tuple in `t`**
