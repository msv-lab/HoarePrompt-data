The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1]`. The current value of `i` is 2, so the expression evaluates to `p[1]`. The initial state does not provide information about the value of `p`, so we cannot determine the specific value of `j`. The other variables (`ans` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is assigned the value of `p[1]` (which is unknown).

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is assigned the value of `p[1]` (which is unknown)**
