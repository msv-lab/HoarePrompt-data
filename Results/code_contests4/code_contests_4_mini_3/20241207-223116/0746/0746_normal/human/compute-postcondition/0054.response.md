The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` can either be 0 or a value such that `v[j]` equals `v[2]`, the new value of `j` will be 1 or an incremented value depending on its previous state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is either 1 or an incremented value; `ans` is 0; `i` is 2; `v[j]` equals `v[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is either 1 or an incremented value; `ans` is 0; `i` is 2; `v[j]` equals `v[2]**
