`j` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `j` will be assigned the value of `p[0]`. The values of `ans` and `len(v)` are not directly affected by this assignment, and no return is specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is assigned the value of `p[0]`.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is assigned the value of `p[0]**
