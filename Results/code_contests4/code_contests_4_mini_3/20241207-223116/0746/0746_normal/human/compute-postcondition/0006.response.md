According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `t`. If the list has at least one more tuple after the current tuple, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first tuple in `t`, and since it is being iterated over, we need to increment `i` to the next tuple in the list for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a list of tuples, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must contain at least 2 tuples, and `i` must be the second tuple in `t`.**
