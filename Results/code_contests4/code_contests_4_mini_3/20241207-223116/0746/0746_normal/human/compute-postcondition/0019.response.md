Postcondition: ***`ans` is 1 if the first element of `t` satisfies the condition `c(t[i], s[0])` and the second element of `t` satisfies the condition `c(t[i + 1], s[1])`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `t` is a list with at least 2 elements, `s` is a list of length 2, and `i` is 0, ensuring that the loop can execute.***
