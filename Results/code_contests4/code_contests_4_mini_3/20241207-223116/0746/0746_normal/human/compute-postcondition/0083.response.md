The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `c`. Here are the details of each parameter:

1. `t`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer (representing the length of a block) and a character (representing a corresponding lowercase English letter).
2. `s`: A list of tuples, where each tuple also contains an integer (representing the length of a block) and a character (representing a corresponding lowercase English letter).
3. `c`: An integer representing the number of blocks in the list `t`.

The function has three distinct return cases:
- **Case 1**: The function returns the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `i[0] - s[0][0] + 1` for each tuple `i` in list `t` where a certain condition involving `c` and `s[0]` is true.
- **Case 2**: The function returns the count of pairs of consecutive elements in list `t` that satisfy specific conditions defined by the elements in list `s`.
- **Case 3**: The function returns the count of valid conditions met based on comparisons of `p` and `c`, which is stored in the variable `ans`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two lists of tuples (`t` and `s`) and an integer (`c`), and return different values based on various conditions related to the elements of these lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of tuples (`t` and `s`), and an integer `c`. It returns either the sum of specific calculations based on conditions from `t` and `s`, the count of valid pairs of consecutive elements in `t`, or the count of valid conditions based on comparisons of `p` and `c`.**
