`ans` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `ans` is 1, after execution, `ans` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `len(v)` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, `len(v)` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`ans` is 2, `i` is 1, `len(v)` must be greater than 1**
