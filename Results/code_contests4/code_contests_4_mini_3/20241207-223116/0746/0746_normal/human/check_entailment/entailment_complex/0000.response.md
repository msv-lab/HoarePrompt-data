To evaluate the correctness of the given Python code against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its annotations thoroughly.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires finding the number of occurrences of a compressed string `s` within another compressed string `t`. The input consists of blocks described in the format "li-ci", where `li` is the length of the block, and `ci` is the corresponding character. 

### Code Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function converts a list of strings in the format "li-ci" into a list of tuples aggregating the lengths of consecutive identical characters. This seems to be a necessary preprocessing step to facilitate the search for string `s` in string `t`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Handles three cases based on the length of `s`:
     - If `s` has one block, it calculates occurrences based on the lengths of blocks in `t` that match the first block of `s`.
     - If `s` has two blocks, it counts pairs of consecutive blocks in `t` that match the blocks in `s`.
     - If `s` has more than two blocks, it constructs a new list `v` and computes a prefix function to find occurrences based on the longest prefix that is also a suffix.

### Potential Issues
- **Case of Empty Input**: The code does not seem to handle the case where `s` or `t` could potentially be empty. While the constraints suggest at least one block is present, not validating input could lead to unexpected behavior in edge cases.
- **Single Block Matching Logic**: When `s` has only one block, it might incorrectly count overlapping blocks if not all conditions are met. This could lead to erroneous counts, especially when lengths of blocks in `s` and `t` match closely but characters do not.
- **Prefix Function Logic**: The logic for counting occurrences when `s` has more than two blocks involves complex prefix matching, which might not account accurately for overlapping blocks or mismatched characters.

### Example Cases
To illustrate the potential failure:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1 1
  4-a
  2-a
  ```
  In this case, the output should be `0` because while `t` has four 'a's, `s` requires two 'a's contiguous, and the logic needs to ensure it only counts valid matches.
  
- Another input:
  ```
  3 3
  1-a 1-b 1-c
  1-a 1-b 1-c
  ```
  Here, the output should be `1`, but the logic in `func_2` might miscount occurrences based on its handling of the prefix function.

### Conclusion
Given these observations, the code does not ensure accurate matching for all potential cases outlined in the problem description. Since it could potentially give incorrect results based on the edge cases identified, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
