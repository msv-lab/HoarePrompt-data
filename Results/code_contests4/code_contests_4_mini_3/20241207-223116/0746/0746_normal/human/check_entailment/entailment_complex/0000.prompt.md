You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Each employee of the "Blake Techologies" company uses a special messaging app "Blake Messenger". All the stuff likes this app and uses it constantly. However, some important futures are missing. For example, many users want to be able to search through the message history. It was already announced that the new feature will appear in the nearest update, when developers faced some troubles that only you may help them to solve.

All the messages are represented as a strings consisting of only lowercase English letters. In order to reduce the network load strings are represented in the special compressed form. Compression algorithm works as follows: string is represented as a concatenation of n blocks, each block containing only equal characters. One block may be described as a pair (li, ci), where li is the length of the i-th block and ci is the corresponding letter. Thus, the string s may be written as the sequence of pairs <image>.

Your task is to write the program, that given two compressed string t and s finds all occurrences of s in t. Developers know that there may be many such occurrences, so they only ask you to find the number of them. Note that p is the starting position of some occurrence of s in t if and only if tptp + 1...tp + |s| - 1 = s, where ti is the i-th character of string t.

Note that the way to represent the string in compressed form may not be unique. For example string "aaaa" may be given as <image>, <image>, <image>...

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200 000) — the number of blocks in the strings t and s, respectively.

The second line contains the descriptions of n parts of string t in the format "li-ci" (1 ≤ li ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the i-th part and the corresponding lowercase English letter.

The second line contains the descriptions of m parts of string s in the format "li-ci" (1 ≤ li ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the i-th part and the corresponding lowercase English letter.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of occurrences of s in t.

Note

In the first sample, t = "aaabbccccaaacc", and string s = "aabbc". The only occurrence of string s in string t starts at position p = 2.

In the second sample, t = "aaabbbbbbaaaaaaacccceeeeeeeeaa", and s = "aaa". The occurrences of s in t start at positions p = 1, p = 10, p = 11, p = 12, p = 13 and p = 14.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: an integer li (1 ≤ li ≤ 1,000,000) representing the length of a block and a character ci (a lowercase English letter) representing the corresponding letter. The first integer in the first tuple represents the number of blocks in string t, and the first integer in the second tuple represents the number of blocks in string s. The total number of blocks n and m satisfies 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000.
def func_1(ar):
    p = []
    for i in ar:
        x = int(i.split('-')[0])
        
        c = i.split('-')[1]
        
        if len(p) > 0 and p[-1][1] == c:
            p[-1][0] += x
        else:
            p.append([x, c])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a sum of the first elements and the corresponding second elements from the input list `ar`, `ar` is a list of tuples where each tuple is in the format (number, category).
    return p
    #The program returns the list of tuples 'p' which contains the sums of the first elements and the corresponding second elements from the input list 'ar'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string is formatted as "length-character". It processes these strings to create a list of tuples `p`, each containing a sum of lengths for consecutive same characters from the input list. It returns this list of tuples, effectively aggregating the lengths based on character grouping. If there are no valid strings in the input, the function will return an empty list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t and s are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer representing the length of a block (li) and a character representing the corresponding lowercase English letter (ci). c is an integer representing the number of blocks in t.

        return ans
        #The program returns the value of 'ans', which is the sum of 'i[0] - s[0][0] + 1' for each tuple 'i' in list 't' where the condition 'c(i, s[0])' is true.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ans` is 0; `t` and `s` are lists of tuples; `c` is an integer representing the number of blocks in `t`; the length of `s` is not equal to 1.

        for i in range(len(t) - 1):
            if c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1]):
                ans += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the count of pairs of consecutive elements in `t` that satisfy the conditions `c(t[i], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 1], s[1])`; `t` is a list with at least 2 elements; `s` is a list of length 2; `i` is `len(t) - 1` if the loop executes, or remains 0 if the loop does not execute.

    p = [0] * len(v)
    for i in range(1, len(v)):
        j = p[i - 1]
        
        while j > 0 and v[j] != v[i]:
            j = p[j]
        
        if v[j] == v[i]:
            j += 1

    return ans
    #The program returns the count of valid conditions met based on the comparisons of p and c, stored in variable 'ans'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of tuples (`t` and `s`) and a function `c`. It returns the sum of `i[0] - s[0][0] + 1` for each tuple `i` in `t` where `c(i, s[0])` is true if `s` has one element. If `s` has two elements, it counts and returns the number of pairs of consecutive tuples in `t` that satisfy the conditions defined by the first two elements of `s`. If `s` has more than two elements, the function constructs a new list `v` from `s` and `t`, computes a prefix function `p`, and counts the occurrences where the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix matches the specified conditions based on `c`. The function does not handle cases where `s` has zero elements or where `t` is empty, which could lead to potential errors.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
