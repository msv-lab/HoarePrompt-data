To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function's logic step by step and see if it accurately counts the occurrences of the compressed string `s` in the compressed string `t`. 

### Breakdown of the Program

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
    - This function takes a list of compressed string blocks and converts it into a more simplified format by merging consecutive blocks of the same character.
    - The output is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the total length of consecutive blocks and the character.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
    - This function is responsible for counting occurrences of the string `s` in the string `t`.
    - It handles three cases based on the length of `s`:
        - **Length 1**: It counts occurrences where the block in `t` can fit the length of the block in `s`.
        - **Length 2**: It counts pairs of consecutive blocks in `t` that match the two blocks in `s`.
        - **Length > 2**: It constructs a new list `v` by combining parts of `s` and all of `t`, and uses a prefix function (similar to KMP algorithm) to count occurrences of `s` in `t`.

### Verifying Logic Against the Problem Description

- The problem asks for counting occurrences of the compressed representation of string `s` in that of string `t`.
- The program correctly processes the input by merging consecutive blocks in `func_1`.
- In `func_2`, it correctly counts occurrences based on the length of `s`, ensuring that it checks both individual blocks and combinations of blocks.
- The logic for constructing the `v` list and using the prefix function is appropriate for handling cases where `s` has more than two blocks, as it effectively looks for overlaps and matches.

### Edge Cases

- The program handles edge cases such as:
    - Single character occurrences.
    - Consecutive block matches (length 2).
    - Larger strings with multiple blocks.

### Conclusion

After analyzing each part of the program and its alignment with the problem description, we find that the program correctly implements the required functionality to count occurrences of `s` in `t`. Therefore, it meets all the requirements specified.

Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
