To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, we will evaluate the functionality of the two functions against the problem description and the output hints.

### Analysis of Code

1. **Function `func_1(ar)`**:
   - This function takes a list of strings formatted as "length-character" and aggregates consecutive characters into a list of tuples containing the total length and character.
   - The algorithm seems correct in collapsing the consecutive characters into their total lengths.

2. **Function `func_2(t, s, c)`**:
   - This function searches for occurrences of the compressed string `s` within the compressed string `t`.
   - For single character matches, it counts how many times the character in `s` can be matched in `t` based on their lengths.
   - For two characters, it checks for consecutive matching blocks in `t`.
   - For more than two characters, it constructs a new list and uses a prefix function to count occurrences, which is a valid approach.

### Edge Cases
- The main edge cases that could potentially cause issues:
  - **Empty Input Handling**: The problem description doesn't specify what happens if either `t` or `s` is empty. However, based on the constraints `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000`, this shouldn't be an issue.
  - **Single Block Matches**: The code handles single character matches but may not consider cases where there are multiple blocks of the same character in `s` and their lengths matter.
  - **Non-Consecutive Characters**: The function assumes all characters in `s` can be found directly in `t` as consecutive blocks, which might miss cases where the total lengths could fit but are separated by other characters.

### Output Hints Analysis
- The output hints suggest that the function handles counts correctly based on the lengths and characters.
- The hints mentioned for `func_2` indicate that it does not handle cases where `s` has zero elements or where `t` is empty, which could lead to potential errors. However, given the input constraints, it seems this is not an immediate concern.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the functions and the hints, there are concerns regarding:
- How the function handles cases where multiple blocks of characters in `s` are not consecutive but could fit into `t` based on the lengths.
- The potential misinterpretation of the problem when `s` contains multiple blocks of the same character, where the function does not consider all valid overlapping combinations.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly regarding how substring occurrences are counted in relation to the block lengths.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for cases where multiple occurrences of the same character can be interspersed with others in `t`, leading to an incorrect count of occurrences of `s`.
