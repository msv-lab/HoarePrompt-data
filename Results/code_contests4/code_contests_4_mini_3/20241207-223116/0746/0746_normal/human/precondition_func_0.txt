ar is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: an integer li (1 ≤ li ≤ 1,000,000) representing the length of a block and a character ci (a lowercase English letter) representing the corresponding letter. The first integer in the first tuple represents the number of blocks in string t, and the first integer in the second tuple represents the number of blocks in string s. The total number of blocks n and m satisfies 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000.
