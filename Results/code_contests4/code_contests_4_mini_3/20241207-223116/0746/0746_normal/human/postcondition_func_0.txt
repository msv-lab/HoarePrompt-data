The function accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string is formatted as "length-character". It processes these strings to create a list of tuples `p`, each containing a sum of lengths for consecutive same characters from the input list. It returns this list of tuples, effectively aggregating the lengths based on character grouping. If there are no valid strings in the input, the function will return an empty list.
