To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and see if it handles all potential cases as described.

The program involves two main functions:

1. `func_1`: This function takes a list of compressed string descriptions and converts them into a more manageable format (a list of pairs where each pair contains the length and character).

2. `func_2`: This function is responsible for finding the number of occurrences of the compressed string `s` in the compressed string `t`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function checks for edge cases when the length of `s` is 1 or 2, counting occurrences directly for these cases.
- For longer strings, it constructs a list `v` that combines both strings and uses a KMP-like approach (using the array `p` for prefix lengths) to find matches.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Single Character Blocks**: If `t` and `s` contain blocks of the same character but with different counts, the program needs to ensure it can still find matches. For example, if `t` has `1-a 2-a` and `s` has `2-a`, it should correctly identify the match.
   
2. **Non-Matching Blocks**: If `s` has blocks that do not exist in `t`, the program should return `0`. For instance, `t` as `1-b 1-c` and `s` as `1-a` should return `0`.

3. **Overlapping Counts**: If `t` has an occurrence of `s` that overlaps (e.g., `t` being `3-a 3-b` and `s` being `2-a 1-b`), the program must correctly count these instances.

4. **Edge Lengths**: The program assumes that the sizes of `t` and `s` are within the limits provided. However, if `s` is longer than `t`, it should return `0`, which it seems to handle but should be checked for correctness.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the provided code and considering various possible edge cases based on the problem description, I found that there is a potential case where the logic might not handle certain overlaps correctly, particularly with how it counts occurrences in `func_2`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements effectively in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
