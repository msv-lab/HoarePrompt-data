The program is intended to find the number of occurrences of a compressed string `s` in another compressed string `t`. 

To analyze the correctness, let's break down the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1(ar)`**: This function converts the compressed representation of the strings into a list where each element is a list containing the length of the block and the character. It appears to correctly handle the merging of consecutive blocks with the same character.

2. **Function `func_2(t, s, c)`**: This function counts occurrences of the compressed string `s` in `t` using a comparison function `c`. The logic includes handling cases where `s` has one or two blocks separately. For longer patterns, it builds an auxiliary array `v` which includes `s` and `t` to facilitate the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm for pattern matching.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function assumes that both `t` and `s` are well-formed and do not have any empty blocks. It also doesn't handle cases where the lengths of the blocks in `s` exceed the corresponding blocks in `t`.
   - The code does not ensure that the total length of `s` can actually fit within `t`. For example, if `s` has a character with a length greater than the corresponding character in `t`, it would incorrectly count as an occurrence.

### Potential Case Where It Fails:
Consider the case where:
- `t` consists of a character 'a' with length 5 (i.e., `5-a`).
- `s` consists of a character 'a' with length 6 (i.e., `6-a`).
In this case, there should be **0 occurrences** of `s` in `t`, as `t` cannot accommodate the full block of `s`. However, due to the logic in the code which counts occurrences without checking the block lengths against each other, it may incorrectly count an occurrence if the character matches.

### Conclusion:
Considering the analysis above, since the program does not account for block length mismatches and can produce incorrect results in certain scenarios, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
