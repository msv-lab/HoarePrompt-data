Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. 

### Reasons for Incorrectness:

1. **Prime Number Generation**: The program attempts to find prime numbers up to the maximum element of the input sequence (`N`). However, it does not account for the fact that the queries (`li`, `ri`) can be larger than `N`, up to `2 * 10^9`. The program attempts to handle this by restricting `r` and `l` to `N`, but this leads to incorrect results since there may be prime numbers in the range `[li, ri]` that are greater than `N`.

2. **Handling of Queries**: When a query is processed, if `l > N`, it sets `l` to `N + 1`, which ignores any primes that may exist below `l` but above the maximum value in the input list. This means that if there are primes in the range `[li, ri]` that are greater than `N`, they are not counted in the results at all, leading to inaccuracies.

### Example Case:

Consider the following input:

```
6
5 5 7 10 14 15
1
2 20
```

The correct output should consider all primes between 2 and 20, which are: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19`. The function `f(p)` for these primes would yield:

- f(2) = 2
- f(3) = 1
- f(5) = 4
- f(7) = 2
- f(11) = 0
- f(13) = 0
- f(17) = 0
- f(19) = 0

The sum should be `2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9`. However, because the program restricts the search for primes to `N`, it will incorrectly ignore primes like `11, 13, 17, 19`, resulting in an incorrect output.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for all potential cases.
