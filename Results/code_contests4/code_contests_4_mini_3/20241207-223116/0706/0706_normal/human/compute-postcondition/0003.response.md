According to the code, the loop iterates using `i` over the range defined by `len(li) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of the list `li` must be greater than 1. Given that `n` is defined such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, it is possible for `li` to be of length 1 or less, which would prevent the loop from executing.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. Ensure that `li` has a length of at least 2 to allow for the loop to execute.
2. Initialize `i` to 0, which is the starting point of the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, the sequence of integers is a list of integers `x` of length `n`, `li` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
