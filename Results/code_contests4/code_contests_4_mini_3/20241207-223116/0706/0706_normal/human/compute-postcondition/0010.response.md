The code writes the last element of the list `li` to standard output. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation; however, the last element of `li` is outputted. Since `li` has at least 2 elements, `li[-1]` is defined and will be printed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `li` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is `len(li) - 1`; the last element of `li` has been written to stdout.**
