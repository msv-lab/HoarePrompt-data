The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `li`. `li` is an integer and part of a sequence of queries characterized by two integers `li` and `ri`. The function does not specify a return value after the return statement, implying that it may not return any meaningful output or could potentially return `None`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `li` as part of a query but does not provide a defined return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `li`, which is an integer, and does not return any specified value.**
