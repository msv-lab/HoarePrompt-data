The code writes the value of the third element of the list `li` (indexed by `i`, which is 2) to standard output. Since `li` is guaranteed to have at least 3 elements, the value of `li[2]` is valid and will be printed. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `x` is a list of integers of length `n`; `li` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; the third element of `li` is printed to stdout.**
