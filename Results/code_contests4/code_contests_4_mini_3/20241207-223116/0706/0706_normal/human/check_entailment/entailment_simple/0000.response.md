Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Functionality**: The problem description requires the program to handle a sequence of integers and respond to multiple queries regarding the count of prime numbers within specific ranges and their divisibility by the integers in that sequence. However, the annotated program consists of three separate functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) that do not implement the required logic for processing queries or calculating the necessary sums based on the divisibility of the integers in the sequence.

2. **Input Handling**: While `func_1` and `func_3` read input, they do not perform any operations to count the number of integers in the sequence that are divisible by the prime numbers within the specified ranges. The input reading functions do not integrate into a cohesive program that processes the queries.

3. **Prime Number Identification**: There is no implementation in the program to identify prime numbers in the given range `[li, ri]`, which is crucial for solving the problem as described. The program lacks any algorithmic structure to determine the primes and subsequently calculate their contributions to the result for each query.

4. **Output Logic**: The program does not have any mechanism to output the results for each query as required. The expected output is a list of integers representing the sums for each query, but the current implementation does not produce this output in any form.

In summary, the program does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as outlined in the description, making it incorrect. The absence of functions to handle prime number detection, divisibility checks, and the lack of output generation for the queries means that it fails to fulfill the task assigned.
