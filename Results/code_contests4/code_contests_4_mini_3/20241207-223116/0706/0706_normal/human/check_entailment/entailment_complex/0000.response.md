Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The problem requires the program to handle multiple queries regarding prime numbers within specified ranges and to calculate a sum based on the divisibility of the given integers by these primes. However, the functions in the code do not perform any calculations related to prime numbers, divisibility, or query handling.

1. **Function 1** only reads integers from input but does not process them or return any meaningful structure related to the problems described.
2. **Function 2** appears to print elements of a list but does not perform any calculations related to the queries or prime numbers.
3. **Function 3** reads a single line from input but does not correlate with the query handling or the prime number calculation required by the problem.

There are no mechanisms in the code to find prime numbers within the specified ranges or to compute the required sums based on the provided queries. This is a critical part of the problem, and without such logic, the program cannot provide correct answers to the queries described in the problem statement.

Additionally, edge cases, such as queries with ranges that do not contain any prime numbers, are not addressed in the code, as it does not implement the logic to determine primes or their contributions to the sums based on divisibility.

Therefore, the program fails to fulfill the problem's requirements for handling every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
