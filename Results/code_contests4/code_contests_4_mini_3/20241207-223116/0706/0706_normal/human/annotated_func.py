def func_1():

    #The program returns a map object containing the integers read from the standard input, split into a list of values, and converted to long integers. The input consists of space-separated integers provided via stdin.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads space-separated integers from standard input, converts them to long integers, and returns a map object containing those integers. It does not handle any edge cases related to input format or validity, such as ensuring that the input is within the specified ranges or managing any potential exceptions that may arise from invalid input.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, the sequence of integers is a list of integers `x` of length `n` where each integer `x_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 10^7, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 50000, and each query is characterized by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 2 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 2·10^9. Additionally, `l_i` is a non-zero integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `li` and prints all elements of the list to standard output, except the last one, which is printed on a new line. If `li` is empty, the function returns without doing anything. The function does not specify a return value, effectively returning `None`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, the sequence of integers consists of n integers where each integer xi satisfies 2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50000, and each query is characterized by two integers li and ri such that 2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9.

    #The program returns a single line of input from standard input, which is a string with potential trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a string read from standard input, with any trailing whitespace removed. It is designed to handle a single line of input, but it does not specifically account for edge cases such as empty input or input exceeding the expected constraints.
