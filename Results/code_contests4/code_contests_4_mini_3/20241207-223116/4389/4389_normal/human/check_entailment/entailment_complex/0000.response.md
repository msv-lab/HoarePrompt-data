Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Condition on m and n**: The program prematurely concludes that if `m < n` or `n == 2`, it should return -1. However, the problem states that the landlord requires exactly `m` chains, which can be less than `n`. Specifically, the problem description states that if there are only two fridges (`n=2`) and one chain (`m=1`), it is indeed possible to create a situation where both fridges are not private. The code does not account for the possibility of valid configurations when `n=2` and `m=1`.

2. **Connection Logic**: The logic used for connecting fridges is incorrect. The program connects each fridge `i` to fridge `(i % n + 1)`. This results in a circular connection that does not necessarily ensure privacy as required by the problem description. The connections need to be made in a way that guarantees that only the owner can open their fridge, which is not achieved with the current implementation.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the total cost as `2 * sum(a)`, which does not reflect the actual cost of creating the required number of chains. The cost should be based on the specific pairs of fridges that are being connected, following the rule of `a_u + a_v`.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases as specified. It only appends results to a list `af` but does not print or return the results in the required format.

Given these points, the program does not satisfy the conditions laid out in the problem description and fails to handle some edge cases properly, leading to incorrect outputs.
