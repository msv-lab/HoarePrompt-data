Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Condition Check for Valid Chains**: The condition in the program `if (m < n or n == 2)` is incorrect. The problem states that if there are `n` fridges and the number of chains `m` must be exactly `m`, where `1 ≤ m ≤ n`. The logic should only check if `m` is less than `n` (which would not allow for all fridges to be private) and should not return -1 for the case where `n == 2` as long as `m` is valid.

2. **Output of Chains**: The way the program generates chains in the loop `for k in range(n): af.append(str(k + 1) + ' ' + str((k + 1) % n + 1))` connects fridge `k+1` to fridge `(k+1) % n + 1`, which results in a circular connection. This does not guarantee privacy for the fridges according to the problem description, as it allows other people to open fridges that should be private.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost calculated as `2 * sum(a)` does not represent the minimum cost of creating the chains to ensure that all fridges remain private. The cost should take into account the specific weights of the fridges involved in the connections rather than just doubling the sum of all weights.

4. **Handling of Cases Where No Solution Exists**: The program does not properly handle cases where it is impossible to create `m` chains according to the requirements. The logic should allow checks for scenarios where `m` cannot be satisfied.

In summary, the program fails to ensure that each fridge is private and does not correctly calculate the total cost of the chains, thus failing to meet the specifications outlined in the problem description.
