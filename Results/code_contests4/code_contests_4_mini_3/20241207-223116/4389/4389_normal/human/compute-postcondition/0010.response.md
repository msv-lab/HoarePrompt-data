The code appends a string to the list `af`. The string consists of two parts: `str(k + 1)` and `str((k + 1) % n + 1)`. 

1. The value of `k` is 1, so `k + 1` is 2.
2. The first part of the string is `str(k + 1)`, which is `str(2)` or `'2'`.
3. For the second part, we calculate `(k + 1) % n + 1`, which is `2 % n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `2 % n` will be 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it would be 0. Therefore, the second part can be either:
   - If `n >= 2`: `2 % n + 1` gives 2 + 1 = 3.
   - If `n == 1`: `2 % 1 + 1` gives 0 + 1 = 1.
4. Thus, the string being appended to `af` could be either `'2 3'` if `n >= 2` or `'2 1'` if `n == 1`.

However, since the initial state indicates `n` must be greater than 0 and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, we can safely conclude that `n` is at least 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `k` is 1; `af` is appended with '2 3'.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `k` is 1; `af` is appended with '2 3'**.
