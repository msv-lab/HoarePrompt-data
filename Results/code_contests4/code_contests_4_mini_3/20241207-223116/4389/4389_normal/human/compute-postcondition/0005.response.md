Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned an integer value from the input, `m` is assigned an integer value from the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`. It is not the case that `m` is less than `n` and `n` is not equal to 2, which means `m` is greater than or equal to `n` and `n` is not equal to 2.***
