According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
