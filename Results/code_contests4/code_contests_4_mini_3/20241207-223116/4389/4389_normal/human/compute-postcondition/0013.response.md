The loop iterates `n` times, appending a new string to the list `af` in each iteration. The string consists of the current iteration index plus one and the result of that index plus one modulo `n` plus one. After the loop completes, the value of `k` will be `n-1`, and `af` will contain `n` new elements based on the iteration.

If `n = 0`, the loop does not execute, and `af` will remain unchanged, containing only the initial element which is `2 * sum(a)`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is `n - 1` if `n` > 0, `af` contains `n` strings of the format 'i (i % n + 1)' for i from 1 to n, and `af` includes the initial element which is `2 * sum(a)`**
