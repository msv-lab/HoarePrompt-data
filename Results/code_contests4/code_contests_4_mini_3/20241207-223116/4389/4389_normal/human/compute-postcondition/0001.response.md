The last element of `le` is split into strings and then mapped to integers, resulting in a list assigned to `a`. The values of `n` and `m` are extracted from the input previously provided, and since they are integers, they are unaffected by this operation. The output state reflects the new variable `a` holding the list of integers derived from the last element of `le`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an integer value from the input, `m` is assigned an integer value from the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`.**
