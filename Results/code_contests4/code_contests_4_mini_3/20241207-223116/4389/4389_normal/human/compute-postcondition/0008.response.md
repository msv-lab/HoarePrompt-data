The code appends a new string to the list `af`. The string consists of two parts: the first part is `str(k + 1)` and the second part is `str((k + 1) % n + 1)`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is 0

Calculating the values:
- `k + 1` is `0 + 1`, which equals `1`
- Next, we calculate `(k + 1) % n + 1` which is `1 % n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `1 % n` will always equal `1` when `n` is greater than 1, and equal to `1` when `n` is 1. Thus, `1 % n + 1` equals `1 + 1`, which equals `2`.

Therefore, the string that gets appended to `af` is `'1 2'`. 

The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is 0
- `m` is assigned an integer value from the input
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`
- `af` now includes the new element which is `2 * sum(a)` along with the newly appended string `'1 2'`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `m` is assigned an integer value from the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`, `af` now includes the new element which is `2 * sum(a)` and the new element `'1 2'`.**
