The code appends a string to the list `af`. The string consists of two parts: the value of `k + 1` and the value of `(k + 1) % n + 1`. Since `k` is 2, `k + 1` equals 3. Therefore, the first part of the string is `3`. For the second part, we need to calculate `(k + 1) % n + 1`, which is `3 % n + 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, the result of `3 % n` will depend on the specific value of `n`. However, since `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, we can conclude that `3 % n` will be 3 if `n` is greater than 3, or it will be 2 if `n` is 3, and thus `(k + 1) % n + 1` will either be 4 or 3 depending on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output state can be expressed as:
- If `n` is greater than 3: The string appended is "3 4".
- If `n` is exactly 3: The string appended is "3 3".

Since the output must account for both possible scenarios based on the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 2; `af` now contains "3 4" if `n` > 3 or "3 3" if `n` = 3**.
