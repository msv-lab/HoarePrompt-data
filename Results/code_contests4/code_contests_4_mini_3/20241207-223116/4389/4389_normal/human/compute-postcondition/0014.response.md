The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the weights of the fridges. After executing the function body, it returns `None`, indicating that no value is returned. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process multiple test cases related to fridges but does not provide a return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns None, indicating no value is returned.**
