Functionality: ** The function processes input consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers representing weights. If `m` is less than `n` or `n` equals 2, it appends -1 to a list `af` and returns None. Otherwise, it appends twice the sum of the weights to `af` and then appends `n` strings in the format 'i (i % n + 1)' for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns None. **
