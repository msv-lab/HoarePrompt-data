According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The states that need to be adjusted are `n`, `k`, which will start at 0 for the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `k` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `m` is assigned an integer value from the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`, `af` now includes a new element which is `2 * sum(a)`**
