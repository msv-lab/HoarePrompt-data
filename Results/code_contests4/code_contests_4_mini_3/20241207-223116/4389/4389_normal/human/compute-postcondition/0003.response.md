The code `af.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `af`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified directly in the initial state regarding `af`, but `af` is assumed to be a list that exists prior to this operation. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer assigned from input, `m` is an integer assigned from input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`, either `m` is less than `n` or `n` is equal to 2, and `-1` is appended to the list `af`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned from input, `m` is an integer assigned from input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`, either `m` is less than `n` or `n` is equal to 2, and `-1` is appended to the list `af`.**
