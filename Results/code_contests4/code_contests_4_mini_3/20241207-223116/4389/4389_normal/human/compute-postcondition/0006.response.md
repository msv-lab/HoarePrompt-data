The code appends the value `2 * sum(a)` to the list `af`. The variable `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`, and since `af` is not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be an existing list. The operation will not affect `n`, `m`, or `a` directly, but will modify `af` by adding a new element.

The function `sum(a)` computes the sum of the elements in the list `a`, and then this sum is multiplied by 2 before being appended to `af`. The specific values of `n`, `m`, and `a` are not provided, but we know that `m` is greater than or equal to `n` and `n` is not equal to 2.

Therefore, the Output State after executing the code would be that `af` has a new element which is `2 * sum(a)`, while `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an integer value from the input, `m` is assigned an integer value from the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`, and `af` now includes a new element which is `2 * sum(a)`**.
