The function takes input from standard input with multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers n (the number of people, 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and m (the number of required steel chains, 1 ≤ m ≤ n), followed by a list of n non-negative integers representing the weights of fridges (each weight a_i, 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4).
