#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n), followed by a list of n integers representing the weights of the fridges (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4).
def func_1():
    n, m = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
    a = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
    if (m < n or n == 2) :
        af.append(-1)
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating no value is returned.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is assigned an integer value from the input, `m` is assigned an integer value from the input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the last element of `le`. It is not the case that `m` is less than `n` and `n` is not equal to 2, which means `m` is greater than or equal to `n` and `n` is not equal to 2.
    af.append(2 * sum(a))
    for k in range(n):
        af.append(str(k + 1) + ' ' + str((k + 1) % n + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `k` is `n - 1` if `n` > 0, `af` contains `n` strings of the format 'i (i % n + 1)' for i from 1 to n, and `af` includes the initial element which is `2 * sum(a)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers representing weights. If `m` is less than `n` or `n` equals 2, it appends -1 to a list `af` and returns None. Otherwise, it appends twice the sum of the weights to `af` and then appends `n` strings in the format 'i (i % n + 1)' for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns None.
