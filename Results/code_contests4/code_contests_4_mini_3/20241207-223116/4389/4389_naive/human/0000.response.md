To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program against the requirements given in the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. There are `n` fridges, and we need to create exactly `m` chains between them.
2. A fridge is considered private if only its owner can open it.
3. The landlord wants to minimize the total cost of creating these chains.
4. If no solution exists for creating the required number of chains while keeping the fridges private, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads multiple test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It checks if `m < n` or if `n == 2` to determine if a solution is possible.
   - If the conditions are met, it appends `-1` to the result list (`af`), indicating no solution.
   - If a solution is possible, it calculates the total cost as `2 * sum(a)`, which seems to imply that it connects each fridge to the next in a circular manner.
   - Finally, it prints the connections made.

### Key Observations:
- The check `if m < n or n == 2` is crucial:
  - If `m < n`, it means we cannot create a unique connection for each fridge, which can lead to non-privacy.
  - If `n == 2`, with only one chain (when `m = 1`), both fridges can open each other, which violates privacy.

### Potential Issue:
- The program does not handle the case where `m` is exactly `n`. The program assumes that if `m` is at least `n`, it can create a circular connection, which might not guarantee privacy. For instance:
  - If `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the program creates connections like (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1) which allows each fridge to be opened by another person (not just the owner).

### Example of Failure:
- Consider a case where `n = 3` and `m = 3`:
  - The weights `a = [1, 2, 3]`.
  - The connections created would be:
    ```
    1 2
    2 3
    3 1
    ```
  - In this scenario, fridge 1 can be opened by fridge 2, fridge 2 can be opened by fridge 3, and fridge 3 can be opened by fridge 1, thus violating the privacy requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in how it determines the possibility of privacy for the fridges when `m` equals `n`. Since there exists at least one case where the program does not comply with the problem requirements, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
