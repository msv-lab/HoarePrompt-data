You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Enter a positive integer n of 4,000 or less, with a pair of integers a, b, c, d in the range 0-1000.


a + b + c + d = n


Create a program that outputs the number of combinations that satisfy the conditions.



Input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is given n on one row. Please process until the end of the input.

The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

Output

For each data set, output the number of combinations of a, b, c, and d on one line.

Example

Input

2
3
35


Output

10

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, and a, b, c, d are non-negative integers such that a + b + c + d = n, with each of a, b, c, and d in the range 0 to 1000. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.
def func_1():
    ans = [0] * 4001
    for line in stdin:
        n = int(line)
        
        if not ans[n]:
            count = 0
            for a in xrange((n if n < 1000 else 1000) + 1):
                e1 = n - a - 1001 if n - a - 1001 >= 0 else -1
                for nab in xrange(n - a, e1, -1):
                    ran = (nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000
                         else -1)
                    if ran >= 0:
                        count += ran
            ans[n] = count
        
        print(ans[n])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are non-negative integers such that `a + b + c + d = n`; `ans[n]` contains the total count of valid combinations calculated during all iterations; `count` is the total calculated based on the iterations for the final value of `n`; `e1` is either `n - 1001` or -1 depending on the value of `a`; `ans` is a list where `ans[i]` holds the calculated count for each integer `i` from 0 to 4000.
    exit()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of positive integers `n` (up to 4000) from standard input and calculates the number of valid combinations of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a + b + c + d = n`, with each variable being in the range of 0 to 1000. It stores these counts in an array `ans`, where `ans[n]` holds the count for the corresponding `n`. The function does not directly accept parameters and will continue processing until all datasets are consumed, with a maximum of 50 datasets. If `n` is less than or equal to 4000, it computes and prints the number of valid combinations for each `n` read from input. The function also includes logic to handle cases where the counts may depend on previously computed values in `ans` to avoid redundant calculations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
