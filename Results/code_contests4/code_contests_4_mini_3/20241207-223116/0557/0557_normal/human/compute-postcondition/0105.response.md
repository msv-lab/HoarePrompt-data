The value of `ran` is either `nab` or `1001 - nab` depending on the value of `nab`. The variable `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`, which means that `count` will now be either increased by `nab` (if `nab < 1000`) or by `1001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`). The values of `n`, `a`, and `e1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `e1` remain unchanged; `count` is increased by `ran` which is either `nab` (if `nab < 1000`) or `1001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`).

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `e1` remain unchanged; `count` is increased by `ran` which is either `nab` (if `nab < 1000`) or `1001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`)**.
