To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet provided.

1. The variable `ran` depends on the value of `n`:
   - If `n < 1001`, then `ran` is equal to `n`.
   - If `n >= 1001`, then `ran` is equal to `1002 - n`.

2. The code `count += ran` increments the value of `count` by the current value of `ran`.

3. The values of `n`, `nab`, and `ran` are as follows:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `nab` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - Depending on the value of `n`, `ran` could either be `n` (if `n < 1001`) or `1002 - n` (if `n >= 1001`).

Since the actual value of `n` is not specified, we cannot calculate a specific value for `ran` or `count`. Therefore, we can only describe the possible scenarios based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `nab` is `n - 1`; `ran` is either `n` (if `n < 1001`) or `1002 - n` (if `n >= 1001); `count` is increased by `ran`.**
