In the provided code snippet, `e1` is assigned the value of `n - a - 1001` if this expression is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, it is assigned the value -1. Given that `a` is 0, we can simplify the expression to `e1 = n - 1001` if `n - 1001 >= 0`, which means `n` must be at least 1001 for `e1` to be non-negative. If `n` is less than 1001, `e1` will be assigned -1.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is 0.

Therefore, the value of `e1` will be either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or -1 (if `n < 1001`).

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `count` is 0; `a` is 0; `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or -1 (if `n < 1001)**.
