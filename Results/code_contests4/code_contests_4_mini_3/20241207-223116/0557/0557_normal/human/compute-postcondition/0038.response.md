The expression `e1 = n - a - 1001 if n - a - 1001 >= 0 else -1` assigns a value to `e1` based on the condition of the expression `n - a - 1001`. 

To determine the output state:
- If `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0, then `e1` will be assigned the value of `n - a - 1001`.
- If `n - a - 1001` is less than 0, then `e1` will be assigned the value -1.

Given the initial state, we know that:
- For the loop to execute a second time, `a` must be `k + 1`. 
- If `n < 1000`, then `n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`.
- If `n >= 1000`, then `a` must be less than `1000`.

Since we do not have specific values for `n` and `a`, we can only describe the conditional result based on the stated conditions.

The output state can be expressed as follows:

Output State: **`e1` is either `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001 >= 0`, or `e1` is -1 if `n - a - 1001 < 0`**
