To determine the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze what happens step by step based on the initial state.

1. The variable `e1` is assigned a value based on a conditional expression. 
2. The expression checks if `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0. Here, `a` is given as 1.
3. Thus, the expression simplifies to checking if `n - 1 - 1001 >= 0`, which is equivalent to checking if `n >= 1002`.
4. If this condition is true, `e1` will be assigned the value `n - 1 - 1001`. 
5. If the condition is false (i.e., `n < 1002`), then `e1` will be assigned the value `-1`.

Next, based on the value of `n` (which is a non-negative integer), we can summarize the possible outcomes:

- If `n >= 1002`, then `e1 = n - 1002`.
- If `n < 1002`, then `e1 = -1`.

The other variables (`count`, `ran`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state can be articulated as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `count` is the total calculated based on the iterations; `a` is 1; `ran` is either `2001 - n` (if `n >= 1001`) or `n + 1` (if `n < 1001); `e1` is either `n - 1002` (if `n >= 1002`) or `-1` (if `n < 1002)`**.
