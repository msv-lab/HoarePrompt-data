The value of `count` is incremented by `ran`. The value of `ran` depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1001, then `ran` is equal to `2001 - n`. If `n` is less than 1001, then `ran` is equal to `n + 1`. Since `ran` is guaranteed to be non-negative, `count` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `count` is either `ran` (if `n >= 1001`) or `ran + 0` (if `n < 1001`); `a` is 0; `ran` is either `2001 - n` or `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `count` is either `ran` (if `n >= 1001`) or `ran + 0` (if `n < 1001`); `a` is 0; `ran` is either `2001 - n` or `n + 1`.**
