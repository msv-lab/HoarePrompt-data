The expression `e1` is assigned a value based on the calculation of `n - a - 1001`. The variable `a` is given as 2. Thus, the calculation can be framed as `e1 = n - 2 - 1001`. If this result is greater than or equal to 0, `e1` will take that value; otherwise, it will be assigned -1. 

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the possible outcomes for `e1` depend on the value of `n`:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1003 (since `1003 = 2 + 1001`), `e1` will be -1.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 1004, `e1` will be `n - 1003`.

Other variables such as `count` and `ran` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`count` is the total accumulated value from the loop iterations, `ran` is derived from the last value of `nab`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is 2, and `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1003` depending on the specific value of `n`.

Output State: **`count` is the total accumulated value from the loop iterations, `ran` is derived from the last value of `nab`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is 2, and `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1003`**.
