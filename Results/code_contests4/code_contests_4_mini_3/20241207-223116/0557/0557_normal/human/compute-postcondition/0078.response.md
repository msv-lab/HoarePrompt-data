To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we first analyze the for loop definition:

```
for nab in xrange(n - a, e1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as the starting value (which is `n - a`) is greater than the ending value (`e1`), given that the step is negative (`-1`). 

Now, let's break down the components:

1. **Starting Value:** `n - a` is the starting point of the loop. Since `a` is given as 1, the starting value simplifies to `n - 1`.
2. **Ending Value:** The ending value `e1` is determined by the value of `n`:
   - If `n >= 1002`, then `e1 = n - 1002`.
   - If `n < 1002`, then `e1 = -1`.

**Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
- If `n >= 1002`, for the loop to execute, we need:
  - `n - 1 > n - 1002` which simplifies to `n > 1001`. This condition is always true if `n >= 1002`.
  
- If `n < 1002`, for the loop to execute, we need:
  - `n - 1 > -1` which simplifies to `n > 0`.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute:
- If `n >= 1002`, it is sufficient to have `n` be at least 1002.
- If `n < 1002`, then `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final State:**
To summarize the conditions, we can denote the states as follows:

- For the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and the starting value `nab` will be `n - 1`. 
- If `n >= 1002`, then `e1` would be `n - 1002`.

Therefore, we can conclude:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `count` is the total calculated based on the iterations, `a` is 1, `ran` is either `2001 - n` (if `n >= 1001`) or `n + 1` (if `n < 1001); `e1` is either `n - 1002` (if `n >= 1002`) or `-1` (if `n < 1002), nab is `n - 1`**
