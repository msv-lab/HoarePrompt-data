The code creates a list `ans` with 4001 elements, all initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, which remain as described in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable created and its status.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are non-negative integers such that a + b + c + d = n; `ans` is a list of 4001 zeros.**
