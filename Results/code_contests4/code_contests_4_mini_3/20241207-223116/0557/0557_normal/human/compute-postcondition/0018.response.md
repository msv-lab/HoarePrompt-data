To determine the output state, we need to analyze how the provided code snippet impacts the existing variables:

1. We know that `ran` can take different values based on `nab`:
   - If `nab < 1000`, then `ran = nab + 1`.
   - If `nab == 1000`, then `ran = 999`.
   - If `nab > 1000`, then `ran = 1001 - nab`.

2. The code `count += ran` means that the value of `ran` will be added to `count`, but we need to know what `ran` is based on the value of `nab`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer ≤ 4000.
- `nab` is `e1 + 1`.
- The value of `ran` varies depending on `nab`.

Since the exact value of `nab` or `ran` is not given, we can only describe the possible outcomes for `ran` based on the constraints of `nab`.

Thus, we cannot directly calculate the final value of `count` without knowing its initial value, but we can describe the possible changes:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer ≤ 4000; `nab` is `e1 + 1`; `ran` is either `nab + 1`, `999`, or `1001 - nab` depending on the value of `nab`; `count` is increased by `ran`.**
