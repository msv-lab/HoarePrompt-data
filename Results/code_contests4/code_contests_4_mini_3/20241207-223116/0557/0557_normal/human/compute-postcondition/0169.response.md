The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it works with the constraints provided for the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The function is designed to handle datasets, where `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, and `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that their sum equals `n`, with each of them ranging from 0 to 1000. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

Since the output behavior is not explicitly defined in the provided information, we are unable to detail specific return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly and operates on datasets with constraints on integers n, a, b, c, and d. It validates that a + b + c + d equals n, with n being a positive integer up to 4000 and each of a, b, c, and d being non-negative integers in the range of 0 to 1000. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.**
