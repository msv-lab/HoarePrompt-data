The value of `e1` is assigned based on the calculation `n - a - 1001`. Since `a` is 0, the expression simplifies to `n - 1001`. The conditional checks if `n - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0. 

- If `n` is greater than or equal to 1001, then `e1` will be `n - 1001`.
- If `n` is less than 1001, then `e1` will be `-1`.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the possible values for `e1` depend on `n`'s value in relation to 1001. The states of the other variables (`count` and `a`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `count` is 0; `a` is 0; `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or `-1` (if `n < 1001`).

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `count` is 0; `a` is 0; `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or `-1` (if `n < 1001)**
