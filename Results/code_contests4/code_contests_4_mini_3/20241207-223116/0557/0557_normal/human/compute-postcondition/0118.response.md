To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code on the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer. Based on the value of `n`, the code will set the values of `nab` and `e1`.
2. If `n >= 1001`, then `nab` is assigned the value of `n` and `e1` is assigned `n - 1001`.
3. If `n < 1001`, then `nab` is assigned the value of `n` and `e1` is assigned `-1`.
4. The line of code calculates `ran` using the value of `nab`. The calculation checks if `nab` is less than 1000 or greater than 1000 and assigns a value accordingly.
5. Specifically:
   - If `nab < 1000`, `ran` is calculated as `nab - (-1)` which simplifies to `nab + 1`.
   - If `nab >= 1000`, `ran` is calculated as `1000 - (nab - 1001)` which simplifies to `2001 - nab`.

Depending on whether `n` is greater than or equal to 1001 or less than 1001, the calculations for `ran` will differ.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't provide a numerical output for `ran`, but we can express its potential outcomes based on the conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `nab` is either `n` or `n`, and `e1` is either `n - 1001` or `-1`; `ran` is either `nab + 1` or `2001 - nab`.**
