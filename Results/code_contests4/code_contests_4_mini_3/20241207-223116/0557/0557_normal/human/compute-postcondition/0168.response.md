Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are non-negative integers such that `a + b + c + d = n`; `ans[n]` contains the total count of valid combinations calculated during all iterations; `count` is the total calculated based on the iterations for the final value of `n`; `e1` is either `n - 1001` or -1 depending on the value of `a`; `ans` is a list where `ans[i]` holds the calculated count for each integer `i` from 0 to 4000 and the program exits without further execution.**
