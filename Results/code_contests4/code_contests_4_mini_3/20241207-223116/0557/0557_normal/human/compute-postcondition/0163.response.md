Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the sum of all non-negative `ran` values calculated during the iterations, `a` is 1000 or less (up to `n`), `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or `-1` (if `n < 1001). `ran` is either 0 or a positive integer, depending on the values of `nab` during the iterations. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0.**
