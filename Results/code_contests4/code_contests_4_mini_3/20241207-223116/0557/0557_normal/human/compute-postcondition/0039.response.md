According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `e1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value `n - a` must be greater than `e1`. 

1. If `n - a - 1001 >= 0`, then `e1` is `n - a - 1001`. In this case, the loop will execute if `n - a` is greater than `n - a - 1001`, which is always true since `n - a` is at least 0 (because `e1` would not be -1).
2. If `n - a - 1001 < 0`, then `e1` is -1. The loop will execute if `n - a` is greater than -1, which is true if `n - a` is at least 0.

Thus, in both scenarios, for the loop to execute, `n - a` must be at least 0. Additionally, `nab` will start at `n - a`.

State: **`e1` is either `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001 >= 0`, or `-1` if `n - a - 1001 < 0`, for the loop to execute the first time `nab` is `n - a` and `n - a` is greater than `e1`**
