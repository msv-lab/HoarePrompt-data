According to the code, the loop iterates through values of `nab` starting from `n - a` and ending at `e1`, decrementing by 1 each time. The loop will execute as long as `nab` is greater than or equal to `e1`. At the end of the last iteration, `nab` is equal to some value that is one less than its previous value. 

To determine the states at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `nab`. If `nab` was `e1 + 1` at the end of the last iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `nab` must be `e1` in the next iteration. 

Additionally, since `nab` is defined as `n - 1`, the loop's execution is also dependent on `n` remaining constant, and `a` and `e1` must allow for `nab` to be valid in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `nab` is `e1`, for the loop to execute one more time `nab` must be greater than or equal to `e1` and `n - a` must be greater than or equal to `e1`.**
