Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the sum of all ran values calculated during the iterations of the loop, `a` is 0, `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or `-1` (if `n < 1001). `ran` is either 0 or a positive integer, depending on the value of `nab` during the iterations. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0.**
