Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `nab` is either `n` or `n`, `e1` is either `n - 1001` or `-1`, and `ran` is either `nab + 1` or `2001 - nab`. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is increased by `ran`, where `ran` could be either `n + 1` or `2001 - n`. If `ran` is less than 0, no changes are made to `count`.***
