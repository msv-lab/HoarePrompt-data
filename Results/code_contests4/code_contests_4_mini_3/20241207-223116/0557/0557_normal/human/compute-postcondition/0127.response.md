To evaluate the given code snippet, we analyze the expression step by step:

1. The variable `ran` is calculated based on the value of `nab`.
2. If `nab` is less than 1000, `ran` will be assigned the value of `nab`.
3. If `nab` is 1000 or greater, `ran` will be assigned the value `1000`.
4. The second part of the expression `(nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1)` will determine how much to subtract from the first part of the expression.
5. If `nab` is greater than 1000, we subtract `nab - 1001`, which simplifies to `1001 - nab` when we consider the total expression.
6. If `nab` is less than or equal to 1000, we subtract `-1`, which effectively adds 1 to the first part of the expression.

Given that `nab` is initialized as `e1`, we can conclude the following based on the conditions provided:

- If `nab < 1000`: `ran = nab - (-1)`, resulting in `ran = nab + 1`.
- If `nab >= 1000`: `ran = 1000 - (nab - 1001)`, which simplifies to `ran = 1001 - nab`.

Since `nab` is `e1`, we do not have a specific numeric value for it, so the output will reflect the dependency on `e1`.

Thus, the output state will be:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `nab` is `e1`, `ran` is either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`) or `1001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`).**
