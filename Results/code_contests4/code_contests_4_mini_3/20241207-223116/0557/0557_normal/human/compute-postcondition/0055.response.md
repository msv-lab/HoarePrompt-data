Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are non-negative integers such that `a + b + c + d = n`. If `ans[n]` is not previously assigned, `count` accumulates the value from all iterations based on the calculations of `ran`, `e1` is assigned either `n - 1001` or -1 depending on the final value of `a`, and `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`.***
