To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet on the current state of the variables.

1. The variable `ran` is defined based on the value of `nab`:
   - If `nab < 1000`, then `ran = nab + 1`.
   - If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran = 1001 - nab`.

2. The code `count += ran` indicates that the value of `ran` will be added to `count`.

Since `n` and `nab` are provided, we will focus on how they interact with `ran` and `count`. However, we do not have a specific value for `count` in the current state, so we will note that it is incremented by the value of `ran`.

The output will summarize the states of the affected variables, considering their relationships.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `nab` is `e1`, `ran` is either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`) or `1001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`), and `count` is increased by `ran`.**
