To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the relationship between `ran` and `nab` based on the provided information. 

1. If `nab < 1000`, then `ran = nab + 1001`.
2. If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran = 2001 - nab`.

Next, the code snippet `count += ran` indicates that `count` will be increased by the value of `ran`.

However, since we don't have a specific value for `nab`, we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for `ran`, and consequently for `count`. Instead, we will express the output state in terms of the possible values of `ran`.

- If `nab < 1000`, then `ran = nab + 1001`, so `count` is incremented by `nab + 1001`.
- If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran = 2001 - nab`, so `count` is incremented by `2001 - nab`.

Thus, the output state will reflect both scenarios.

Output State: **`nab` is a variable, `ran` is either `nab + 1001` (if `nab < 1000`) or `2001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`); `count` is increased by `ran`.**
