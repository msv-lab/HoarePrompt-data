Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are non-negative integers such that `a + b + c + d = n`; if `ans[n]` is not previously assigned, `count` accumulates the value from all iterations based on the calculations of `ran`; `e1` is assigned either `n - 1001` or -1 depending on the final value of `a`; `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`; the value of `ans[n]` is printed.**
