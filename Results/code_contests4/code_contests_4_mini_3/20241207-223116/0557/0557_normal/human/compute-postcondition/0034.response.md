To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, we analyze the impact of the statement `count += ran`. 

- The variable `count` is an accumulated value from all previous iterations, which means it holds a certain numeric value.
- The variable `ran` can either be `e1 + 1` if `e1 < 1000` or `2001 - e1` if `e1 >= 1000`. 
- The variable `nab` is equal to `e1`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `nab` must be greater than `e1`. This indicates that `nab` is not being updated in this iteration but rather provides a comparison condition for further iterations.

Given this, `count` will be updated to include the value of `ran`, but we do not have specific values for `count`, `ran`, or `e1` provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `count` based on the addition of `ran`.

Output State: **`count` is updated by adding `ran` to it.**
