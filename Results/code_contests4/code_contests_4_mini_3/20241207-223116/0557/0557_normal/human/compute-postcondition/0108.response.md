Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the total calculated based on the iterations (either `1001 * (2001 - n)` if `n >= 1001` or `(n + 1) * (n + 1)` if `n < 1001), `a` is at least 0 and at most 1000, `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1001`, and `ran` is derived from the last valid value of `nab` based on the conditions defined in the loop.**
