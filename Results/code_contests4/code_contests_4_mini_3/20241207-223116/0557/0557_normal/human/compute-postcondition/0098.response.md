Postcondition: ***`count` is updated by adding `ran`, resulting in a new value of `count + ran`, where `ran` is either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`) or `1001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`), and the values of `n`, `a`, `e1`, and `nab` remain unchanged, with `n` being at least 2, `a` being 2, `e1` being either -1 or `n - 1003`, and `nab` being `n - 2`.***
