The variable `count` is assigned the value 0, which resets its previous value. The other variables `n`, `a`, `e1`, and `ans[n]` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0, `a` is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1001`, and `ans[n]` is either `count` or previously assigned value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0, `a` is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1001`, and `ans[n]` is either `count` or previously assigned value.**
