To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the impact of the code snippet provided.

1. **Understanding Variables:**
   - `e1` is either `n - a - 1001` (if `n - a - 1001 >= 0`) or `-1` (if `n - a - 1001 < 0`).
   - `nab` is defined as `n - a`.
   - The loop executes the first time if `nab` (which is `n - a`) is greater than `e1`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   The code calculates `ran` based on the value of `nab`:
   - If `nab < 1000`, then `ran = nab - (nab - 1001)`, which simplifies to `ran = 1001`.
   - If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran = 1000 - (nab - 1001)`, which simplifies to `ran = 2001 - nab`.

3. **Calculating `ran`:**
   - If `nab < 1000`: 
     - `ran` will be `1001`.
   - If `nab >= 1000`: 
     - `ran` will be calculated as `2001 - nab`.

4. **Considering `e1`:**
   Since `e1` is calculated based on the relationship with `n` and `a`, the values of `nab` and `e1` will affect the output state. However, since we do not have specific values for `n` and `a`, we will express the output state in terms of these variables.

Thus, the output state will reflect the possible values of `ran` based on the conditions involving `nab`:

Output State: **`e1` is either `n - a - 1001` or `-1`; `ran` is either `1001` if `nab < 1000` or `2001 - nab` if `nab >= 1000`.**
