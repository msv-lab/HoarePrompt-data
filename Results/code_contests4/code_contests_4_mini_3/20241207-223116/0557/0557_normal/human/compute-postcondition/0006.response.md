To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet. 

- `e1` is assigned the value of `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, it is assigned -1.
- Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, and `a` is 0.

Now we can substitute `a` into the expression:

1. Calculate `n - a - 1001`:
   - Since `a` is 0, this simplifies to `n - 1001`.

2. We need to check if `n - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 1001 (which it can be since `n` is a positive integer up to 4000), then `e1` will be `n - 1001`.
   - If `n` is less than 1001, then `e1` will be -1.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `n`:

- If `n >= 1001`, then `e1 = n - 1001`.
- If `n < 1001`, then `e1 = -1`.

Since `n` is not specified beyond the condition, we can express the output state as:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or -1 (if `n < 1001)**.
