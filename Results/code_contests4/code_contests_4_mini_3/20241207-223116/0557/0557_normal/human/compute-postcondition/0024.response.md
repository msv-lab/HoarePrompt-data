To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state:

1. The variable `ran` is assigned a value based on the expression:
   - If `nab < 1000`, `ran` is assigned the value of `nab`.
   - If `nab >= 1000`, `ran` is assigned the value of 1000 minus `(nab - 1001)`, which simplifies to `1001 - nab` when `nab > 1000`. 
   - If `nab == 1000`, `ran` becomes `1000 - (-1)`, which equals `1001`.

2. The value of `count` is not changed directly by this line of code, as it only assigns a new value to `ran`.

3. The value of `e1` is also not influenced by this line of code, remaining as either -1 or `n - 2002` depending on the value of `n`.

Since we don't have specific values for `nab`, `count`, or `n`, we can only describe the potential outcomes based on the conditions laid out.

Output State: **`count` is the accumulated value from all iterations; `e1` is either -1 (if `n < 2002`) or `n - 2002` (if `n >= 2002`); `ran` is determined based on the value of `nab` with specific conditions.**
