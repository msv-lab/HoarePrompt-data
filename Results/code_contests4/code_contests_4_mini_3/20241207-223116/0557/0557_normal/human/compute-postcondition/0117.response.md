To determine the conditions for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the parameters involved:

1. The loop is structured as `for nab in xrange(n - a, e1, -1)`. 
2. The start of the loop is `n - a`. Given that `a` is 0, the starting point is `n - 0`, which simplifies to `n`.
3. The end of the loop is `e1`, which depends on the value of `n`:
   - If `n >= 1001`, then `e1` is `n - 1001`.
   - If `n < 1001`, then `e1` is `-1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the starting point must be greater than the ending point. Therefore, we analyze both cases for `n`.

**Case 1: If `n >= 1001`**
- Starting point: `n`
- Ending point: `n - 1001`
- For the loop to execute: `n > n - 1001`, which simplifies to `1001 > 0` (always true).

**Case 2: If `n < 1001`**
- Starting point: `n`
- Ending point: `-1`
- For the loop to execute: `n > -1` (this is true for all non-negative integers, including 0).

**Conclusion:**
In both cases, for the loop to execute:
- `n` must be a non-negative integer (which is already given).
- In case of `n >= 1001`, the starting point is `n` and the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than `n - 1001`.
- In case of `n < 1001`, the starting point is `n` and the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than `-1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time:
1. If `n >= 1001`, the values are `n` is at least 1001, starting from `n` and ending at `n - 1001`.
2. If `n < 1001`, the values are `n` is any non-negative integer less than 1001, starting from `n` and ending at `-1`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0, `a` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time, if `n >= 1001`, then `nab` starts at `n` and `e1` is `n - 1001`; if `n < 1001`, `nab` starts at `n` and `e1` is `-1`.**
