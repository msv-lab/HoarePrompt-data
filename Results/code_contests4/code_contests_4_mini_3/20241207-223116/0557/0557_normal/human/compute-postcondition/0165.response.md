Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `ans[n]` is not assigned a value (i.e., it is falsy), then `count` is the sum of all non-negative `ran` values calculated during the iterations, `a` is 1000 or less (up to `n`), and `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or `-1` (if `n < 1001); `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`.***
