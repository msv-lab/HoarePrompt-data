The function processes a list of positive integers `n` (up to 4000) from standard input and calculates the number of valid combinations of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a + b + c + d = n`, with each variable being in the range of 0 to 1000. It stores these counts in an array `ans`, where `ans[n]` holds the count for the corresponding `n`. The function does not directly accept parameters and will continue processing until all datasets are consumed, with a maximum of 50 datasets. If `n` is less than or equal to 4000, it computes and prints the number of valid combinations for each `n` read from input. The function also includes logic to handle cases where the counts may depend on previously computed values in `ans` to avoid redundant calculations.
