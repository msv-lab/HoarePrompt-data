To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that it correctly calculates the number of combinations of four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) that sum up to \(n\), where each integer is between 0 and 1000, for multiple datasets of \(n\) up to 4000.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple values of \(n\) until the end of input. This is acceptable based on the problem description.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program initializes an answer list `ans` for storing results for each \(n\) from 0 to 4000.
   - It checks if combinations for the specific \(n\) have already been calculated (`if not ans[n]`).
   - The outer loop iterates \(a\) from 0 to the minimum of \(n\) or 1000.
   - The nested loop attempts to calculate possible values for \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) based on the remaining value after choosing \(a\).

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The use of `xrange` indicates this code might be intended for Python 2. If this is run in a Python 3 environment, `xrange` will throw an error since `xrange` does not exist in Python 3.
   - The logic to calculate the range for \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) is complex and might not cover all combinations correctly. Specifically, the calculation of `e1` and the nested loop might not correctly account for all valid combinations where \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are also constrained between 0 and 1000.

### Test Case:
To find a potential case where the program does not work correctly, consider the input \(n = 3\):
- Combinations satisfying \(a + b + c + d = 3\) include:
  - \(0 + 0 + 0 + 3\)
  - \(0 + 0 + 1 + 2\)
  - \(0 + 0 + 2 + 1\)
  - \(0 + 0 + 3 + 0\)
  - \(0 + 1 + 1 + 1\)
  - \(1 + 0 + 1 + 1\)
  - \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0\)
  - \(1 + 2 + 0 + 0\)
  - \(2 + 1 + 0 + 0\)
  - \(3 + 0 + 0 + 0\)

However, the program's logic may fail to account for all possible combinations correctly due to the way it calculates `e1` and the nested loop bounds.

### Conclusion:
Since the program potentially does not enumerate all valid combinations especially when \(n\) is small or when \(a + b + c + d\) can yield combinations that are not covered by the algorithm, this indicates an issue.

Correctness: **False**.
