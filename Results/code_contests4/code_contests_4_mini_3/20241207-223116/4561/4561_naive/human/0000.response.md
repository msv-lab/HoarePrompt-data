To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the program and how it addresses all specified cases in the problem.

The problem requires handling activation and deactivation of colliders, ensuring that:
1. A collider can be activated only if it is not already activated.
2. A collider can only be activated if it is pairwise relatively prime to all currently activated colliders.
3. Deactivation should correctly acknowledge whether a collider is already off or successfully turn it off.

Now, let's assess the provided program:

1. **Initialization and Prime Factorization**:
   - The program initializes an array `prim` to store the smallest prime factor for numbers from 1 to `Max`. 
   - It uses `func_1` to populate this array.
   - `func_2` is used to retrieve the prime factors of a given number, which is crucial for checking relative primality.

2. **Processing Requests**:
   - The program processes each request and correctly distinguishes between activation (`+ i`) and deactivation (`- i`) requests.
   - For activation requests, it checks if the collider is already on. If it is, it responds with "Already on".
   - If the collider is not already on, it checks its prime factors against the currently activated colliders stored in `mem`. If any collider with a non-prime relationship is found, it responds with "Conflict with j", where `j` is the conflicting collider.
   - For deactivation requests, it checks if the collider is already off. If it is, it responds with "Already off". If it is currently on, it successfully deactivates it.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases for the collider numbered `1` explicitly, which is important as it can lead to conflicts with other colliders if activated.
   - It also ensures that it does not allow multiple entries in the memory for the same collider, which could lead to erroneous responses.

After analyzing the program, it appears to handle the requirements of the problem effectively. The logic for checking relative primality via prime factorization seems sound, and the response outputs match the expected results for activation and deactivation requests.

### Test Cases
Given the nature of the problem, one potential edge case could be how the program handles the situation when all colliders are activated and then an additional activation request for a collider that is not relatively prime to any of the activated colliders is received. 

However, I have not found any logical flaws or missed edge cases in the implementation based on the provided problem description and the logic in the code.

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the required functionality and handles edge cases as specified in the problem description.
