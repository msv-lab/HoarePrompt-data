Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the requirement of ensuring that all activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the program uses a set to store activated colliders by their prime factors, which can lead to incorrect behavior when dealing with multiple colliders that share prime factors.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 3
+ 4
+ 2
+ 6
```

In this case:
1. The request `+ 4` should be successful because no colliders are activated. The output will be "Success".
2. The request `+ 2` should also be successful because 2 and 4 are not relatively prime (GCD(2, 4) = 2), but since 4 was just activated, it should conflict with 4. The output should be "Conflict with 4".
3. The request `+ 6` should also conflict with both 2 and 4 (GCD(6, 2) = 2 and GCD(6, 4) = 2), but the program might not properly identify that there is a conflict with both.

However, the program incorrectly allows the activation of colliders based on their prime factors without considering that multiple colliders can activate and conflict with each other. Hence, the program fails to ensure that all activated colliders remain pairwise relatively prime, which violates the problem description.

Thus, the program is not correct based on the requirements given in the problem description.
