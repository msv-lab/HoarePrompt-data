The function accepts a tuple `x` where the first element is a positive integer and returns a list of its prime factors in the order they were discovered. The function does not process the second part of the tuple which includes requests, hence it only focuses on factoring the first integer. If the input integer is 1 or less, it will return an empty list since there are no prime factors for such values.
