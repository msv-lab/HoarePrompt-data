Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it lacks the implementation for handling the activation and deactivation of the colliders as specified. The function `func_1` initializes a list of smallest prime factors but does not process any requests or maintain the state of the colliders. Similarly, `func_2` focuses solely on factoring numbers and does not address the requests for activating or deactivating colliders.

Here are some specific issues:

1. **Request Handling**: The problem requires that for each "+ i" request, the program should check if the collider is already on, or if activating it would conflict with any already activated colliders. The provided code does not contain any logic to process these requests.

2. **State Management**: There is no mechanism in place to track which colliders are currently activated or deactivated, which is essential for determining conflicts and successful activations/deactivations.

3. **Output Generation**: The program does not print any output as required by the problem description. 

As a result, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, thus leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
