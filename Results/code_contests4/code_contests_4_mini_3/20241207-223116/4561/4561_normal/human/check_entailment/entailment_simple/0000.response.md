Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem description. Here are the key reasons why it fails to meet the specifications:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**: The problem description requires a mechanism to activate and deactivate colliders while managing conflicts based on whether the numbers associated with activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime. The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not cater to this requirement at all. They are focused on calculating prime factors but do not handle the activation/deactivation logic or the checking of conflicts as specified.

2. **Lack of State Management**: The description requires tracking the state of each collider (whether it is activated or deactivated) and ensuring that activations are successful only if there is no conflict with already activated colliders. The functions provided do not manage or maintain the state of the colliders in any form.

3. **No Input/Output Handling**: The program does not handle input or output as specified in the problem description. There is no main control structure that processes requests, generates appropriate responses, or maintains a record of activated colliders.

4. **Prime Factorization is Insufficient**: While the program calculates prime factors, this information alone does not help in determining whether the activation of a collider is safe or conflicts with others. The problem requires checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) between numbers, not simply their prime factors.

Overall, the program lacks a comprehensive structure to fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which necessitates both state management for colliders and conflict resolution based on relative primality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
