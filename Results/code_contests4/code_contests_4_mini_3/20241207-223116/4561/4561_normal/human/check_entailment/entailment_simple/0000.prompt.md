You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: By 2312 there were n Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to n. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.

In 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.

Upon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).

Initially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form "activate/deactivate the i-th collider". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.

To the request of "+ i" (that is, to activate the i-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: 

  * "Success" if the activation was successful. 
  * "Already on", if the i-th collider was already activated before the request. 
  * "Conflict with j", if there is a conflict with the j-th collider (that is, the j-th collider is on, and numbers i and j are not relatively prime). In this case, the i-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. 



The request of "- i" (that is, to deactivate the i-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: 

  * "Success", if the deactivation was successful. 
  * "Already off", if the i-th collider was already deactivated before the request. 



You don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) — the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.

Next m lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either "+ i" (without the quotes) — activate the i-th collider, or "- i" (without the quotes) — deactivate the i-th collider (1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Print m lines — the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input. Don't forget that the responses to the requests should be printed without quotes.

Examples

Input

10 10
+ 6
+ 10
+ 5
- 10
- 5
- 6
+ 10
+ 3
+ 6
+ 3


Output

Success
Conflict with 6
Success
Already off
Success
Success
Success
Success
Conflict with 10
Already on

Note

Note that in the sample the colliders don't turn on after the second and ninth requests. The ninth request could also receive response "Conflict with 3".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of colliders, and m is a positive integer representing the number of requests, where each request is in the form of "+ i" or "- i" and 1 <= i <= n.
def func_1(n):
    prim[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        if not prim[i]:
            for j in range(i, n, i):
                prim[j] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer, `prim[i]` is the smallest prime number that divides `i` for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, and `prim[1]` is 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer n (the number of colliders) and the second element is a positive integer m (the number of requests), followed by m strings representing the requests in the form of either "+ i" or "- i" (1 ≤ i ≤ n).
def func_2(x):
    fac = []
    while x > 1:
        div = prim[x]
        
        fac.append(div)
        
        while x % div == 0:
            x //= div
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a tuple where the first element is reduced to a value that is not divisible by any remaining elements in `prim`, `fac` contains all the prime factors of the original first element of `x` in the order they were found, and `x` has been fully factored.
    return fac
    #The program returns the list of prime factors 'fac' of the original first element of the tuple 'x', in the order they were found.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
