Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is no longer divisible by `div` (meaning it's not a multiple of `div`), and `fac` includes the value of `div` raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed. If the initial first element of `x` was a power of `div`, then it would become 1; otherwise, it will be a reduced value greater than 1.**
