According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x % div == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must still be divisible by `div`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is updated to `x // div`, which reduces `x`. The first element of `x` must be greater than `div * div` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since the first element of `x` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute again, the condition must be that after the update `x // div` still results in a value that is divisible by `div`. This means that before the update, the first element of `x` must have been at least `div * div`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the first element of `x` is greater than `div * div` before the update.

State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is greater than 1 and for the loop to execute again the first element of `x` must be greater than `div * div`**
