The operation `x //= div` performs an integer division of `x` by `div` and assigns the result back to `x`. Since `x` is a tuple, applying `//=` directly on a tuple will raise an error in Python. Therefore, we cannot change `x` directly using this operation without first converting it.

However, since `x` is described as a tuple where the first element is 2 or more and is a multiple of `div`, the operation would conceptually affect the first element of the tuple if we were to perform integer division on it.

Thus, after applying the operation, we can determine that the first element of `x`, which we'll denote as `x[0]`, is divided by `div`. The result will yield a new value for `x[0]`.

Since the exact values of `div` and the first element of `x` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact new value of `x[0]` but can say it will be some integer resulting from the division.

Output State: **`fac` contains `div`, `x` is a tuple where the first element is the result of integer division of its original value by `div`, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged.**
