According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and its relationship with `div`. The expression `x % div == 0` checks if `x` is divisible by `div`. 

Right before the loop, `x` is a tuple where the first element is 2 or more and the second element is a positive integer. Since the modulo operation is typically performed on a single integer, we need to clarify which element of the tuple `x` is being used in the condition.

Assuming that we are using the first element of the tuple `x` (which is 2 or more) for the modulo operation, the first element must also be divisible by `div` for the loop to execute. Since `div` is contained in `fac`, we need to ensure that the first element of `x` is greater than or equal to `div` and that it is a multiple of `div`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we can adjust the states to ensure that the first element of `x` is such that it is a multiple of `div`.

State: **`fac` contains `div`, `x` is a tuple where the first element is 2 or more and is a multiple of `div`**.
