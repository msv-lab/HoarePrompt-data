The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a positive integer `n` (the number of colliders), and the second element is a positive integer `m` (the number of requests), followed by `m` strings that represent the requests in the form of either "+ i" or "- i" (where 1 ≤ i ≤ n). After executing the function body, it returns a list of prime factors `fac` of the original first element of the tuple `x`, in the order they were found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `x` containing two positive integers followed by request strings, and returns a list of prime factors of the first element of the tuple in the order they were found.**
