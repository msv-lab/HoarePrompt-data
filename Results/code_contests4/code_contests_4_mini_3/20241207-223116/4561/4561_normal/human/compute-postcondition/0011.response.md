According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. The loop will continue as long as `x` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a tuple where the first element is no longer divisible by `div`, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. This means that the first element of `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

Since `x` is a tuple and its first element is no longer divisible by `div`, the first element must be at least 2 (to ensure it's greater than 1). Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the first element of `x` is greater than 1.

State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is greater than 1, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged; `fac` contains `div`.**
