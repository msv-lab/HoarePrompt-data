The variable `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, and then this value is appended to the list `fac`. Since `fac` starts as an empty list, after appending `div`, `fac` will contain one element which is the value of `div`. The values of `x` and `prim[x]` do not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`fac` contains `div`, `x` is a tuple where the first element is 2 or more and the second element is a positive integer**
