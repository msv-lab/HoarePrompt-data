In this case, `fac` is initialized as an empty list. The initial values of the tuple `x` (which contains `n`, `m`, and the requests) are not directly affected by the line of code provided. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and no calculations or assignments occur based on the current line. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` is an empty list, and `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`fac` is an empty list, `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer n (the number of colliders) and the second element is a positive integer m (the number of requests), followed by m strings representing the requests in the form of either "+ i" or "- i".**
