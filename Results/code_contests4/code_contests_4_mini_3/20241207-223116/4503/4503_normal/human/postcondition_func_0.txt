The function accepts a list of strings `line`, an integer `end`, an integer `pos`, and an integer `left`. It returns the selected vertical line number `pos` incremented by 1 if certain conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns False if any of the following conditions are true: `left` is 0, `pos` is less than 1 or greater than or equal to `end`, or there are horizontal lines present at the specified positions in the `line` list where the selected vertical line cannot be hit.
