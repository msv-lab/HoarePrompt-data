The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Logic for Horizontal Lines**: The function `func_1` checks if a horizontal line can be drawn based on the current position and the presence of existing horizontal lines. However, the logic is flawed. The checks for whether a horizontal line can be drawn do not fully ensure that it adheres to the rules of the Amidakuji, particularly regarding whether adding a horizontal line would still allow for valid navigation in the game.

2. **Hit Position Logic**: The logic for determining whether the hit position can be reached does not account for all possible configurations of horizontal lines. For example, if there are horizontal lines that would block the path to the hit position, the program does not correctly identify that the hit cannot be reached.

3. **Output Specification**: The output specification states that if the hit can be reached without drawing a line, it should output `0`. If it can be reached with one line drawn, it should output the position of that line. If it cannot be reached even with a line, it should output `1`. The provided program does not clearly handle these outputs correctly based on the described conditions.

4. **Incomplete Functionality**: The program lacks comprehensive handling of cases where the horizontal lines may need to be added in different locations to allow for the hit position to be reached. The program should simulate all possible scenarios of adding a horizontal line and then check if the hit can be reached.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
