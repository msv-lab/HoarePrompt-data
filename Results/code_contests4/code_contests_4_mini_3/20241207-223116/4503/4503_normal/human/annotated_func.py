It returns the selected vertical line number `pos` incremented by 1 if certain conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns False if any of the following conditions are true: `left` is 0, `pos` is less than 1 or greater than or equal to `end`, or there are horizontal lines present at the specified positions in the `line` list where the selected vertical line cannot be hit.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a positive integer representing the selected vertical line (1 ≤ start ≤ n), side is a positive integer representing the hit place (1 ≤ side ≤ n), add is a non-negative integer representing the number of stages (1 ≤ add ≤ 30), and left is a list of strings of length n-1, where each string consists of '0's and '1's indicating the presence or absence of horizontal lines between the vertical lines. n is a positive integer (1 < n ≤ 10).

    return cross, pos + 1
    #The program returns the final result 'cross' from the last execution of 'func_1' and 'pos' incremented by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `start`, a list of strings `side`, a non-negative integer `add`, and a list of strings `left`. It processes these inputs to determine a position on a vertical line and potentially the result of a call to another function, `func_1`, based on the `add` value. It returns a tuple containing the result of `func_1` (or `False` if certain conditions are met) and the final position incremented by 1. If the `add` value does not match any step in the loop, the position may not be updated meaningfully, and the function could return values that indicate no valid crossing occurred.
