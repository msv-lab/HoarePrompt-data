`pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1`. Since `start` is a positive integer, `pos` will also be a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables (`side`, `add`, `left`, `end`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a non-negative integer, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, and `pos` is `start - 1`.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a non-negative integer, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 1`.**
