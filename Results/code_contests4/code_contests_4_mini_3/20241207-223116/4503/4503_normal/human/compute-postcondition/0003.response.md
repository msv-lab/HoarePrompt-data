The variable `cross` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1 (or remains the same if it was 0), `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 1, and `cross` is 0.
