According to the code, the loop execution depends on the `side` list and the `step` variable. The loop will execute while there are more elements in the `side` list to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `step` is `step + 1`, indicating that the loop has executed for `step` iterations. Since `side` has at least `step + 1` elements, it indicates there is at least one more element left to process.

Thus, when the loop executes for the next iteration, `step` will be incremented by 1, making it `step + 2`, and `line` will be the next element in the `side` list. 

State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 2` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, and `step` is `step + 2`.**
