The code `line = line[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `line`. The value of `line` is assigned to itself, meaning that the contents of `line` remain unchanged, but a new object is created in memory that is a copy of the original list. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 1` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is `step + 1`, and `line` remains unchanged as a list at index `step + 1` in `side`.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 1` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is `step + 1`, and `line` remains unchanged as a list at index `step + 1` in `side`.**
