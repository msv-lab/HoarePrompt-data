Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 2` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, and `line` is a new shallow copy of the original list. If `cross` is empty (i.e., evaluates to False), the function returns the tuple (False, False). Otherwise, there is no specified action.***
