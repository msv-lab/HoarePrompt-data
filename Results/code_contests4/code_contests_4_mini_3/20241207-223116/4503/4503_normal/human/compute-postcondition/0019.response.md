According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `side` list. Since `side` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `step` corresponds to the index of the current element in `side`, which is `step`. The loop index `step` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, if the loop executes again, `step` will be `step + 1`, and `line` will be the next element in `side`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least `step + 1` elements in `side`.

State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 1` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is `step + 1`, and `line` is the element at index `step + 1` in `side`**.
