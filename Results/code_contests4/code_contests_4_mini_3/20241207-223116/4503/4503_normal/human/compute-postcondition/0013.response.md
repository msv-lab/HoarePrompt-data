The value of `pos` is decremented by 1. Given that `pos` is initialized as `start - 1`, it is greater than 0. After the execution of `pos -= 1`, the new value of `pos` will be `start - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 2`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, `line` is the first element of `side`, and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` is truthy.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 2`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, `line` is the first element of `side`, and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` is truthy.**
