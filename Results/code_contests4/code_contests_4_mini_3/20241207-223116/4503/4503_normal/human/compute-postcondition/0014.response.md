Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 1`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, and `line` is the first element of `side` (unchanged). The value of `pos` is less than or equal to 0 or the element at `line[pos - 1]` is false (or empty). If `add` equals `step`, the conditions of the precondition remain unchanged.***
