The statement `line = line[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `line`. This means that the variable `line` will now point to a new list that contains the same elements as the original list `line`, but any subsequent modifications to the new `line` will not affect the original list. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 2` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `step` is `step + 2`, and `line` is a new shallow copy of the original list.**
