Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is now less than `end`, and the element at `line[pos]` is true (or not empty) if `pos` was less than `end` and `line[pos]` was true. Otherwise, the conditions of the precondition remain unchanged.***
