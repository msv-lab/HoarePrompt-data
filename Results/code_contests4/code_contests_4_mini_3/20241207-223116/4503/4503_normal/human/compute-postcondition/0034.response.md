Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 2` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `line` is a new shallow copy of the original list, and if `add` equals `step`, if `cross` is empty, the function returns the tuple (False, False). Otherwise, no specific action is defined.***
