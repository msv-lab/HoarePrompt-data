The variable `end` is assigned the value `len(side[0])`, which represents the length of the first element in the list `side`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `side`, but it is stated that `side` is a positive integer representing the hit place (1 ≤ side ≤ n). Assuming `side` is a list of strings, `len(side[0])` will give the length of that first string. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a non-negative integer, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a non-negative integer, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`**.
