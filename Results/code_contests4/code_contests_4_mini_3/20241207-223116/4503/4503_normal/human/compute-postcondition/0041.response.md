The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: 

1. `start`: a positive integer representing the selected vertical line (1 ≤ start ≤ n).
2. `side`: a positive integer representing the hit place (1 ≤ side ≤ n).
3. `add`: a non-negative integer representing the number of stages (1 ≤ add ≤ 30).
4. `left`: a list of strings of length n-1, where each string consists of '0's and '1's indicating the presence or absence of horizontal lines between the vertical lines. 

After executing the function body, the function can return different outputs based on the conditions checked:

- Case 1: The function returns two values, both are `False`.
- Case 2: The function returns a tuple `(False, False)`.
- Case 3: The function returns a tuple `(False, False)`.
- Case 4: The function returns the final result `'cross'` from the last execution of `'func_1'` and `pos` incremented by 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept specific parameters representing a vertical line, hit place, number of stages, and the presence of horizontal lines, and return various outputs based on the internal conditions evaluated during execution.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left`, and can return either two `False` values, a tuple `(False, False)`, or a tuple containing the final result `'cross'` and an incremented position.**
