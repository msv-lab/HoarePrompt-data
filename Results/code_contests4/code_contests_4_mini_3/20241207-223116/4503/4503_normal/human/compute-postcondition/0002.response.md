The value of `add` is decremented by 1, but since the initial value of `add` is a non-negative integer, it can either remain the same (if it was 0) or decrease by 1 (if it was greater than 0). The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1 (or remains the same if it was 0), `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 1`.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1 (or remains the same if it was 0), `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 1**
