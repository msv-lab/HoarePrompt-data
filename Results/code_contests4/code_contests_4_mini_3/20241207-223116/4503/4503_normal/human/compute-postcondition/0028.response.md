Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 1` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, and `step` is `step + 1`. If `pos` is greater than 0 and `line[pos - 1]` is true, then `pos` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true, then `pos` is increased by 1; otherwise, no changes occur. If `add` equals `step` and `cross` is False, the function returns a tuple (False, False). If `cross` is True, the function does not return anything.***
