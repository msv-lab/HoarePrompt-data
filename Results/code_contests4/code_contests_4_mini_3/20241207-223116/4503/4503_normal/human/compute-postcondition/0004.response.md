According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `side` variable. The loop will execute if `side` contains at least one element, meaning its length must be greater than 0. 

Given that `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, and `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, we must ensure that `side` has at least one element to allow the loop to run. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `step` should be initialized to 0, and `line` should be the first element of `side`.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:
- `side` is a list with at least 1 element.
- `step` is 0.
- `line` is the first element of `side`.

State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 1`, `cross` is 0, `step` is 0, `line` is the first element of `side`**
