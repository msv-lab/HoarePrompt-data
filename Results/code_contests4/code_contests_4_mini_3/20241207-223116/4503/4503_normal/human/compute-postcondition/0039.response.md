Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `n-1` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is a value determined by the last evaluated conditions in the loop (which may be 0 or `end`), and `cross` is the final result from the last execution of `func_1` or remains 0 if `add` never matched `step`.**
