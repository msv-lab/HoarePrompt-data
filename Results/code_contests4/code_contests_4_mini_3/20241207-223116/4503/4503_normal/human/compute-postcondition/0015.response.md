Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `pos` is `start - 1`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, `line` is the first element of `side`, the value of `pos` is less than `end`, and the element at `line[pos]` is true (or not empty). If `add` equals `step`, the conditions of the precondition remain unchanged.***
