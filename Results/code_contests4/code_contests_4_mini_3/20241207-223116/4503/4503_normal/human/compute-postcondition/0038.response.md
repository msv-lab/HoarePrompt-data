Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 2` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `line` is a new shallow copy of the original list. If `pos` is greater than 0 and `line[pos - 1]` is truthy, then `pos` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is truthy, then `pos` is increased by 1. If neither condition is met, no specific action is taken.***
