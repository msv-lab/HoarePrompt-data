Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, and `cross` is not equal to zero. If `pos` (which is `start - 1`) is greater than 0 and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` is truthy, then `pos` is updated to `start - 2`. Otherwise, if `pos` is less than `end`, then `pos` is now less than `end`, and the element at `line[pos]` is true (or not empty) if `pos` was less than `end` and `line[pos]` was true. If neither case applies, the conditions of the precondition remain unchanged.***
