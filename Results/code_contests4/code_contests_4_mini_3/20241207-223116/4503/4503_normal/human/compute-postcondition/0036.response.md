The value of `pos` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pos` is unknown. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 2` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `line` is a new shallow copy of the original list, and `pos` is increased by 1.
