Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least `step + 1` elements, `add` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, `end` is the length of the first string in `side`, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `step` is `step + 1`, and `line` remains unchanged as a list at index `step + 1` in `side`. If `add` equals `step` and `cross` is False, the function returns a tuple (False, False). If `cross` is True, the function does not return anything. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
