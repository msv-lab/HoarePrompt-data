Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `start`, a list of strings `side`, a non-negative integer `add`, and a list of strings `left`. It processes these inputs to determine a position on a vertical line and potentially the result of a call to another function, `func_1`, based on the `add` value. It returns a tuple containing the result of `func_1` (or `False` if certain conditions are met) and the final position incremented by 1. If the `add` value does not match any step in the loop, the position may not be updated meaningfully, and the function could return values that indicate no valid crossing occurred.**
