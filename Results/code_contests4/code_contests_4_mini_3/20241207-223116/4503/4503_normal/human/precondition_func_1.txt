start is a positive integer representing the selected vertical line (1 ≤ start ≤ n), side is a positive integer representing the hit place (1 ≤ side ≤ n), add is a non-negative integer representing the number of stages (1 ≤ add ≤ 30), and left is a list of strings of length n-1, where each string consists of '0's and '1's indicating the presence or absence of horizontal lines between the vertical lines. n is a positive integer (1 < n ≤ 10).
