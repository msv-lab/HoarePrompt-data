The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `S`. `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, and `S` is a list of length `N` containing characters where each character is either 'P', 'W', 'G', or 'Y'. Additionally, the list `S` contains at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G'. The function's output is not explicitly described, but it is implied that it processes the characters in `S` based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N and a list S of length N containing characters 'P', 'W', 'G', or 'Y', ensuring at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G' are present in S.**
