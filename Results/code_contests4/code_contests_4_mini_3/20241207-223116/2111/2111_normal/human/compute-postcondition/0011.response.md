The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is -1, `S` is a list of characters from the previous value of `N`, `i` is 1, and 'Four' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
