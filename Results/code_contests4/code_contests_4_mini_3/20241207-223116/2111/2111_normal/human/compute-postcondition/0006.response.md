The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is -1, `S` is a list of characters split from `N`, `i` is 0, the first character of `S` is 'Y', and the output is 'Four' while we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
