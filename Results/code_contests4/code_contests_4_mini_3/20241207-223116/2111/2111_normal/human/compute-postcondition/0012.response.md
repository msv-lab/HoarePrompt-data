Postcondition: ***`N` is a string input representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `S` is a list of characters from `N`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `S` is 'Y', then `N` is -1, 'Four' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part to consider in this case.***
