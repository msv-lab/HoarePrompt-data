The function accepts an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 100) and a list `S` of length `N` containing characters 'P', 'W', 'G', or 'Y', ensuring at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G' are present in `S`. The function checks if any character in `S` is 'Y'; if so, it prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1. If `N` is -1, it prints 'Three'. However, it does not return any values and does not handle cases where `N` is 0 or negative, nor does it account for the absence of 'P', 'W', or 'G'.
