The provided program has a critical flaw in its logic that prevents it from correctly implementing the requirements laid out in the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program attempts to read the input using `N = input()` and `S = raw_input.split()`, where `raw_input` is likely intended to be the string of colors. However, `raw_input` is not defined in Python 3, and thus this will raise an error. The correct usage would be to read the input as a single string and then split it.

2. **Logic to Determine the Number of Colors**: The program checks for the presence of 'Y' to determine if there are four colors and prints 'Four' immediately if it finds 'Y'. This is correct for identifying four colors. However, the subsequent check with `if (N == -1)` is erroneous. This check is meant to print 'Three' if 'Y' is found, which is logically inconsistent since 'Y' being present indicates four colors, not three.

3. **Failure to Count Unique Colors**: The program does not actually count the unique colors in the list `S`. Instead, it relies on finding 'Y' to conclude that the number of colors is four. If 'Y' is not present, it defaults to stating 'Three' even if there might be cases where only two colors are present (which, according to the problem description, should not happen). 

4. **Invalid Assumptions**: The program assumes that the absence of 'Y' means there are only three colors, which ignores the possibility of color combinations that could lead to incorrect outputs. The problem description guarantees at least one each of 'P', 'W', and 'G', but it does not ensure a fourth color does not exist when 'Y' is absent.

Given these flaws, the program cannot accurately determine the number of colors in all potential cases as required by the problem description. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to follow the problem description as it incorrectly handles input and does not correctly determine the number of unique colors. It does not return the correct output when there are only three colors and fails to accurately count distinct color representations.
