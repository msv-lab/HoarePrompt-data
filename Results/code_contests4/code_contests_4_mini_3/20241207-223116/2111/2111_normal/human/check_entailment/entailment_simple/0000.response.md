Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input.split()` to read and split the input, but it should use `input()` to read the first line and then split the second line for the colors. Additionally, `raw_input` is not a valid function in Python 3, which is the current version.

2. **Logic for Color Count**: The program incorrectly checks if the color 'Y' exists to determine if there are four colors. If 'Y' is found, it prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1. This is incorrect because the output should be 'Four' if there are four distinct colors and 'Three' if only three distinct colors are present. The program does not check for the presence of colors other than 'Y' correctly.

3. **Output Logic**: The conditional check after the loop is flawed. After finding 'Y', it prints 'Three' (which is incorrect). The appropriate logic should involve checking the unique colors in the list `S` to determine if there are three or four distinct colors.

4. **Failure to Count Distinct Colors**: The program does not utilize any method to count or determine the number of distinct colors in the list `S`. It should use a set to determine the distinct colors present in `S` and then check the length of that set to decide the output.

Overall, the program fails to meet the problem description as it does not correctly determine the number of distinct colors and handle input properly.
