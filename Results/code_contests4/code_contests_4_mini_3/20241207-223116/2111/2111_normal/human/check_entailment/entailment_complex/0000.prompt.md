You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In Japan, people make offerings called hina arare, colorful crackers, on March 3.

We have a bag that contains N hina arare. (From here, we call them arare.)

It is known that the bag either contains arare in three colors: pink, white and green, or contains arare in four colors: pink, white, green and yellow.

We have taken out the arare in the bag one by one, and the color of the i-th arare was S_i, where colors are represented as follows - pink: `P`, white: `W`, green: `G`, yellow: `Y`.

If the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, print `Three`; if the number of colors was four, print `Four`.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* S_i is `P`, `W`, `G` or `Y`.
* There always exist i, j and k such that S_i=`P`, S_j=`W` and S_k=`G`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S_1 S_2 ... S_N


Output

If the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, print `Three`; if the number of colors was four, print `Four`.

Examples

Input

6
G W Y P Y W


Output

Four


Input

9
G W W G P W P G G


Output

Three


Input

8
P Y W G Y W Y Y


Output

Four
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, and S is a list of length N containing characters where each character is either 'P', 'W', 'G', or 'Y', with at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G' present in the list.
def func():
    N = input()
    S = raw_input.split()
    for i in range(N):
        if S[i] == 'Y':
            print('Four')
            N = -1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is -1 if any character in `S` is 'Y', `S` is a list of characters from the original string input, and `i` is less than `N` or equal to the length of `S` - 1.
    if (N == -1) :
        print('Three')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`N` is -1, `S` is a list of characters derived from the original string input, and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `S` - 1. If `N` is -1, then 'Three' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 100) and a list `S` of length `N` containing characters 'P', 'W', 'G', or 'Y', ensuring at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G' are present in `S`. The function checks if any character in `S` is 'Y'; if so, it prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1. If `N` is -1, it prints 'Three'. However, it does not return any values and does not handle cases where `N` is 0 or negative, nor does it account for the absence of 'P', 'W', or 'G'.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
