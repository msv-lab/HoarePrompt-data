Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. The program uses `raw_input.split()`, which is incorrect in Python 3; it should be `input().split()`.
2. The variable `N` is assigned the value of `input()`, which is a string. It should be converted to an integer using `int(N)`.
3. The logic to determine the number of colors is flawed. The program checks for the presence of 'Y' and immediately prints "Four". However, it should count the distinct colors instead of just checking for 'Y'. If 'Y' is not present but the other three colors ('P', 'W', 'G') are, it should print "Three".
4. The condition `if N == -1:` does not serve the intended purpose and will not function correctly as intended.

A potential case where the program fails is:
- Input: `3\nP W G` (which has three distinct colors: pink, white, green). The expected output should be "Three", but the program will print "Four" if the last color checked is 'Y' or not handle this case correctly.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
