Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input.split()`, which is not valid in Python 3. Instead, it should use `input().split()` to read and split the input string.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Color Counting**: The program checks for the presence of the yellow color ('Y') to determine whether to print 'Four'. If it finds 'Y', it immediately prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1, which is not necessary. This logic is flawed because if 'Y' is not present but other colors are, it will incorrectly print 'Three' without checking for the remaining colors.

3. **Failure to Count Unique Colors**: The program does not check the unique colors in the list `S`. It should determine the number of distinct colors present in the list instead of relying solely on the presence of 'Y'.

To illustrate a case where this program fails:
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  P W G P
  ```
  Expected Output: `Three` (since only pink, white, and green are present).
  Actual Output: The program would output `Three` because it would not find 'Y' and would incorrectly set `N` to -1 without evaluating the colors properly.

Hence, due to the flawed logic and incorrect handling of inputs, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
