To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements.

The task is to find the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can create by inserting one extra photo (from 'a' to 'z') into an existing string of photos (the photobook) represented by lowercase letters. 

Given the constraints:

1. For every position in the string (including before the first character and after the last character), we can insert one of the 26 letters ('a' to 'z').
2. The total number of positions to insert a letter into a string of length `n` is `n + 1` (one before each character and one at the end).
3. Each insertion creates a new distinct string unless the inserted character is the same as the character already present at that position.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
n = raw_input()
print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
```

1. `len(n) + 1` calculates the number of positions where a new letter can be inserted.
2. Multiplying that by 26 gives the total combinations of inserting any letter into any of the positions.
3. The code then subtracts `len(n)` which appears to be an attempt to remove cases where inserting the same letter as an adjacent character would count as a duplicate.

However, the logic has a flaw. The code does not correctly account for the cases where inserting the same character at each position could create duplicates. For instance, if the input is "aa", inserting 'a' into any of the positions will yield duplicates (e.g., 'aaa'), and this has not been handled correctly.

For example:
- Input: "aa"
- According to the problem description, there are 27 distinct combinations:
    - 'aaa' (duplicate)
    - 'aab'
    - 'aac'
    - ...
    - 'aaz'
    - 'baa'
    - ...
    - 'zaa'
    - 'ab', 'ac', ..., 'az' (inserted before the first 'a')
    - and similar cases for other letters, but the duplicates will not be counted correctly.

Thus, the program will produce an incorrect output for this case.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the distinct combinations of inserting letters into the photobook that may lead to duplicates, as shown with the example of "aa".
