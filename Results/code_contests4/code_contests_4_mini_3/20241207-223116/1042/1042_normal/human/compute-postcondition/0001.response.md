The code prints the result of the expression `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)`. The variable `n` is an input string, so its length is determined by the input value. The length of `s` is not affected by this code.

1. `len(n)` calculates the length of the input string `n`.
2. We add 1 to this length.
3. We multiply the result by 26.
4. We then subtract the length of `n` from this product.

Therefore, the output state will show the length of `n` being considered in the calculations, but `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 20, consisting only of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input string; result is calculated as (len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n).**
