The value of `n` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input from the user and stores it as a string. The variable `s` is not affected by this operation, so its state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 20, consisting only of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 20, consisting only of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input string.**
