The function `func` does not accept any parameters and instead reads input directly from the user using `raw_input()`. It calculates a value based on the length of the string input. Specifically, it computes the expression `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)`, where `n` is the string input. This calculation is intended to produce a numeric result based on the length of `n`, but it does not return or print any meaningful result to the user. Instead, it just prints the computed value and does not handle any edge cases explicitly, such as input validation or error handling for unexpected input.

Functionality: ** The function reads a string from user input, calculates a value based on its length, and prints the result. However, it does not return any value or handle edge cases, such as invalid input types. **
