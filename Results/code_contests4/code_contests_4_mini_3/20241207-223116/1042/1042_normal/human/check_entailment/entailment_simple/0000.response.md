The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the requirements and the program's behavior.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Kyoya has a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters (photos).
2. He wants to insert one extra photo (one of the 26 letters 'a' to 'z') into the string `s`.
3. We need to calculate how many distinct photobooks can be created by inserting one extra photo into the existing string.

### Analyzing the Program:
The program has the following logic:
- It reads a string input `n`.
- It calculates `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)`.

### The Calculation:
1. `len(n) + 1` represents the number of positions where a new photo can be inserted (before the first character, between characters, and after the last character).
2. The program multiplies by `26` to account for the 26 different photos that can be inserted.
3. Finally, it subtracts `len(n)`, but this logic is incorrect because it does not account for duplicates correctly.

### Issues with the Calculation:
- The formula `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` does not correctly account for distinct photobooks. For example, if `s` already contains a letter that is being added again, that would not create a new distinct photobook.
- The example provided in the problem indicates that for `s = "a"`, the distinct photobooks should include duplicates like "aa", and the total is 51, which the program would not accurately calculate.
- The program does not handle the case of duplicates within the string `s` properly.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program fails to correctly compute the number of distinct photobooks that can be created by inserting one extra photo according to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
