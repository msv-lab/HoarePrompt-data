To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first analyze the requirements.

**Problem Description Analysis:**
Kyoya Ootori wants to create distinct photobooks by inserting one extra photo (from 'a' to 'z') into an existing string of photos. For a string of length `n`, he can insert any of the 26 photos at `n + 1` possible positions (before, between, and after each character). The distinct combinations should be calculated.

**Program Analysis:**
The provided code is:
```python
n = raw_input()
print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
```

1. `len(n) + 1` calculates the number of positions where a new photo can be inserted.
2. Multiplying this by `26` gives the total combinations of photos that can be inserted.
3. The `- len(n)` appears to subtract the original photos, but this logic seems flawed.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints indicate that the program reads a string, calculates a value, and prints a result. It notes the lack of return value and handling of edge cases. 

**Key Observations:**
- The calculation `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` does not correspond to the expected behavior of generating distinct photobooks. For example, if `n` is "hi", the correct number of distinct photobooks would be `76`. However, the formula could potentially yield an incorrect value because it incorrectly subtracts the length of `n`, which does not align with the logic needed to compute distinct combinations.

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
- If `n` is an empty string, the program would output `26` (which is correct, as you can insert any of the 26 letters).
- If `n` has duplicates or is of maximum length (20), the program does not consider distinctiveness of the resulting combinations adequately.

In conclusion, the code does not follow the problem description accurately in terms of calculating the number of distinct photobooks. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to accurately compute the number of distinct combinations for cases where the original string has characters that may repeat or under-accounts for scenarios where the length of the input should not be subtracted from the total combinations.
