Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. 

Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Misunderstanding of the Problem**: The goal is to insert one extra photo (a letter from 'a' to 'z') into the existing string `s`, and then count the number of distinct resultant strings. The program should compute how many unique strings can be formed by inserting any of the 26 letters into every possible position of the original string.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula used in the program, `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)`, does not yield the correct count of distinct photobooks. Instead, it seems to calculate a value based on the length of the input string, but it does not account for the uniqueness of the characters in the string or correctly handle the insertion of the new characters at various positions.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the result using `print`, but it does not return a value as specified in the problem (output should be an integer, not just printed). It also does not handle edge cases, such as ensuring that the input is valid.

4. **Example Case Validation**: 
   - For the input "a", the correct output should be 51 (as described in the problem). However, using the provided formula:
     - Length of "a" is 1: `(1 + 1) * 26 - 1 = 2 * 26 - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51` 
     - It appears correct, but this is coincidental; the logic is flawed and does not extend correctly to other cases.
   - For the input "hi", the expected output should be 76. However, using the same formula:
     - Length of "hi" is 2: `(2 + 1) * 26 - 2 = 3 * 26 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76` 
     - Again, it happens to give the correct output, but the reasoning and methodology are incorrect.

5. **Edge Cases and Duplicates**: The program does not consider cases where `s` contains duplicate characters, which would affect the total count of distinct strings that can be formed.

Due to these critical flaws in logic, calculation, and handling of input, the program does not reliably solve the problem as described. Thus, it is determined to be incorrect.
