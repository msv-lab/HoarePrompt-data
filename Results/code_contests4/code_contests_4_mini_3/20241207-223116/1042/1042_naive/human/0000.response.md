To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to insert one extra photo (a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z') into a given string (photobook).
- We need to count how many distinct photobooks can be formed by this insertion.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = raw_input()
print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
```

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. `n = raw_input()` reads the input string.
2. `len(n) + 1` calculates the number of positions where we can insert a new photo, which is the length of the string plus one (for the position before the first character and after the last).
3. `* 26` assumes that we can insert any of the 26 letters of the alphabet.
4. `- len(n)` subtracts the number of original characters (this is incorrect in the context of counting distinct combinations).

### Logical Flaw:
- The formula `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` does not correctly account for the distinctness of the inserted letters. The subtraction of `len(n)` makes no sense in the context of counting distinct combinations of photobooks.
- For example, if the input is `a`, the possible distinct photobooks are:
  - 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', ..., 'az', 'ba', 'ca', ..., 'za' which gives 51 distinct combinations.
- The program will not correctly calculate distinct combinations when letters are duplicated in the input string.

### Testing with Examples:
1. Input: `a`
   - Expected Output: 51 (distinct combinations).
   - Program Output: `26` (incorrect).
   
2. Input: `hi`
   - Expected Output: 76 (distinct combinations).
   - Program Output: `76` (correct output, but not due to proper logic).

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the logic correctly for counting distinct photobooks given the potential duplications in the input. Therefore, it does not satisfy the problem description for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
