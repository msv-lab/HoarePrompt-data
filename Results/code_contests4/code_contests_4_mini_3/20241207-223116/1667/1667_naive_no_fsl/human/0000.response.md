Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. 

### Issue:
The critical issue arises from how the program calculates the maximum points. The program initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` but only considers indices up to `n` when it should consider the maximum possible value in the sequence, which can be up to `10^5`. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 1 2 3 3
```
The expected behavior is:
1. Choose `2`, which gives `2` points. Remaining sequence: `[1, 1, 3, 3]`.
2. Next, choose `3`, giving `3` points. Remaining sequence: `[1, 1]`.
3. Finally, choose `1`, giving `1` point. Remaining sequence: `[]`.

Total points: `2 + 3 + 1 = 6`.

However, the program might not yield this output due to its limited handling of the `dp` array size and potential miscalculations resulting from the incorrect initialization and logic in handling frequencies.

Thus, there are cases where the program fails to provide the correct output, leading to the conclusion that its correctness is indeed flawed.
