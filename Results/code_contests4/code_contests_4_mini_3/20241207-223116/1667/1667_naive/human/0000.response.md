To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to maximize the points Alex can earn by strategically choosing elements from the sequence.
   - When choosing an element `ak`, all instances of `ak`, `ak + 1`, and `ak - 1` must be removed from the sequence.
   - The program should calculate the maximum points Alex can earn based on the frequency of each number in the sequence.

2. **Reviewing the Program**:
   - The program reads the input and counts the frequency of each number in the sequence `a`.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming (dp) list where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points that can be earned using numbers from `1` to `i`.
   - The logic in the loop iterates through numbers from `2` to `n` to fill the `dp` array by choosing either to take the points from `i` or not.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes it can fill `dp` up to `n`, but the array for frequencies is based on the values in `a`, which can go up to `100,000`. 
   - If `n` is less than the maximum value in `a`, the program could potentially access `dp` out of bounds since it assumes `n` is the upper bound for the values in `a`.

4. **Testing with Input**:
   - Let's consider an edge case where `n = 1` and `a = [100000]`. 
     - The program would attempt to access `dp[100000]`, which would not be initialized in the `dp` list as it is only initialized for `0` to `n` where `n < 100000`.
   - This would lead to an index error or incorrect logic since the maximum frequency could not be computed correctly.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where `n` does not cover the maximum possible values of `a`.
   - Since it fails to avoid potential out-of-bounds access in the `dp` list when the maximum value in `a` exceeds `n`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
