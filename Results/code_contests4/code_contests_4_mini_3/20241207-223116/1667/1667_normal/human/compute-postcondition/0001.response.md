The code defines a lambda function `ma` that takes two parameters: `fxn` and `ti`. The function applies `map` to `ti.split()`, which splits the string `ti` into a list of substrings, and then applies the function `fxn` to each of those substrings. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not directly affected by this lambda function definition. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the newly defined lambda function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100,000; the sequence `a` consists of `n` integers in the range 1 to 100,000; `ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `ma` is a lambda function that maps a function to the split input string.**
