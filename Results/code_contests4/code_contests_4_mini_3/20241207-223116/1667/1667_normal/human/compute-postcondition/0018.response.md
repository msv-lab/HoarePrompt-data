According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 2 and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2, which means that the loop has executed for `i` equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3**
