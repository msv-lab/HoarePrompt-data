The provided code defines a new lambda function `olws`, which takes an array `arr` as an argument. This function uses the `stdout.write` method to write the joined string representation of the integers in `arr` followed by a newline character. The variables `n`, `a`, `ti`, `ma`, and `os` are not modified by this assignment, and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100,000; the sequence `a` consists of `n` integers in the range 1 to 100,000; `ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `ma` is a lambda function that maps a function to the split input string; `os` is a lambda function that writes a string representation of an integer followed by a newline to standard output; `olws` is a lambda function that writes the joined string representation of an array to standard output.**
