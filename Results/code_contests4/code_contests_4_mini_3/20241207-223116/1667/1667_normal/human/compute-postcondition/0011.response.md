The code snippet `freq[a[i]] += 1` modifies the `freq` array (or list) at the index `a[i]`, which indicates the value at index `i` of the array `a`. This operation increments the count of the value `a[i]` in the `freq` array by 1. The variables `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation, but the value of `i` must be within the bounds of `a`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

Since `n` is an input integer in the range 1 to 100,000, and `i` starts at 1, the output state will reflect that `freq[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for the current value of `a[i]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 1 to 100,000, `i` is 1, `freq[a[i]]` is incremented by 1**.
