According to the code, the loop starts with `i` initialized to 2 and continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2. Given that `n` is defined to be in the range of 1 to 100,000, if `n` is equal to 1, the loop will not execute. Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

At the start of the first iteration, `i` will be 2. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the following conditions must be met:

1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
2. `i` starts at 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `freq` is a list where each index corresponds to a value in `a`, `dp` is a list with the first element as `0` and the second element as `freq[1]`**
