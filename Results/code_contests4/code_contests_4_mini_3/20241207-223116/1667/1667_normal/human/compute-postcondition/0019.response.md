The code appends a value to the list `dp` based on a calculation involving the current values of `dp`, `freq`, and `i`. The function `max()` is used to determine the larger of two values: `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i`.

Given that `i` is 3, the expressions evaluate as follows:

- `dp[i - 1]` corresponds to `dp[2]`.
- `dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i` corresponds to `dp[1] + freq[3] * 3`.

Since the initial state indicates that `n` is at least 2, the calculation can be performed provided `dp` and `freq` have appropriate values for indices 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the output state will depend on how `dp` and `freq` are defined but generally states that a new value has been appended.

Output State: **`dp` is updated with max(dp[2], dp[1] + freq[3] * 3)**
