According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `i` and the limit `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 2 and will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` will increase by 1 for the next iteration). 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`dp` is updated with max(dp[2], dp[1] + freq[3] * 3), for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is 3**
