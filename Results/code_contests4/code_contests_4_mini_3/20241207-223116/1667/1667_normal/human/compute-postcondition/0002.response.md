The code defines a lambda function `ol` that takes an array `arr` as an argument. This function converts each element of `arr` to a string, joins them with spaces, and writes the resulting string to standard output followed by a newline. The previous values of `n`, `a`, `ti`, and `ma` remain unaffected by this definition of `ol`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100,000; the sequence `a` consists of `n` integers in the range 1 to 100,000; `ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `ma` is a lambda function that maps a function to the split input string; `ol` is a lambda function that writes the joined string representation of an array to standard output.**
