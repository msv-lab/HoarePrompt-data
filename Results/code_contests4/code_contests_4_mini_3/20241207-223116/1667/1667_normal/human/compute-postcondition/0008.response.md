According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be in the range of 1 to 100,000 based on the given state, the loop will execute at least once. Additionally, the variable `i` should be initialized before the loop starts. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` will take the value of 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, the state adjustments are as follows:

State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 1 to 100,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
