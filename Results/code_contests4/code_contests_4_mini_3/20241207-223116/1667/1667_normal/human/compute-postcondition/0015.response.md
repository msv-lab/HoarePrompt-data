`dp` is assigned a list where the first element is `0` and the second element is `freq[1]`. The value of `freq[1]` is dependent on the input integer `n` and the counts of occurrences of the value `1` in the list `a`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer in the range 1 to 100,000; `freq` is a list where each index corresponds to a value in `a`; `dp` is a list with the first element as `0` and the second element as `freq[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 1 to 100,000; `freq` is a list where each index corresponds to a value in `a`; `dp` is a list with the first element as `0` and the second element as `freq[1]`**.
