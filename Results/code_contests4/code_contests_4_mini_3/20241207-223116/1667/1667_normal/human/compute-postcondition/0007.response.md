The code initializes a list called `freq` with a size of \(10^5 + 1\), which means it will contain 100,001 elements, all initialized to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n` or `a`, and it simply allocates memory for the `freq` list. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `n` and `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 1 to 100,000; `a` is assigned the value of `ma(int, ti()); freq` is a list of size 100001 initialized to zeros.**
