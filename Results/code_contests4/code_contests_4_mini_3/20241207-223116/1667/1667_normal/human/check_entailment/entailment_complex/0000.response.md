Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Here's the breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** The goal is to maximize the points Alex can earn by choosing elements from the sequence while adhering to the rules of deletion (removing elements equal to ak - 1 and ak + 1 when ak is chosen).

2. **Input Handling:** 
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of integers in the sequence, and then reads the sequence of integers `a`. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

3. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program constructs an array `freq` where each index corresponds to a value in the sequence, and `freq[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`. This is crucial for determining how many points can be earned from each integer.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points that can be earned by considering integers from `1` to `i`. The transition ensures that if `i` is chosen, the previous integer `i-1` cannot be counted, thus the logic `dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i)` correctly adheres to the problem constraints.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The last element in the `dp` array represents the maximum points that can be earned from the entire sequence, which is printed as the result.

The logic implemented in the code accurately reflects the rules and requirements laid out in the problem description, ensuring that all potential cases are handled correctly. Hence, the program is correct.
