To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly implements the game mechanics as described.

### Problem Breakdown
1. You have a sequence of integers.
2. You can choose an integer `ak` from the sequence and delete it along with all occurrences of `ak + 1` and `ak - 1`.
3. The points you earn from choosing `ak` is equal to its value multiplied by its frequency in the sequence.
4. The goal is to maximize the total points earned.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of integers `n` and the sequence `a`.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: 
   - The program initializes an array `freq` to count occurrences of each integer in the sequence. This is correctly done as it loops through the sequence and populates the `freq` array.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - The program initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points earned considering integers from `1` to `i`.
   - The relation `dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i)` correctly implements the logic:
     - `dp[i - 1]`: skipping the current integer `i`.
     - `dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i`: taking the current integer `i` and adding its points while skipping the adjacent integer `i - 1`.
4. **Final Output**: The program correctly outputs the maximum points stored in `dp[n]`.

### Conclusion
The dynamic programming approach effectively handles the conditions of the game described. The program ensures that when choosing an integer `ak`, it accounts for the deletion of `ak`, `ak + 1`, and `ak - 1` by ensuring that if `ak` is chosen, the program will not add points for `ak - 1` in the next step.

The program adheres to the problem description and successfully calculates the maximum points Alex can earn.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
