The function accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of integers in the sequence, and a sequence of `n` integers ranging from 1 to 100,000. It calculates the maximum sum of values by considering the frequency of each integer while ensuring that no two adjacent integers are counted. The function returns this maximum sum as output.
