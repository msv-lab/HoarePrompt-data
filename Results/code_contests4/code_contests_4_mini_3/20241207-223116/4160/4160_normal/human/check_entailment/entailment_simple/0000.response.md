To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step and see if it adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have `n` programmers, `m` lines of code to write.
2. Each programmer `i` has a bug rate `a[i]`, meaning they introduce `a[i]` bugs for every line they write.
3. We need to find the number of distinct good plans where the total number of bugs does not exceed `b`.
4. The result should be printed modulo `mod`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads four integers `n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod`, followed by the list of integers `a` representing bugs per line for each programmer.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The program initializes a 3D list `mem` where:
   - `mem[i][j][k]` indicates the number of ways to distribute `j` lines of code among the first `i` programmers such that the total number of bugs does not exceed `k`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The outer loop iterates through programmers (`i` from 1 to `n`).
   - The middle loop iterates through the number of lines of code being assigned (`j` from 1 to `m`).
   - The innermost loop calculates the number of bugs up to `b` (`k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`).
   - The logic updates the `mem` array based on the number of lines written by the current programmer and adds the contributions from the previous programmer.

4. **Final Calculation**: After populating the `mem` array, the program sums up the possible plans for the last programmer, ensuring the total bug count does not exceed `b`, and stores it in `ans`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the result `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement a dynamic programming solution to count the distinct good plans according to the problem description. It constructs the `mem` array appropriately based on the number of lines written and the corresponding bug contributions of each programmer.

### Edge Cases:
1. If the total number of bugs exceeds `b` at any point, those plans are not counted, adhering to the requirement.
2. The program handles scenarios where `b` is 0, ensuring that only plans with zero bugs are counted.

Based on this analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

Correctness: **True**
