According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`, which starts from 1 and goes up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. 

Since it is stated that `j` must be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to continue executing, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `mem[0][1][k]` is derived from `mem[0][0][k - a[1]]` and `mem[0][0][k]` based on the operations performed in the loop, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2.**
