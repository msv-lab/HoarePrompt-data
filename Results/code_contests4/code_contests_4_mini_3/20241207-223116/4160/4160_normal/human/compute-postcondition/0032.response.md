In the provided code snippet, the line `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` updates the value of `mem` at the specified indices. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

- The variable `ix` is 1, which means `ix ^ 1` will evaluate to 0 (since XOR with 1 flips the least significant bit).
- The variable `j` is 3.
- The variable `k` is assigned the value `a[0]` as per the initial state, where `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, as stated.

The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[0][3][k]`, effectively copying the value from `mem[0][3][k]` to `mem[1][3][k]`. 

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `mod`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` is updated at indices [1][3][k] to the value of `mem[0][3][k]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[0]`.**
