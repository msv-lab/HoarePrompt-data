The code updates `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The variable `k` is now `a[i - 1] + 1`, where `i` is 2, so `k` is `a[1] + 1`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged. However, the specific values of `mem` and `a` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact result of the addition operation.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 2, `k` is now `a[i - 1] + 1`**.
