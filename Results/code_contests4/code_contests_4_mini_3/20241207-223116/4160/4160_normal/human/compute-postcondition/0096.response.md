The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. Given that `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is `b`, we need to evaluate `ix ^ 1`, which results in 0. Therefore, the assignment translates to:

`mem[1][2][b] = mem[0][2][b]`

The values of `ans`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged after this assignment. The output state summarizes the changes to `mem` based on the current values of `ix`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b`, and `mem[1][2][b]` is updated to `mem[0][2][b]`.**
