According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a[i - 1]`, and `b`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `a[1] + 2`, while `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. 

To determine the next state, we need to increment `k` by 1 for the next iteration. Thus, `k` will be updated to `a[1] + 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `b`, meaning `a[1] + 3` should be less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`mem[0][3][k]` is updated to `add(mem[0][3][k], mem[0][2][k - a[1]])`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[1] + 3`; for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.**
