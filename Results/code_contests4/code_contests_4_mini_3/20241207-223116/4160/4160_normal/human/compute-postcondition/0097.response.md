To determine the output state, let's analyze the code line by line and consider the impact on the variables.

1. The variable `k` is assigned the value `b`, and `ix`, `j`, and `k` are currently set to `1`, `2`, and `b`, respectively.
2. The expression `mem[ix][j][k]` refers to `mem[1][2][b]`.
3. The second part of the assignment, `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`, indicates we need to evaluate:
   - `mem[1][2][b]` (the current value of `mem[1][2][b]`)
   - `mem[1][1][b - a[2]]`, where `a[i - 1]` translates to `a[2]` since `i` is `3`.

The value of `mem[1][2][b]` is updated based on the result of the `add` function applied to the previous values.

However, without specific values for `a[2]`, `mem[1][2][b]`, and `mem[1][1][b - a[2]]`, we cannot determine the exact numerical outcome of the operation. Thus, the output state will reflect the assignment operation and the variables' current states without numeric resolution.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b`, `mem[1][2][b]` is updated based on `add(mem[1][2][b], mem[1][1][b - a[2]])`**
