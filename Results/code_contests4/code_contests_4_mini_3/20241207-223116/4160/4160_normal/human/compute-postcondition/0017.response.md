To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided:

1. The code updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding to it the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
2. Here, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is `a[0] + 1`. The variable `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[1 - 1]` which is `a[0]`.
3. Since `mem[1][1][k]` is being updated, and we know `mem[1][1][k]` is equal to `mem[0][1][k]`, we will also need the value of `mem[1][0][k - a[0]]` to perform the addition.

Given that:
- `mem[ix][j][k]` is `mem[1][1][k]`
- `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` becomes `mem[1][0][k - a[0]]`

The exact output state will depend on the initial values of `mem` and `a`, which are not provided. However, we know that `mem[1][1][k]` will be updated based on the addition of the value at `mem[1][0][k - a[0]]`.

As a result, the output state reflects the fact that `mem[1][1][k]` has been modified, and we can express that in the output state.

Output State: **`mem[1][1][k]` is updated by adding `mem[1][0][k - a[0]]` to it.**
