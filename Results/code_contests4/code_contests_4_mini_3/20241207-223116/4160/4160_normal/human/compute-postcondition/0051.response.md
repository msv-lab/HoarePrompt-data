According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`. The variable `k` has been incremented to `k + 1` at the end of the last iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `b`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions indicate that `k` is currently greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` and is now `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `b` after the increment, meaning `k` must be at most `b`. 

If `k` is incremented again, it will be `k + 1`, which must still satisfy the condition of being less than or equal to `b`. Hence, `k` needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it; `mem[0][1][k]` remains unchanged; `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`**.
