According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

For the loop to execute for the third time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to be executed again.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `b + 1`, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3**
