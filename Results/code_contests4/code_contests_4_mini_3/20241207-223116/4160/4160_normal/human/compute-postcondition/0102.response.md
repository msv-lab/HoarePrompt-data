According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it exceeds `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3, and it must still be less than or equal to `m`. 

So at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 3, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3 (which means `m` must be greater than or equal to 3).

State: **`mem[1][2][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[2]` to `b`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
