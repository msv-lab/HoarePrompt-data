The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m`, and for each `j`, it updates `mem[ix][j][k]` for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged at 0 throughout the iterations, while `i` and `ix` also remain constant at 2 and 0 respectively. After all iterations of the loop, `mem[ix][j][k]` will contain updated values based on the operations performed within the nested loops. 

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the state will be as follows:

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `b + 1`.**
