The code updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` have specific values: `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is `a[1]`. The value of `a[i - 1]` corresponds to `a[1]`, given that `i` is 2.

The output state will reflect that `mem[0][1][k]` is updated, and the previous state of `mem[0][1][k]` and the added value from `mem[0][0][k - a[1]]` is not specified in the initial state, which means we can only represent that the update occurs.

Output State: **`mem[0][1][k]` is updated by adding `mem[0][0][k - a[1]]` to it.**
