The code assigns a new value to `mem[ix][j][k]` by calling the `add` function with two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. To determine the new value, we need to understand the previously assigned values.

1. `mem[ix][j][k]` is currently assigned the value of `mem[1][j][k]`.
2. The variable `ans` remains unchanged at 0.
3. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2.
4. The variable `ix` remains unchanged at 0.
5. The variable `j` is 2.
6. The variable `k` is `a[i - 1] + 3`, which means `k` is computed based on the value of `a` at index `1` plus 3. The specific value depends on the contents of array `a`. The condition states that this value must be less than or equal to `b`.

The impact of the code can be summarized as follows:
- `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to be the result of the `add` function, which combines the current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` (which was assigned from `mem[1][j][k]`) and another value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Since we don't have specific values for the arrays and variables, we note that `mem[ix][j][k]` is modified based on the `add` function. The specific calculation cannot be made without the values; hence, we will state the operation generically.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 2, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 3` and must be â‰¤ `b`.**
