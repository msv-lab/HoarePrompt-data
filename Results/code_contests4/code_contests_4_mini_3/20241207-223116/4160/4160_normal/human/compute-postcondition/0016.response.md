The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` equals 0. The indices `j` and `k` remain unchanged. Since `mem[1][1][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[0][1][k]`, the states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of `rints()`, `mem` has been updated at indices [1][1][1], `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is `a[0] + 1`, while `mem[1][1][k]` is now equal to `mem[0][1][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` has been updated at indices [1][1][1], `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[0] + 1`, and `mem[1][1][k]` is now equal to `mem[0][1][k]`.**
