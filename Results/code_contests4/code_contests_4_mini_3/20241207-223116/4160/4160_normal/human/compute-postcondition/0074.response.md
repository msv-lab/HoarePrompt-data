The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is currently 0, so `ix ^ 1` equals 1. The value of `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[1] + 4`. The other variables `ans`, `i`, and `ix` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `mem[0][3][k]` based on the previous state of `mem[1][3][k]`.

Output State: **`ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[1] + 4; mem[0][3][k] is updated with the value from mem[1][3][k]**
