The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The previous state indicates that `ix` is 0, so `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 1. The values of `j` and `k` are 3 and `a[i - 1] + 2`, respectively. The value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` is fetched from the array indexed at `[1][3][k]`, and this value is then assigned to `mem[0][3][k]`.

Other variables (`ans`, `i`, `m`) remain unaffected, and we do not have specific values for `mem` or `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `mem[0][3][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][3][k]`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[i - 1] + 2`.

Output State: **`mem[0][3][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][3][k]`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[i - 1] + 2`.**
