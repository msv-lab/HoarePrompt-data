The value at `mem[ix][j][k]` is being updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are 1, 3, and `a[0]`, respectively. The value of `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]` since `i` is 1.

Thus, we need to evaluate the following:
- `mem[1][3][k]` will be updated with the value of `add(mem[1][3][k], mem[1][2][k - a[0]])`.

The previous values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` are not given, but the operation updates `mem[1][3][k]` without changing other variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` is updated at indices [1][3][k] to the value of `add(mem[1][3][k], mem[1][2][k - a[0]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` is updated at indices [1][3][k] to the value of `add(mem[1][3][k], mem[1][2][k - a[0]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[0]`**.
