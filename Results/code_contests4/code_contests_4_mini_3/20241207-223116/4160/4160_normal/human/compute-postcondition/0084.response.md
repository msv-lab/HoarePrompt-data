According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `a`, and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range defined by `a[i - 1]` to `b`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so we look at `a[i - 1]`, which is `a[2]`. The value of `k` is currently `a[2]`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to the next integer, which is `a[2] + 1`. 

Additionally, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must still be less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a[2] + 1` is less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `ix` is 1; `j` is 1; `k` is `a[2] + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.**
