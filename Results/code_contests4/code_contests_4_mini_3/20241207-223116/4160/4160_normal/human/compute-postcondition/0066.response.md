According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, after the last iteration, `j` becomes 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, so `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue. 

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
