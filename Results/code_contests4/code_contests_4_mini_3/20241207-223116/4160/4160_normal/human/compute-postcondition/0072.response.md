The code updates `mem[ix][j][k]` with the result of the `add` function, which takes two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are known, while `a[i - 1]` needs to be calculated using the current value of `i`. 

Given that:
- `ix` is 0,
- `j` is 3,
- `k` is `a[1] + 3`,
- `i` is 2,
- The value of `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`.

Thus, this will lead to:
- `k - a[i - 1]` = `a[1] + 3 - a[1]` = `3`.

Therefore, the expression becomes:
```
mem[0][3][a[1] + 3] = add(mem[0][3][a[1] + 3], mem[0][2][3])
```
The values of `ans`, `i`, and `ix` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mem[0][3][k]` is updated with the value from `add(mem[0][3][k], mem[0][2][3])`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[1] + 3`.**
