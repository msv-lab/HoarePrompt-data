The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `b` is a non-negative integer; `mod` is a positive integer; `a` is the output of rints(); `mem` is a 3D list with dimensions [2][m+1][b+1] where each element is 1 if the index j is 0, otherwise 0; `ans` is 0.
