According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `k`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, the loop is controlled by the range defined by `a[i - 1]` and `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at a value within the range `[a[i - 1], b]`. 

For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` will be `k + 1`. The loop can execute another time if this new value of `k` does not exceed `b`. 

Thus, if the current value of `k` is equal to `b`, the loop cannot execute again. However, if `k` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again with the updated value of `k`.

State: **`mem[0][1][k]` is updated by adding `mem[0][0][k - a[1]]` to it, for the loop to execute one more time k must be incremented to `k + 1`, and it must be less than or equal to b.**
