Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` at indices [0][1][k] is updated to the value of `mem` at indices [1][1][k] for all `k` from `a[1]` to `b`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, and the first iteration of the loop is executed with `k` being `a[1]`.**
