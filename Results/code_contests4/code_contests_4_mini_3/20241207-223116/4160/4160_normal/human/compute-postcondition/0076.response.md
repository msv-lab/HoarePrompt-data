To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop code and its effect on the variables:

- The loop iterates over `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`. 
- During each iteration, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the values from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
- The variable `ans` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as stated.
- The variables `i`, `ix`, and `j` also remain constant throughout the execution of the loop.

Given that the loop executes starting from `k = a[i - 1]` up to `k = b + 1`, the final state of `mem[0][3][k]` will be updated for all `k` in that range. 

If `m >= 3`, the following will hold true after the loop has completed:
- `mem[0][3][k]` contains the sum of the values from `mem[0][2][k - a[i - 1]]` for the respective `k` values.
- The variable `ans` remains 0.
- The values of `i`, `ix`, and `j` remain 2, 0, and 3 respectively.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as follows:

Output State: **`mem[0][3][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[1]` to `b`, `ans` remains 0, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3.**
