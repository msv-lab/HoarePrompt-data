The statement `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. 

Here, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[2]`. The value of `ix ^ 1` will be `0` because `1 XOR 1` equals `0`. Therefore, the assignment is effectively `mem[1][3][k] = mem[0][3][k]`.

The previous value of `mem[1][3][k]` will be updated to whatever value is currently stored at `mem[0][3][k]`. The other variables `ans`, `i`, and `m` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`mem[1][3][k]` is updated to `mem[0][3][k]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is `a[2]`.**
