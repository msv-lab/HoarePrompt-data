The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The variables `ans`, `i`, and `ix` remain unchanged, and `j` is 2. The specific value of `k` is determined by the condition that `k` must be `a[i - 1] + 2` and it must be less than or equal to `b`, but since we do not have specific values for `a[i - 1]` or `b`, we cannot define the exact value of `k`. Therefore, we can only state that `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated based on the previous state of `mem` and the specific values for `k` will depend on the conditions stated.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 2, and `k` must be `a[i - 1] + 2` and it must be less than or equal to `b`.**
