Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` is updated at indices [0][1][k] and [1][1][k] for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[n - 1]` to `b`, `ans` is the sum of `mem[n & 1][m][i]` for `i` from `0` to `b`, and the value of `ans` is printed.**
