The loop iterates for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`, and for each `j`, it iterates over `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`. During these iterations, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the values from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

After the loop has executed for all values of `j` (from 1 to `m`), the final state of the variables is as follows:

- `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[2]` to `b` for each `j` from 1 to `m`, meaning that the matrix `mem[1][1]` to `mem[1][m]` will have been fully updated based on the specified logic of the loop.
- `ans` remains 0 as it was not modified in the loop.
- `i` remains 3 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `ix` remains 1 as it is also not modified in the loop.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `j` until it exceeds `m`.
- The value of `k` will be `b + 1` after the last iteration of the inner loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from `a[2]` to `b`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `ix` is 1; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `b + 1`.**
