The assignment `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` updates the value at `mem[ix][j][k]` with the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `ix` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[1] + 3`. The value of `ix ^ 1` will be 1 because `0 ^ 1` equals `1`. Therefore, the value from `mem[1][3][k]` will be assigned to `mem[0][3][k]`.

The other variables `ans` and `i` remain unchanged, and there are no other computations or updates affecting them.

Thus, the Output State is: `mem[0][3][k]` is updated with the value from `mem[1][3][k]`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[1] + 3`.

Output State: **`mem[0][3][k]` is updated with the value from `mem[1][3][k]`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[1] + 3**.
