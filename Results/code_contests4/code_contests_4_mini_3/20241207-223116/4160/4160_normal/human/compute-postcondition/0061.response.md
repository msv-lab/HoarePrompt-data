To analyze the provided code snippet, we have the following initial state:

- `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`
- `ans` remains 0
- `i` remains 2
- `ix` remains 0
- `j` is 2
- `k` must be `a[i - 1] + 2` and it must be less than or equal to `b`

Upon executing the code:

1. The expression `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` updates `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The specific values of `a[i - 1]`, `k`, and `b` are not provided, but we know `k` is determined by `a[i - 1] + 2` and must be less than or equal to `b`.

2. The variable `mem` is modified, but the specific values before and after the operation are not defined in the provided state.

Therefore, the output state accounts for the updated `mem` and confirms the values of `ans`, `i`, `ix`, and `j`, while noting that `k` has a dependency on the array `a`.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`; `ans` remains 0; `i` remains 2; `ix` remains 0; `j` is 2; `k` is `a[i - 1] + 2` and must be â‰¤ `b`**.
