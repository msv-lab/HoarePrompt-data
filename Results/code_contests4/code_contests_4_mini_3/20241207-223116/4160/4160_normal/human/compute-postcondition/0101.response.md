To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop code and the initial conditions provided.

The loop iterates over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`. Given that `i` is 3, this means the loop will iterate from `a[2]` to `b`. During each iteration, the following operations occur:

1. `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, effectively copying values from the previous state of the `mem` array.
2. Then, the `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated further by adding a value derived from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

After the loop completes:
- `mem[1][2][k]` will hold the values derived from both the previous state and the addition involving `mem[1][1][k - a[2]]` for each `k` in the range.
- The variable `ans` remains 0 throughout since it is not modified in the loop.
- Variables `i`, `ix`, and `j` retain their values of 3, 1, and 2, respectively.
- `k` will be `b + 1` after the final iteration of the loop.

Thus, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`mem[1][2][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[2]` to `b`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b + 1`.**
