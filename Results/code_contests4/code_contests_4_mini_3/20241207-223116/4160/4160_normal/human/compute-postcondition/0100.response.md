The code snippet assigns a value to `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the result of `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`. 

1. The current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated.
2. The function `add` takes two parameters: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 
3. We have the following known values:
   - `ix` is 1
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` is `b + 1`, which is not defined in the initial state.
   - `i` is 3, which means `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]`.
4. For the calculation to proceed, `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` would need to have defined values, but these values are not provided in the initial state.

Therefore, the state of `mem[ix][j][k]` will change with the addition, but we cannot compute the exact values since `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` depend on the contents of the `mem` structure and the value of `a[2]`, which are unknown.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b + 1`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with an addition involving unknown values.**
