The assignment updates `mem[ix][j][k]` to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is not stated, but it will now take on the value from the alternate index of `ix`. The values of `mem[0][1][k]` remain unchanged and the variable `k` continues to control the loop execution based on the condition that it must be less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated, while other specified states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `mem[0][1][k]` remains unchanged, `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.**
