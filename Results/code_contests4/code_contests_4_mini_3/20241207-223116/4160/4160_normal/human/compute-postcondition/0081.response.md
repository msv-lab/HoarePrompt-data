According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `b + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `k` must be less than `b + 1`. 

Given that `i` is 3, we need to check the value of `a[2]` (because `i - 1` is 2). For the loop to execute, we must have:

1. `a[2]` must be less than or equal to `b`.
2. The current value of `k` is `b + 1`, which means the loop will not start if `a[2]` is greater than `b`.

So, for the loop to execute, we must ensure that `a[2]` is less than or equal to `b`. 

The initial state also indicates that `j` is set to 1, which is not directly affecting the loop execution but could be relevant for the context of `mem[ix][j][k]`.

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that `a[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, and we need to set `k` to `a[i - 1]` (or `a[2]`) for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `j` from 1 to `m`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2]`), for the loop to execute the first time `a[2]` is less than or equal to `b`.**
