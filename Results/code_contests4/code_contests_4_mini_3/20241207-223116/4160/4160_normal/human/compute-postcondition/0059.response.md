According to the code, the loop executes for values of `k` starting from `a[i - 1]` up to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is now `a[i - 1] + 1`. This means that `k` has been updated to `a[i - 1] + 1`, which is the next value after `a[i - 1]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `b`, and it will increment by 1 each iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be `a[i - 1] + 2`, and `k` must still be less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be `a[i - 1] + 2` and it must be less than or equal to `b`.**
