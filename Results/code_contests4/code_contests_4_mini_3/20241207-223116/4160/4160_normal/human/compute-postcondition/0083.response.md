The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to its current value using the `add` function. The current values are as follows: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is `a[2]`. The value of `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]` since `i` is 3 (meaning `i - 1` is 2). Thus, `k - a[i - 1]` becomes `a[2] - a[2]`, which equals `0`.

The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will now hold the result of `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][0])`. The states of other variables are not affected in this line, and `ans` remains 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `ix` is 1; `j` is 1; `k` is `a[2]`.
Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `ix` is 1; `j` is 1; `k` is `a[2]`.**
