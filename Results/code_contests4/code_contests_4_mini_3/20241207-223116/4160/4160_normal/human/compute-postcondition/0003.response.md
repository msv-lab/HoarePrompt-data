The values of `n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod` are assigned new values based on the output of the `rints()` lambda function, which reads integers from input. The previous values of these variables are replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod` are now the integers read from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `b` is a non-negative integer; `mod` is a positive integer** (all updated based on input from `rints()`).
