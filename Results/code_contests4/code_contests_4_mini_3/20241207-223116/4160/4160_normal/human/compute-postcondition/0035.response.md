The value at `mem[ix][j][k]` is being assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` will result in 0. The variable `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[0] + 1`. Therefore, `mem[1][3][k]` is being updated to the value of `mem[0][3][k]`. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` at index [1][3][k] is updated to the value of `mem[0][3][k]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[0] + 1**
