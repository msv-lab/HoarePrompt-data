According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `k`, `a[i - 1]`, and `b`. The loop runs for values of `k` starting from `a[i - 1]` up to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at `a[i - 1] + 2`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.

Since `k` was updated to `a[i - 1] + 2`, the next value of `k` for the loop to execute one more time would be `a[i - 1] + 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must now be `a[i - 1] + 3`, and it must still satisfy the condition \( k \leq b \).

Thus, we need to ensure that \( a[i - 1] + 3 \leq b \).

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`; `ans` remains 0; `i` remains 2; `ix` remains 0; `j` is 2; `k` is `a[i - 1] + 3` and must be â‰¤ `b`**
