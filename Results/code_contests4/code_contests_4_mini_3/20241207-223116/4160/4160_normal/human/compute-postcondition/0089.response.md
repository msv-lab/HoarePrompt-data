To simulate the execution of the provided Python code, we need to analyze the impacts of the code snippet given the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `ix` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `k` is `a[2] + 2` (where `a` is an array, but the specific values of `a` are not given)
- `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` based on the `add` function.

```
mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])
```

1. The `add` function takes two arguments: 
   - `mem[ix][j][k]`
   - `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`

2. Since `ix` is 1, we have:
   - `mem[1][1][k]` (where `k` is `a[2] + 2`)
   - `mem[0][1][k - a[i - 1]]` where `i` is 3, thus `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`.

3. The value of `j` is 1, so `j - 1` equals 0.

4. The operation assigns the result of the `add` function to `mem[1][1][k]`. The exact values will depend on the contents of the `mem` array and the `add` function, which have not been provided.

Since the values of `mem` and `a` are not defined, we cannot determine specific numeric values. However, we can state that:

- `mem[1][1][k]` is updated based on the result of the `add` function.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the update without specific numeric values.

Output State: **`ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `ix` is 1; `j` is 1; `k` is `a[2] + 2`; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the `add` function.**
