The expression `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding to it the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `ix` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `k` is `a[2]`
- The value of `a[i - 1]` would be `a[2]` since `i` is 3.

Therefore, `mem[1][3][k]` will be updated with the addition of `mem[1][2][k - a[2]]` to its current value.

The output state reflects the updated value of `mem[ix][j][k]` but does not provide specific values for `mem` or `a`, so we will denote the change without specifying their values.

Output State: **`mem[1][3][k]` is updated by adding `mem[1][2][k - a[2]]` to it, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is `a[2]`.**
