The `mult` lambda function is defined to take two parameters `a` and `b`, and it calculates the product of `a` and `b` modulo `mod`. The initial state of the variables is not changed by this definition, so we only have a new function defined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `b` is a non-negative integer; `mod` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of integers; `add` is a lambda function; `mult` is defined as a lambda function for multiplication modulo `mod`.**
