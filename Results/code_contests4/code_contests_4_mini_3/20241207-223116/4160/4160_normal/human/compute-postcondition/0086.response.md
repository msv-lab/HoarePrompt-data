To evaluate the impact of the provided code, we first need to analyze the variables involved in the assignment and their previous states.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `ix` is 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `k` is `a[2] + 1` (the value of `a[2]` is unknown, so we will denote it as `a[2]`)
   - `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[0][j][k]`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line of code `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` involves several operations:
     - The index `ix` is 1.
     - The index `j` is 1, so `j - 1` becomes 0.
     - The index `k` is `a[2] + 1`.
     - The value `i` is 3, which means `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]`.

3. **Impact**:
   - We need to evaluate `mem[ix][j][k]`, which is `mem[1][1][k]`, and update it with the result of the `add` function.
   - The `add` function takes two arguments:
     - The first argument is `mem[ix][j][k]`, which is `mem[1][1][a[2] + 1]`.
     - The second argument is `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, which translates to `mem[1][0][(a[2] + 1) - a[2]]`, simplifying to `mem[1][0][1]`.

4. **Final State**:
   - The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` (i.e., `mem[1][1][a[2] + 1]`) is updated based on the result of the `add` function combining `mem[1][1][a[2] + 1]` and `mem[1][0][1]`.

Since the values of `mem` and `a` are not explicitly defined, we can only describe the update operation without specific values.

Output State: **`ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `ix` is 1; `j` is 1; `k` is `a[2] + 1`; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the `add` function.**
