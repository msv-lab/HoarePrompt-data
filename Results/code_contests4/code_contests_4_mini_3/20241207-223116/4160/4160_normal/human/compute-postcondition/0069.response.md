To analyze the provided code, we note that the variable `mem` is a multi-dimensional array, and the function `add` is likely defined elsewhere, performing a specific operation based on its inputs.

The code snippet assigns the value of `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. We need to evaluate the indices used in this assignment based on the initial state:

- `ix` is `0`
- `j` is `3`
- `k` is `a[i - 1] + 2`, where `i` is `2`, so `k` becomes `a[1] + 2`

This means we are calculating `mem[0][3][k]` using the result of `add(mem[0][3][k], mem[0][2][k - a[1]])`.

Since `ans`, `i`, and `ix` remain unchanged, we focus on the operation affecting `mem`.

The output state describes the situation after the operation is executed. Since we don't have concrete values for `a`, `mem`, or the result of `add`, we can only describe the operation generically without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`mem[0][3][k]` is updated to `add(mem[0][3][k], mem[0][2][k - a[1]])`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[1] + 2`.**
