The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `m`, `b`, `mod`, and `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of programmers (1 ≤ n ≤ 500).
- `m` is a positive integer representing the number of lines of code to be written (1 ≤ m ≤ 500).
- `b` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum total number of bugs allowed (0 ≤ b ≤ 500).
- `mod` is a positive integer for the modulo operation (1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^9 + 7).
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 500) represents the number of bugs per line for each programmer.

After executing the function body, it calculates the number of ways to assign lines of code to programmers while ensuring that the total number of bugs does not exceed `b` and returns this count modulo `mod`.

Functionality: **The function accepts positive integers `n`, `m`, `b`, `mod`, and a list of integers `a`, and returns the number of ways to assign lines of code to programmers such that the total number of bugs does not exceed `b`, modulo `mod`.**
