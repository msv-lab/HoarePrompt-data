To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the variables involved in the statement.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ans` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `ix` is 0
   - `j` is 3
   - `k` is `a[1] + 4` (the value of `k` depends on the value of `a[1]`)
   - The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated based on the value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

2. **Understanding the Code:**
   - `mem[ix][j][k]` will be assigned a new value based on the result of the `add` function, which combines the current value at `mem[ix][j][k]` with another value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
   - The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` are involved in accessing a multi-dimensional list named `mem`. The specific values stored in `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` will determine the outcome, but they depend on previously defined values in the `mem` structure.

3. **Output Impact:**
   - Since `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[1] + 4`, the output state will reflect that `mem[0][3][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[0][2][k - a[1]]` to the original value at `mem[0][3][k]`.
   - The values of `ans`, `i`, and `ix` do not change due to this operation. However, the value at `mem[0][3][k]` will change based on the `add` function.

Therefore, considering the above analysis:

Output State: **`ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[1] + 4`; `mem[0][3][k]` is updated with the result of `add(mem[0][3][k], mem[0][2][k - a[1]])`**.
