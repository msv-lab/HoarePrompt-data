The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Here, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `b + 1`. The value of `ix ^ 1` is 0 (since 1 XOR 1 equals 0), so the code effectively reads from `mem[0][3][k]` and writes that value to `mem[1][3][k]`. The variable `ans` is unchanged at 0, and the other variables (`i`, `m`, `k`) remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `mem[1][3][k]` is updated based on `mem[0][3][k]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is `b + 1`.

Output State: **`mem[1][3][k]` is updated based on `mem[0][3][k]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is `b + 1`**.
