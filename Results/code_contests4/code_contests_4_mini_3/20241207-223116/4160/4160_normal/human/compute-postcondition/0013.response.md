The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is `a[0]`, which is the first element of `a`. The value of `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 0 since `ix` is 1 (1 XOR 1 = 0). Therefore, the code accesses `mem[0][1][k]` and assigns that value to `mem[1][1][k]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` has been updated at indices [1][1][1], `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1; `k` is `a[0]` and `mem[1][1][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][1][k]`.**
