The statement `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value from the 3D list `mem` at the indices `[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to the indices `[ix][j][k]`. Here, `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 0. 

The values of `j` and `k` are both currently 1, which means we are accessing `mem[0][1][1]` and assigning that value to `mem[1][1][1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged because this assignment does not affect them.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` has been updated at indices [1][1][1], `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` has been updated at indices [1][1][1], `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1.**
