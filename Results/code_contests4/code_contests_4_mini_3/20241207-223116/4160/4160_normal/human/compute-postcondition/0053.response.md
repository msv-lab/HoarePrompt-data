The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it using the `add` function. The previous state of `mem[ix][j][k]` was already updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, while `mem[0][1][k]` remains unchanged. The variable `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, and it must satisfy the condition of being less than or equal to `b` for the loop to continue executing. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `mem[ix][j][k]` is now updated with the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, `mem[0][1][k]` remains unchanged, `k` is now `k + 1`, and `k` must be less than or equal to `b` for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, `mem[0][1][k]` remains unchanged, `k` is now `k + 1`, and `k` must be less than or equal to `b` for the loop to execute again.**
