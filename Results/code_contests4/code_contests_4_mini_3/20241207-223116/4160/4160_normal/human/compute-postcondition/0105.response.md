The code updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. Given that `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `i` is 3, we can evaluate the indices:

- `a[i - 1]` corresponds to `a[2]`, which is within the bounds specified as `a[2]` must be less than or equal to `b`.
- Therefore, `k - a[i - 1]` is valid as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `a[2]`.

The previous values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` are not specified, so we cannot determine specific numerical results for these variables. However, the operation defines the relationship between them.

Thus, the Output State is: `mem[1][3][k]` is updated based on the values of `mem[1][2][k - a[2]]` and the previous value of `mem[1][3][k]` is altered, while other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`mem[1][3][k]` is updated based on `mem[1][2][k - a[2]]`; `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[2]` is less than or equal to `b`.**
