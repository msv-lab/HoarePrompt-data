The value of `ix` is assigned the value of `i & 1`. Here, `i` is 3, so the calculation becomes `3 & 1`, which results in `1`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `b + 1`, and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `b + 1`, and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3.**
