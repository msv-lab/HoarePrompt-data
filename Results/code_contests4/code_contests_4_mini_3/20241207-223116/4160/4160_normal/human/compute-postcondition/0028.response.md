Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` is updated at indices [1][2][k], `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `a[0] + 1`; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to its current value.**
