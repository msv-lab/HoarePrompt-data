According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `b`. Specifically, the loop will iterate over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`, which means the loop will execute if `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`. 

Additionally, for the loop to execute a third time, it is stated that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. The variable `k` will start from `a[i - 1]` and increment until `b`, so the starting value of `k` should be adjusted for the third execution.

To ensure the loop executes for the third time, we need to confirm that:

1. `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`.
2. The current value of `k` should reflect the previous iterations of the loop. 

Assuming the loop has already executed twice, `k` would need to be adjusted to the value it would take at the start of the third execution, which would be `a[i - 1] + 2` (if it started from `a[i - 1]`).

So, to summarize:
- We need to ensure `m >= 3` for the third execution.
- `k` should be `a[i - 1] + 2` at the start of the third iteration.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 2`**
