In the provided code snippet, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is currently 1, hence `ix ^ 1` equals 0 (since 1 XOR 1 is 0). 

The previous state of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated, but we are not given the specific values of `mem` at these indices. The other variables `ans`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Since `k` is defined as `a[2] + 1`, we note that `k` is dependent on the value of `a[2]`, which is not provided. Therefore, while we know that `k` has a specific value based on the array `a`, we cannot define the new state of `k` or `mem` without that information. 

Overall, the output state will reflect that `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated based on the previous state from `mem[0][j][k]`, while the values of the other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `ix` is 1; `j` is 1; `k` is `a[2] + 1`; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[0][j][k]`**
