The value of `ix` is assigned the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and `1`. Since `i` is `1`, the calculation is `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` is a 3D list with dimensions [2][m+1][b+1], `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, and `ix` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `mod` is a positive integer, `a` is the output of rints(), `mem` is a 3D list with dimensions [2][m+1][b+1], `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1**
