According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `k`, `a[i - 1]`, and `b`. The loop is set to iterate starting from `a[i - 1]` to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. The value of `k` is currently `a[1] + 3`, and `j` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `b`. The next value of `k` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to `a[1] + 4`.

Since `ans` remains unchanged at 0 and `i`, `ix`, and `j` do not need to be modified, we focus on adjusting `k`.

State: **`mem[0][3][k]` is updated with the value from `add(mem[0][3][k], mem[0][2][3])`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains 2, `ix` remains 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[1] + 4`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.**
