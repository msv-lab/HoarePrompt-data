According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is 3. The value of `k` has been set to `b + 1`, and `ans` remains 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. 

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[2]` to `b`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `ix` is 1; `j` is 2; `k` is `b + 1`**
