The code snippet defines a lambda function `rints` that reads a line from standard input, splits it into components, and converts each component into an integer. However, this does not affect any of the existing variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `mod`, `a`, `add`, `mult`). The state of the variables remains unchanged, but the `rints` function is now available for use to read integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `b` is a non-negative integer; `mod` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of integers; `add` is a lambda function; `mult` is defined as a lambda function for multiplication modulo `mod`; `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from input.**
