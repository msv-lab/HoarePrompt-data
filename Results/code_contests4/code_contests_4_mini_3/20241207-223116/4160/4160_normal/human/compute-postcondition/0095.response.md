According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, meaning `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`. The loop will execute again if `k` is still within the specified range. 

Given that `k` starts at `a[2]` and the loop increments `k` by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be equal to `b`, as the next value of `k` will be `b + 1`, at which point the loop will stop executing.

Thus, `k` needs to be adjusted to `b` for the loop to execute a second time. 

State: **`mem[1][2][k]` is updated to `mem[0][2][k]` for all `k` from `a[2]` to `b`; `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is `b` for the loop to execute a second time.**
