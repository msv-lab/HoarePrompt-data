You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The city park of IT City contains n east to west paths and n north to south paths. Each east to west path crosses each north to south path, so there are n2 intersections.

The city funded purchase of five benches. To make it seems that there are many benches it was decided to place them on as many paths as possible. Obviously this requirement is satisfied by the following scheme: each bench is placed on a cross of paths and each path contains not more than one bench.

Help the park administration count the number of ways to place the benches.

Input

The only line of the input contains one integer n (5 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of east to west paths and north to south paths.

Output

Output one integer — the number of ways to place the benches.

Examples

Input

5


Output

120
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, and a is not utilized in the function based on the problem description.
def func_1(n, a):
    r = 1
    s = 1
    p = n
    g = 1
    for i in range(a):
        r = r * p
        
        p -= 1
        
        s = s * g
        
        g += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n!` (the factorial of `n`); `s` is equal to the sum of the first (a-1) integers; `g` is equal to `a`; `p` is equal to `n - a + 1`.
    return r / s
    #The program returns the value of r (n!) divided by s (the sum of the first (a-1) integers)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
