The variable `r` is assigned the value `r * p`. The initial value of `r` is equal to `n`, and `p` is equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, after the execution, `r` will be updated to `n * (n - 1)`. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `g`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. 

The output state will reflect the updated value of `r` in terms of `n`. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `g` is 2; `p` is equal to `n - 1; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1, i is incremented by 1**.
