The variable `g` is assigned the value of 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `r`, `a`, `s`, `p`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is 1; `a` is not utilized; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n`; `g` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is 1; `a` is not utilized; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n`; `g` is 1**
