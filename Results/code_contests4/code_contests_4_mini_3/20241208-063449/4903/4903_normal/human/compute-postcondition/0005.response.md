The value of `r` is updated to `r * p`. Given that `r` is initially 1 and `p` is equal to `n`, the new value of `r` will be `1 * n`, which is simply `n`. The other variables (`s`, `g`, and any conditions regarding `a`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `g` is 1; `p` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `g` is 1; `p` is equal to `n**
