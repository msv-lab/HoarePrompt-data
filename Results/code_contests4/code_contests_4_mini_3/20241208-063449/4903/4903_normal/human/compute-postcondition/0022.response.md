Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 5 <= n <= 100) and another integer `a`, and calculates the value of n! (the factorial of n) divided by the sum of the first (a-1) integers. The function does not handle cases where `a` is 0 or 1, which would result in division by zero or an incorrect sum, respectively. If `a` is less than or equal to 1, the behavior is not defined as the sum would be zero or negative. Therefore, the function may produce unexpected results for values of `a` that are 0 or 1.**
