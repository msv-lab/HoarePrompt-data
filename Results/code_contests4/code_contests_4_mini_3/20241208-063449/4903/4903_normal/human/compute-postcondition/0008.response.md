The value of `g` is incremented by 1, and since `g` is initially 1, after execution, `g` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `g` is 2; `p` is equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `g` is 2; `p` is equal to `n - 1**
