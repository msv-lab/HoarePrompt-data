The value of `g` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `g` was 2, so after the execution, `g` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `p` is equal to `n - 2; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1, i is incremented by 1.
