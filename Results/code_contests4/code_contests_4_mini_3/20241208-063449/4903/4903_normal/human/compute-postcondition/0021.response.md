The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 5 <= n <= 100. The parameter `a` is not utilized in the function. After executing the function body, it calculates the factorial of `n` (denoted as n!) and divides it by the sum of the first (a-1) integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return the value of n! divided by the sum of the first (a-1) integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (an integer between 5 and 100) and returns the value of n! divided by the sum of the first (a-1) integers.**
