The variable `p` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `p` is `n - 1`, which means after execution, `p` will be `n - 2`. The other variables `n`, `r`, `s`, `g`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `g` is 2; `p` is equal to `n - 2; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1, i is incremented by 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `g` is 2; `p` is equal to `n - 2; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1, i is incremented by 1.**
