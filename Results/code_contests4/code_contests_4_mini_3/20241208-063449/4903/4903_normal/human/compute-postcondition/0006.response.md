The value of `p` is decremented by 1. Since `p` is equal to `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100, the new value of `p` becomes `n - 1`. The other variables `n`, `r`, `s`, and `g` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `g` is 1; `p` is equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `g` is 1; `p` is equal to `n - 1**
