The variable `s` is assigned the value of `s * g`. Given that `s` is 2 and `g` is 3, the calculation results in `s` now being equal to 6. Other variables (`n`, `r`, `p`, `i`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `(n * (n - 1)) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 6; `g` is 3; `p` is now equal to `n - 3`; `i` is incremented by 1; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1.**
