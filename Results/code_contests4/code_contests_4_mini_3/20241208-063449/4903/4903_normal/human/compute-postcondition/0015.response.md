The value of `r` is updated by multiplying it by `p`. Given that `r` is initially `n * (n - 1)` and `p` is `n - 2`, the new value of `r` becomes `(n * (n - 1)) * (n - 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `(n * (n - 1)) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `p` is equal to `n - 2`; `i` is incremented by 1; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1`.
