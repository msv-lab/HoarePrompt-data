According to the code, the loop can execute again if `a` is greater than `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is now equal to the previous value plus 1. 

Since `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100, `p` is equal to `n - 2`, and the initial value of `i` is incremented by 1, we need to set `i` to its new value and ensure that `a` is greater than this new `i`. 

Thus, if `i` was initially `k`, after incrementing `i`, it becomes `k + 1`. For the loop to run again, we need `a` to be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `p` is equal to `n - 2`; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1, i is incremented by 1`**
