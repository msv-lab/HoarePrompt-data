`p` is assigned the value of `n`, which is an integer within the range of 5 to 100. The values of the other variables `r`, `a`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `a` is not utilized; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `a` is not utilized; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n**
