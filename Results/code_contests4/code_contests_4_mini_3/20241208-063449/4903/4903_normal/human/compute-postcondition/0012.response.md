The value of `s` is updated by multiplying it with `g`. Given that `g` is 2, the new value of `s` becomes `s * g`, which is `1 * 2 = 2`. The values of `n`, `r`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 2; `p` is equal to `n - 2; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1, i is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 2; `p` is equal to `n - 2; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1, i is incremented by 1.**
