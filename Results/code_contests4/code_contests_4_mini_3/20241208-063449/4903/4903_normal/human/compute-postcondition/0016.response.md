The value of `p` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `p` is `n - 2`, so after the execution, `p` will be `n - 3`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `r`, `s`, `g`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `(n * (n - 1)) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `p` is now equal to `n - 3`; `i` is incremented by 1; for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than `i + 1`.
