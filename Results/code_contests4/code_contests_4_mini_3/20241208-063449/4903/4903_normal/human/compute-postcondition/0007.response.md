`The value of s` is updated to `s * g`. Given that `s` is 1 and `g` is 1, the new value of `s` remains 1. The other variables (`n`, `r`, `g`, and `p`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `g` is 1; `p` is equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `g` is 1; `p` is equal to `n - 1**
