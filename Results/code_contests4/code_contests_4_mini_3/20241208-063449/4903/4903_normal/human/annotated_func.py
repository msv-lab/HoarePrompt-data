#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, and a is not utilized in the function based on the problem description.
def func_1(n, a):
    r = 1
    s = 1
    p = n
    g = 1
    for i in range(a):
        r = r * p
        
        p -= 1
        
        s = s * g
        
        g += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to `n!` (the factorial of `n`); `s` is equal to the sum of the first (a-1) integers; `g` is equal to `a`; `p` is equal to `n - a + 1`.
    return r / s
    #The program returns the value of r (n!) divided by s (the sum of the first (a-1) integers)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 5 <= n <= 100) and another integer `a`, and calculates the value of n! (the factorial of n) divided by the sum of the first (a-1) integers. The function does not handle cases where `a` is 0 or 1, which would result in division by zero or an incorrect sum, respectively. If `a` is less than or equal to 1, the behavior is not defined as the sum would be zero or negative. Therefore, the function may produce unexpected results for values of `a` that are 0 or 1.
