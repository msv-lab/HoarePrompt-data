To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and check if it meets the requirements of identifying a "good" level in the game "King of Thieves".

**Requirements**:
The level is considered "good" if there exists a sequence of five platforms (represented by '*') such that the intervals between consecutive platforms are the same.

**Program Analysis**:
1. The outer loop iterates over possible jump lengths `j` starting from 1.
2. The inner loop iterates over all possible starting positions `i`.
3. The condition checks if the 5 platforms at indices `i`, `i+j`, `i+2*j`, `i+3*j`, and `i+4*j` are all '*'.
4. If such a sequence is found, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

**Potential Cases to Consider**:
1. **Minimum Input Edge Case**: For `n = 1`, the only string possible is either `'*'` or `'.'`. In both cases, the program should output `"no"` since there aren't enough segments to form the required sequence.

2. **All Platforms Case**: For example, with `n = 5` and `s = "*****"`, the program should output `"yes"` because the platforms at indices `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` can be jumped in equal intervals.

3. **Non-Sequential Platforms**: The program should correctly identify cases where platforms do not align for jumps. For example, for `n = 10` and `s = "*.**.*...*"`, the output should be `"no"`.

4. **Valid Jump Sequence**: For `n = 16` and `s = ".**.*..*.***.**."`, the program correctly identifies the jump sequence and outputs `"yes"`.

5. **Equal Gaps Handling**: Testing with strings like `n = 10` and `s = "*...*...*"`, the program should output `"no"` as there aren't five platforms in a valid jump sequence.

**Finding a Failing Case**:
Upon careful review, the condition `i + 4 * j < len(s)` might lead to overlooking some valid configurations because it checks only for a maximum index without validating if there are enough positions between them that are platforms.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 10
s = "*.*.*.*.*"
```
In this case, the program will not detect the valid sequence of jumps (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) because the jump length `j` must be chosen appropriately and the program does not account for the jump length checks correctly to find valid sequences.

Given these considerations, the program fails to identify certain configurations accurately.

Correctness: **False**.
