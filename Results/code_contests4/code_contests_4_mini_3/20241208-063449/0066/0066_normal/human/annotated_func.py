#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) consisting of characters '*' and '.', where '*' represents a platform and '.' represents a pit.
def func_1(s):
    for j in xrange(1, len(s)):
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
            if i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j
                ] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*':
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `len(s)`, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1` if the loop completes without finding a match, and the program will return True if there exists at least one index `i` such that `i + 4 * j < len(s)` and `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, and `s[i + 4 * j]` are all equal to '*'. If no such index exists, the function returns None.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the condition for at least one index `i` with the specified criteria is not met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` of length between 1 and 100, consisting of characters '*' and '.'. It checks for any index `i` such that the characters at `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` are all equal to '*', returning True if such an index exists. If no such index is found after all iterations, the function returns False. The function does not handle cases where `s` has less than 5 characters, which could also lead to False but may not be explicitly stated in the annotations.
