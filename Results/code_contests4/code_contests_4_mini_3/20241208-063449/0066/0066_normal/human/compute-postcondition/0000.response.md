According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and its length. The loop starts at `j = 1` and runs until `j` is less than the length of `s`. Since `s` has a length of at least 1 (n ≥ 1), the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute because there is no second character to iterate over.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to check that `n` is at least 2. At the start of the loop, `j` will be 1.

State: **`s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
