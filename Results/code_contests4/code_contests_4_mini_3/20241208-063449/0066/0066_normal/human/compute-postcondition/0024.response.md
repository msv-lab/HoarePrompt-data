According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `1` to `len(s)`, which means that for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not equal to `len(s)`, and since the loop is currently using `xrange`, we know `j` has been incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, if `j` was `k` in the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.

Since `j` is not equal to `len(s)`, it must be adjusted to `j + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it `j + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `i` is equal to `len(s)`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and for the loop to execute a second time, it must hold that `j + 1` is less than `len(s)`**.
