Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `len(s)`, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1` if the loop completes without finding a match, and the program will return True if there exists at least one index `i` such that `i + 4 * j < len(s)` and `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, and `s[i + 4 * j]` are all equal to '*'. If no such index exists, the function returns None.**
