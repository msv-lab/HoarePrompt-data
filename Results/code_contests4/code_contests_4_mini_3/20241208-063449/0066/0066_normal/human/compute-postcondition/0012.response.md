According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(s) - 1`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `len(s)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(s)` if the loop completes without finding a match. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `len(s) - 1`. 

Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, if the loop has not found a match, it means the last value of `j` would be `len(s) - 1`, and then `j` would be equal to `len(s)` when the loop completes. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be `len(s)` which is not possible as the loop condition is `j < len(s)`. Hence, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is equal to `len(s)`, the loop will not execute again since `j` will be equal to `len(s)`**.
