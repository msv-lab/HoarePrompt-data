According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the string `s`, which has a length `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as the index `i` is less than `len(s)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is greater than 0, `len(s)` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since the loop is structured to execute for each index of `s`, after the current iteration where `i` is 0, the next value of `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `len(s)`, which means `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
