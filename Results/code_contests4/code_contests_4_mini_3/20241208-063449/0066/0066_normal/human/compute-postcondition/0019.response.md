Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is not equal to `len(s)`. If `i + 4 * j` is less than `len(s)` and the characters `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, and `s[i + 4 * j]` are all equal to '*', the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
