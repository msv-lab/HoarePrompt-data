Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `i` is now 0, `j` is adjusted to ensure that `j + 1 < len(s) for the loop to execute a second time. It is not the case that `i + 4 * j < len(s)` and `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, and `s[i + 4 * j]` are all equal to '*'.***
