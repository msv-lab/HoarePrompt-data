Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n`, where `n` is greater than 1. If `i + 4 * j` is less than the length of `s` and the characters at positions `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` in `s` are all equal to '*', the program returns True, indicating that the execution of the code is successful.***
