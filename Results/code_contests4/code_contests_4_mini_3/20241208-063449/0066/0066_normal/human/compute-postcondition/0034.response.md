Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is adjusted such that `j + 1 < len(s)`. If `i + 4 * j` is less than the length of `s` and the characters at indices `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` are all equal to '*', then the program returns True. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
