Output State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `i` is equal to `len(s)`, `j` has been adjusted to ensure that `j + 1` is no longer less than `len(s)`, and the function returns True if there exists at least one index `i` such that `i + 4 * j < len(s)` and `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, and `s[i + 4 * j]` are all equal to '*'. If no such index exists, the function returns None.**
