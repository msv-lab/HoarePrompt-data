The function accepts a string `s` of length between 1 and 100, consisting of characters '*' and '.'. It checks for any index `i` such that the characters at `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` are all equal to '*', returning True if such an index exists. If no such index is found after all iterations, the function returns False. The function does not handle cases where `s` has less than 5 characters, which could also lead to False but may not be explicitly stated in the annotations.
