To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
The program needs to determine the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation (`start`) to the second permutation (`end`). The only operation allowed is to remove the last element of `start` and insert it back into any position in the permutation.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` and two lists of integers (`start` and `end`).
2. **Mapping Indices**: It creates two dictionaries (`start_m` and `end_m`) that map each number in the permutations to its index.
3. **Calculating Moves**: The program then calculates the difference in indices for each number from `start` to `end`. If the difference is negative, it adjusts the count by considering how many moves it would take if the number needs to wrap around (since it can be removed from the end).
4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum number of moves calculated for any number is stored in `res` and printed at the end.

### Potential Issues:
Let's consider the logic for calculating the minimum number of moves. The code calculates the number of moves based on the index positions but does not account for the fact that if elements are already in the correct relative order in `start` compared to `end`, this could reduce the number of necessary moves.

#### Example to Consider:
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
5
1 3 2 5 4
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case:
- The `start` permutation is `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]`.
- The `end` permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

The expected output should be `3`, as follows:
- Move `4` after `5` (1 move).
- Move `5` after `2` (2 moves).
- Move `2` after `1` (3 moves).

However, according to the logic of the program:
- For `1`: `i1 = 0`, `i2 = 0` -> `n_moves = 0`.
- For `3`: `i1 = 1`, `i2 = 2` -> `n_moves = 1`.
- For `2`: `i1 = 2`, `i2 = 1` -> `n_moves = -1` -> adjusted to `4` (since `n=5`, `n_moves = 4`).
- For `5`: `i1 = 3`, `i2 = 3` -> `n_moves = 0`.
- For `4`: `i1 = 4`, `i2 = 4` -> `n_moves = 0`.

The maximum `n_moves` calculated is `4`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for the required number of moves needed to rearrange the elements according to the `end` permutation, as demonstrated by the test case. Thus, the program fails for at least one input case.

Correctness: **False**
