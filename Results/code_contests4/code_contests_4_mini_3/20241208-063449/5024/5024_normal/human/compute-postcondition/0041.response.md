The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on two predefined lists: the first permutation and the second permutation, which are both lists of integers. These lists contain exactly the numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. The function's output is determined by comparing these two permutations. 

Given the provided information, the functionality of the function is as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates on two permutations of integers from 1 to n, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and it produces a result based on the comparison of these two permutations.**
