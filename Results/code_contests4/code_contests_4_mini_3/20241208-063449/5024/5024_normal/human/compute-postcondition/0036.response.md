The value of `n_moves` is assigned the value of `n - i1`. The initial state indicates that `n_moves` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n_moves`, but since we are directly assigning to `n_moves`, the previous value is overwritten. The affected variables are `n_moves` and `i1`, while the initial state provides that `n` exists. The output state will reflect the new value of `n_moves` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`n_moves` is assigned the value of `n - i1`**
