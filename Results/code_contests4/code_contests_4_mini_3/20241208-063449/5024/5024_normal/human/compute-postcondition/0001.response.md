The variable `start` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that converts each element of the input from `sys.stdin.readline()` into an integer. Since the input is a string of integers separated by spaces, the `start` will contain those integers as elements in a list. The previous value of `n` is not directly affected, as it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers from input**.
