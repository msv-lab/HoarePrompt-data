Postcondition: ***`res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n_moves`. If `n_moves` is less than 0, `n_moves` is calculated as `n - i1`, with `start_m` containing at least `m + 1` items, and `i1` as the next index in `start_m`, while `i2` is assigned the value from `end_m` at index `v1`.***
