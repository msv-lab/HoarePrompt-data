According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `end`. The loop will iterate over the elements in `end`, and since at the end of the last iteration, `end` has at least one element, it indicates that the loop has executed at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, `index` corresponds to the current position in the `end` list, and `val` is the current value from the `end` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the `index` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `index` will be the next index in the `end` list.

Since `end` has at least one element, to execute the loop again, `end` must have at least 2 elements, so that `index` can become 1. 

Thus, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each unique value in `start` to its corresponding index in the list; `end_m` now contains the mapping of `val` to `index`; `end` is a list with at least 2 elements, `val` is the second element in the list, `index` is 1.**
