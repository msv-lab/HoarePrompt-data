According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `end` variable, which is not defined in the provided state. The loop iterates over `end`, so it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The values of `n`, `start`, `start_m`, and `end_m` do not directly influence whether the loop will execute, but they set up the context. 

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `end` should be defined as a list or iterable with at least one element. Thus, `end` could be an empty list or any other iterable. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute the first time, `end` must be a list with at least one element, and the initial variables remain the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each unique value in `start` to its corresponding index in the list; `end_m` is an empty dictionary; for the loop to execute the first time, `end` is a list with at least one element.**
