The value of `n_moves` is assigned the result of `n - i1`. The previous value of `i1` is known as it is the next index in `start_m`, while `n` has a specific value which can be used for the calculation. The value of `n_moves` will now depend on the specific values of `n` and `i1`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n_moves`, `start_m` has at least `m + 1` items, `v1` is the next value in the iteration, `i1` is the next index in `start_m`, `i2` is assigned the value from `end_m` at index `v1`, and `n_moves` is now calculated as `n - i1`.
