According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `start_m` dictionary. The loop will execute for each unique value in `start_m`, which means that `start_m` must contain at least one entry for the loop to run. The variables `v1` and `i1` will represent the key and value of the first entry in `start_m` when the loop executes for the first time.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to check that `start_m` is not empty. Assuming `start_m` has at least one entry, `v1` will be the first unique value in `start`, and `i1` will be its corresponding index.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `start_m` contains at least one entry, and we can set `v1` and `i1` to the first key-value pair from `start_m`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `start` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `end_m` contains the mapping of each unique value in `end` to its corresponding index, `end` is a list with `n` elements, `res` is initialized to 0, `v1` is the first key in `start_m`, `i1` is the corresponding index for `v1` in `start_m`.**
