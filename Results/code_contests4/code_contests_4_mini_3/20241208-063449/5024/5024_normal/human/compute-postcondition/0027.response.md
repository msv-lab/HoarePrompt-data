According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the items in `start_m`. If `start_m` has more items, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has been updated to the maximum of its current value and `n_moves`, which is based on the value of `i1`. Since the loop is iterating over the items of `start_m`, we need to determine the next item in the iteration.

If `start_m` originally had `m` items and `i1` corresponds to the current iteration index, then for the loop to execute one more time, `start_m` must have at least `m + 1` items. The next values of `v1` and `i1` will correspond to the next item in the dictionary.

Assuming the loop has executed for all items up to the `m-th` item, the next iteration would involve the `m+1-th` item (if it exists).

State: **`res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n_moves`, for the loop to execute one more time `start_m` must have at least `m + 1` items, `v1` is the next value in the iteration, `i1` is the next index in `start_m`**
