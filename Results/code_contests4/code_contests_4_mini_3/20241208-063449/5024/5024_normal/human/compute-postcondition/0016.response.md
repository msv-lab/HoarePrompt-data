According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `end` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute once more for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `end` has at least 2 elements, `val` is the second element in the list, and `index` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements, `index` will be 2, and `val` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each unique value in `start` to its corresponding index in the list; `end_m` now contains the mapping of `val` to `index`, `end` is a list with at least 3 elements, `val` is the third element in the list, `index` is 2**
