To determine the output state, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved. 

- The code snippet calculates `n_moves` by subtracting `i1` from `i2`.
- Here, `i1` is the index of the first key `v1` in the `start_m` dictionary, and `i2` is the index of `v1` in the `end_m` dictionary.
- Since `n`, `start`, `end`, and `res` are not directly influenced by this line of code, they remain unchanged.

Given that `i1` and `i2` are defined and `n_moves` is calculated as `i2 - i1`, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the new computation for `n_moves`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary with at least one entry; `end_m` contains the mapping of each unique value in `end` to its corresponding index; `end` is a list with `n` elements; `res` is initialized to 0; `v1` is the first key in `start_m`; `i1` is the corresponding index for `v1` in `start_m`; `i2` is the index of `v1` in `end_m`; `n_moves` is calculated as `i2 - i1`.**
