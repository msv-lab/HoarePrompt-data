The value of `n_moves` is assigned the result of `i2 - i1`. The value of `i2` is determined by the value from `end_m` at index `v1`, and `i1` is the next index in `start_m`. Since `start_m` has at least `m + 1` items, `i1` is a valid index. Thus, `n_moves` will be calculated as the difference between `i2` and `i1`. The states of other variables (`res`, `start_m`, `v1`, `i2`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n_moves`, `start_m` has at least `m + 1` items, `v1` is the next value in the iteration, `i1` is the next index in `start_m`; `i2` is assigned the value from `end_m` at index `v1`; `n_moves` is calculated as `i2 - i1`.**
