The value of `n_moves` is assigned the result of the expression `i2 - i1`. The value of `i2` is already known since it has been assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`, but the value of `i1` is not specified. Therefore, `n_moves` will be dependent on the unknown value of `i1`. The variable `res` is not directly affected by this line of code, and the states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n_moves`; for the loop to execute one more time, `start_m` must have at least `k + 1` items; `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`; `n_moves` is assigned the value of `i2 - i1`.**
