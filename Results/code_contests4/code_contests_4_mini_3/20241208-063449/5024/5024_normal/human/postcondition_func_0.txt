The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two permutations of integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates and returns the maximum number of moves required to align the indices of the elements in the first permutation (`start`) with those in the second permutation (`end`). The moves are calculated based on the difference in indices, considering wrapping around the list as needed.
