Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function is intended to compute the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second. However, the logic implemented in the function is flawed because it calculates the maximum number of moves needed based on the differences in indices between the two permutations, rather than determining the minimum number of moves necessary to achieve the transformation.

In particular, the program calculates the index difference `n_moves` for each element in `start` and keeps track of the maximum of these values in `res`. This approach does not accurately reflect the number of moves required. For example, if the elements are not in the same relative order as in the target permutation, the program will fail to account for the necessary moves correctly.

A correct implementation would need to determine how many elements from the end of the first permutation can remain in place when transformed to match the second permutation, and then compute how many moves are required to reposition the remaining elements. The current implementation does not capture this logic and can lead to incorrect results. 

For example, given the input:
```
5
1 5 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```
The correct output is `3`, as it requires three moves to shift `5` to the correct position. However, the logic in the provided code could result in a different value based on the maximum index difference, thus failing to meet the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect in its implementation and logic.
