To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program calculates the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses.

### Program Analysis:
```python
l = input()
p = input()
q = input()
print(float(l) / (p + q)) * p
```

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the length of the corridor `l` and speeds `p` and `q` as strings from standard input. Since these values are coming from `input()`, they need to be converted to integers or floats before performing mathematical operations.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{l}{p + q}\right) \times p
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the time taken for the spells to meet for the first time is \( \frac{l}{p + q} \) and during this time, Harry's spell travels a distance of \( p \times \text{time} \).

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not convert the inputs `l`, `p`, and `q` from strings to integers or floats before using them in calculations. This will lead to a `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations since the default type of input from `input()` is a string.
  
- **Missing Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `p` or `q` equal zero. However, given the problem constraints (1 ≤ p, q ≤ 500), this specific case won't occur. But still, the lack of conversion means the program will not work correctly for any input.

### Example of Failure:
If we run the program with inputs:
```
100
50
50
```
The expected output would be `50.0`. However, because the program does not convert `l`, `p`, and `q` to integers (or floats), it will result in an error when trying to perform the calculation.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to correctly handle input types and will raise an error during execution, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
