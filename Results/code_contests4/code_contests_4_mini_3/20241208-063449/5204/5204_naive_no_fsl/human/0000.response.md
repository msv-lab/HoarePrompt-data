To verify the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze the code and see if it adheres to the problem description.

The program reads three inputs:
1. `l` - the length of the corridor
2. `p` - the speed of Harry's magic spell
3. `q` - the speed of You-Know-Who's magic spell

The formula used in the program is:
```python
print(float(l) / (p + q)) * p
```
This formula calculates the distance from Harry's position to the point of the first collision of the spells based on the principle of relative speeds. 

### Understanding the Problem
The first collision happens at:
\[ \text{distance}_{1} = \frac{l \cdot p}{p + q} \]

After the first collision, the two spells collide again at the same point after returning to their casters and being reflected. Therefore, the second collision will also occur at the same point, which is:
\[ \text{distance}_{2} = \text{distance}_{1} = \frac{l \cdot p}{p + q} \]

### Analyzing Code Calculation
The code correctly calculates the distance from Harry's position to the place of the first and second collision as:
\[ \text{distance} = \frac{l \cdot p}{p + q} \]
This is exactly what is required by the problem statement.

### Edge Cases
- If `p` or `q` is zero, it would indicate that one of the spells does not move. However, the problem states that the speeds are at least 1, so this case will not occur.
- The values of `l`, `p`, and `q` are within the specified limits (1 ≤ l ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ p, q ≤ 500), so there are no concerns about invalid input.

### Conclusion
Since the program correctly implements the logic for calculating the distance to the second meeting point of the spells and handles the defined range of inputs properly according to the problem description, we can conclude that there are no missing logical cases.

Correctness: **True**
