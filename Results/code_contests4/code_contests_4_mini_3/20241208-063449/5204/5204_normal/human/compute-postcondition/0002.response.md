The variable `q` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will take a string input from the user. The previous values of `l` and `p` remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is assigned the value of the input string; `p` is an input string; `q` is an input string.

Output State: **`l` is assigned the value of the input string; `p` is an input string; `q` is an input string.**
