`p` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input string. The variable `l` remains unchanged as it holds the previous value assigned to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is assigned the value of the input string; `p` is an input string.

Output State: **`l` is assigned the value of the input string; `p` is an input string**
