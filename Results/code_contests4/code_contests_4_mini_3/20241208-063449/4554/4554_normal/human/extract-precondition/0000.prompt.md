You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Another Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered n participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant i is a_i. These rating changes are perfectly balanced — their sum is equal to 0.

Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared semi-rated. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.

There are two conditions though: 

  * For each participant i, their modified rating change b_i must be integer, and as close to (a_i)/(2) as possible. It means that either b_i = ⌊ (a_i)/(2) ⌋ or b_i = ⌈ (a_i)/(2) ⌉. In particular, if a_i is even, b_i = (a_i)/(2). Here ⌊ x ⌋ denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than x, and ⌈ x ⌉ denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than x. 
  * The modified rating changes must be perfectly balanced — their sum must be equal to 0. 



Can you help with that?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 13 845), denoting the number of participants.

Each of the next n lines contains a single integer a_i (-336 ≤ a_i ≤ 1164), denoting the rating change of the i-th participant.

The sum of all a_i is equal to 0.

Output

Output n integers b_i, each denoting the modified rating change of the i-th participant in order of input.

For any i, it must be true that either b_i = ⌊ (a_i)/(2) ⌋ or b_i = ⌈ (a_i)/(2) ⌉. The sum of all b_i must be equal to 0.

If there are multiple solutions, print any. We can show that a solution exists for any valid input.

Note

In the first example, b_1 = 5, b_2 = -3 and b_3 = -2 is another correct solution.

In the second example there are 6 possible solutions, one of them is shown in the example output.
