The value of `x` is appended to the list `a`. Since `a` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `a` will contain the value of `x`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `a` is a list containing `x`; `i` is 0; `x` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `a` is a list containing `x`; `i` is 0; `x` is an input integer**
