The value of `b` is updated by appending the value of `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is an even integer, it is added to the list `b`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an even integer; `b` is updated to include the element `a[i]`; `count` is an even integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an even integer; `b` is updated to include the element `a[i]`; `count` is an even integer.**
