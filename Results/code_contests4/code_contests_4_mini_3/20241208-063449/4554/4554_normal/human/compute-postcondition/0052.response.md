Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is `n - 1`; `b` is a list containing the values of half of all elements from `a`, where even elements are halved and odd elements are halved with an increment of 1 based on their count in `a`; `count` is the number of odd integers in `a`. The output of `print(b)` is the list `b`.**
