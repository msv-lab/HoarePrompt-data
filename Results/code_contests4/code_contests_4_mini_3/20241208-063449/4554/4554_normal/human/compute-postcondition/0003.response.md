The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `x` is newly assigned, the values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `a` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `x` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `a` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `x` is an input integer**
