`a` is a list that currently contains the value `x`. The code `a.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the list `a`. Since `x` is an input integer, the list `a` will now contain two instances of `x`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `a` is a list containing `x` and another `x`; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `a` is a list containing `x` and another `x`; `i` is 1**
