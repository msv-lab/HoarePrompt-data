The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an input and convert it to an integer. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `a` is a list containing `x`; `i` is 1; `x` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `a` is a list containing `x`; `i` is 1; `x` is an input integer.**
