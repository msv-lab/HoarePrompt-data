The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of all other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 1, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 1, and `count` is increased by 1**
