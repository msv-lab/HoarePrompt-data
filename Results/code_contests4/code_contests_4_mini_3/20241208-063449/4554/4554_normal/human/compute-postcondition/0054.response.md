Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n`, where `n` is between 2 and 13845, and subsequently reads `n` integers from the input, which are each constrained between -336 and 1164, with their total sum equal to 0. It processes these integers by halving even integers directly and halving odd integers with an adjustment based on their order of appearance, storing the results in a new list `b`. The function then prints the list `b`, which contains the processed values of half of all elements from the input list. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the output. **
