Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer, and if `count` is an even integer, `b` is updated to include the element `a[i]`, which is now an even integer. If `count` is odd, `count` remains an odd integer, and `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] / 2`, which is still an integer.***
