According to the code, the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 13845\), for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` will be 2). 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be updated to 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 to allow the loop to execute once more.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 2**
