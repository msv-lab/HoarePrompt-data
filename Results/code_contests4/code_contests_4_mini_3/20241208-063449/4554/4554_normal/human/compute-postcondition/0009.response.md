`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the output state reflects that `x` now holds an input integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `a` is a list containing `x` and another `x`, `i` is 2, and `x` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `a` is a list containing `x` and another `x`, `i` is 2, and `x` is an input integer.**
