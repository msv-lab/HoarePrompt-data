The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000) that represents the number of abbreviated names, followed by `n` non-empty sequences of lowercase Latin letters. It constructs a 26x26 matrix `dyn` where each entry `dyn[first][last]` holds the maximum length of strings that start with the character corresponding to `first` and end with the character corresponding to `last`. Finally, it calculates and prints the maximum length of strings that both start and end with the same character (i.e., `dyn[i][i]` for each character), effectively finding the longest abbreviated name that starts and ends with the same letter. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, as it assumes valid input based on the constraints.
