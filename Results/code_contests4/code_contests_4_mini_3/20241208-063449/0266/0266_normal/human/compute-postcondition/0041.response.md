The value of `dyn[j][last]` is assigned the result of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. The previous values indicate that `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, and `len(s)` is the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, `dyn[j][last]` will be updated based on the values of `dyn[j][first]` and the length of `s`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 2, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - 97`, `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), `j` is 0, `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`**
