According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute for values of `j` from 0 to 25. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, `j` will be 1 in the next iteration. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `first`, `last`) remain unaffected by the loop control variable `j` in this context.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 2, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - 97`, `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), j is 1**
