According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of values for `j`. The loop iterates over the range of 26, which means `j` can take values from 0 to 25. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` must be incremented to check for the next iteration. 

Since the last iteration has completed with `j` being 0, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 26. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `first` is ord(s[0]) - ord('a'), `last` is ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), and for the loop to execute a second time `dyn[1][first]` must be greater than 0 to update `dyn[1][last]`.**
