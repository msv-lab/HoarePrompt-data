According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which iterates over a range of 26. If `j` is less than 25, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2. The loop will execute for `j` values from 0 to 25.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `first` is ord(s[0]) - ord('a'), `last` is ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a third time.**
