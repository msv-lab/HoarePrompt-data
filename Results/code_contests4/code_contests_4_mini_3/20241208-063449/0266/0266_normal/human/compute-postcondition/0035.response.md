According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` will be 2).

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
