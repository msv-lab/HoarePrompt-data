According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and the loop runs for `j` from 0 to 25 (representing the 26 letters of the alphabet), the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than 26.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be increased to 2. 

The state of the input string `s` and the calculated values `first` and `last` does not change in this context, as they are based on the input string and are not dependent on the loop iteration. Thus, they remain the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 2, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - 97`, `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), j is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
