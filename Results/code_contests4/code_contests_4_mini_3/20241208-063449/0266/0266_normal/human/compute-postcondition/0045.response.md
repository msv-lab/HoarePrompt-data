Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 2, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - 97`, `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), and `j` is 1. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`.***
