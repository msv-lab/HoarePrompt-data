The value of `dyn[j][last]` is assigned the sum of `dyn[j][first]` and the length of the string `s`. The previous values of `first` and `last` have been calculated from the string `s`, where `first` is `ord(s[0]) - 97` and `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`. The length of the string `s` is also considered. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the calculation directly.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the impact of the current operations on the `dyn` array with respect to the values of `first`, `last`, and `len(s)`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 2, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - 97`, `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), dyn[j][last] is assigned dyn[j][first] + len(s)**
