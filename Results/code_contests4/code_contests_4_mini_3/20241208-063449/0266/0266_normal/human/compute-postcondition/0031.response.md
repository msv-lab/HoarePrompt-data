The code assigns a new value to `dyn[j][last]`, which is calculated as `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `first`, `last`, and `s`. 

- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, which is the zero-based index of the first character of the string `s`.
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, which is the zero-based index of the last character of the string `s`.
- `len(s)` gives the length of the string `s`.

Thus, `dyn[j][last]` is updated to the value of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `first` is ord(s[0]) - ord('a'), `last` is ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), `j` is 2; `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`**.
