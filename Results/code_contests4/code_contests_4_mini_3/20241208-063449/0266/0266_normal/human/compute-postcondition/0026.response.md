Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `first` is ord(s[0]) - ord('a'), `last` is ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), `dyn[first][last]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `s`. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`.***
