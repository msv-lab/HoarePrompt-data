According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 1.

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` has to be less than `n`). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `first` is ord(s[0]) - ord('a'), `last` is ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), and `dyn[first][last]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
