According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of 26, which represents the lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The variable `j` is the loop index and is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. The loop will execute again for the next value of `j` if it is less than 26.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, the loop can continue executing as long as `j` is less than 26.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `first` is ord(s[0]) - ord('a'), `last` is ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 1.**
