According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop will iterate for each value of `j` from 0 to 25, representing the letters of the alphabet. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. This means that the loop has executed for `j = 0` (the first iteration).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. After the first iteration, `j` will be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500000), `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `first` is ord(s[0]) - ord('a'), `last` is ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), dyn[first][last] is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 1.**
