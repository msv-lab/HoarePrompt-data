Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters but reads two time inputs in the format "hh:mm" from the standard input, representing the start and end times of a contest. It calculates the average time between these two time points in minutes, formats the result as "hh:mm", and ensures both hours and minutes are always displayed with two digits. However, the function does not directly return or print the formatted average time, and there is no handling for invalid input formats or cases where the contest duration is not even or less than two minutes, which are implied by the annotations but not enforced in the code. **
