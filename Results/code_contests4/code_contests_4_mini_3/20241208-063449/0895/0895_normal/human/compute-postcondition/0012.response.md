The function `func` accepts four parameters: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2`. All of these parameters are integers representing the start and end times of a contest in hours and minutes, respectively, with the constraints that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23 and 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59. The function also assumes that the contest lasts an even number of minutes and at least two minutes. Based on the input parameters, the function returns various outputs depending on the calculated duration of the contest. 

Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing the start and end times of a contest in hours and minutes, and it returns outputs based on the contest duration, ensuring the duration is an even number of minutes and at least two minutes.**
