The variable `c` is assigned the value of `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`, where `a` is a tuple that represents the hours and minutes parsed from the input. The specific values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are unknown but are integers representing the hour and minute, respectively. Therefore, `c` will hold the total number of minutes represented by the time in `a`.

The values of the other variables (`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2`) are not affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers; `c` is the total minutes calculated from `a`.**
