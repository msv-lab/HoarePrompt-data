Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is a Python 2 function. In a Python 3 environment, this would raise an error. The problem description does not specify the Python version, but typically Python 3 is the standard in competitive programming.

2. **Reading Input**: The program uses `map(int, raw_input().split(':'))` which would result in a `TypeError` because `map` returns a map object in Python 3, and you cannot directly index it like a list. The correct approach would be to convert it to a list first.

3. **Calculating Midpoint**: The midpoint calculation is incorrect because:
   - The program simply adds the two times in minutes and divides by 2, but it does not correctly account for the hours when converting back to the "hh:mm" format. The midpoint may not be calculated correctly if the total minutes exceed 60, leading to incorrect hour values.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program formats the hours and minutes but does not print them at the end. The problem description requires the output to be printed in the format "hh:mm".

5. **No Return or Print Statement**: The function does not have any return or print statement to output the final result, which is a critical part of fulfilling the problem's requirements.

In summary, the program does not correctly read inputs, calculate the midpoint of the contest, or format the output according to the problem description. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements and is incorrect.
