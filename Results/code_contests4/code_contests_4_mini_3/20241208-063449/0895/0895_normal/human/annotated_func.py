#State of the program right berfore the function call: h_1, m_1, h_2, and m_2 are integers representing the start and end times of the contest in hours and minutes, respectively, with 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23 and 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59. The contest lasts an even number of minutes and at least two minutes.
def func():
    a = map(int, raw_input().split(':'))
    c = a[0] * 60 + a[1]
    a = map(int, raw_input().split(':'))
    c += a[0] * 60 + a[1]
    c /= 2
    d = map(str, divmod(c, 60))
    if (len(d[0]) == 1) :
        d[0] = '0' + d[0]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers; `c` is updated to `c + a[0] * 60 + a[1]`; if the length of the first character of string `d` is 1, '0' is prepended to it.
    if (len(d[1]) == 1) :
        d[1] = '0' + d[1]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers; `c` is updated to `c + a[0] * 60 + a[1]`. If the length of the second character of string `d` is 1, '0' is prepended to `d[1]`, resulting in `d[1]` being '0' + `d[1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters but reads two time inputs in the format "hh:mm" from the standard input, representing the start and end times of a contest. It calculates the average time between these two time points in minutes, formats the result as "hh:mm", and ensures both hours and minutes are always displayed with two digits. However, the function does not directly return or print the formatted average time, and there is no handling for invalid input formats or cases where the contest duration is not even or less than two minutes, which are implied by the annotations but not enforced in the code.
