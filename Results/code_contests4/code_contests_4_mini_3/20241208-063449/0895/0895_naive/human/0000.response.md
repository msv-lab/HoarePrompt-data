To determine if the given program correctly computes the midpoint of a contest based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and identify any potential edge cases.

1. **Understanding the Program**: 
   - The program reads two times in the format hh:mm, calculates the total minutes from the start time and end time, sums them, divides by 2 to find the midpoint, and then converts it back into hh:mm format.
   - It uses `divmod` to convert the total minutes back into hours and minutes.

2. **Key Points from the Problem Description**:
   - The contest lasts an even number of minutes.
   - The contest time is within one day (24-hour format).
   - The output should be in the format hh:mm with leading zeros when necessary.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only handles the input correctly if the times are read as 24-hour formatted strings.
   - The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. If the code were to be run in Python 3, it would raise an error.
   - The program does not handle the case where the starting time and ending time are the same, which theoretically should not exist based on the problem description (since it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes), but does not explicitly handle it.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that the contest duration is at least two minutes and that the times will be valid, but an edge case would be the minimum valid duration:
     - Input: `00:00` and `00:02`. Expected Output: `00:01`.
     - The program would read `c = 0*60 + 0 + 2 = 2`, divides by 2 giving `1`, and outputs `00:01` correctly.

5. **Analyzing the Output**:
   - The program correctly adds and calculates the midpoints based on the provided examples in the problem description.
   - The leading zero logic is applied correctly using string manipulation.

6. **Conclusion**: 
   - Since the program handles the input, processes the time correctly, and outputs the expected format according to the problem description without missing any edge cases related to the constraints given, we conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
