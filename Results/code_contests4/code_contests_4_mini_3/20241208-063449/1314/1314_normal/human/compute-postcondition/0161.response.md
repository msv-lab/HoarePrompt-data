According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `ds[nxt]`. The loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in `ds[nxt]` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `nxt` is at least 3, and `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, with `el` being the second element in `ds[nxt]`. This means there is at least one more element to iterate over.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `el` now refers to the third element in `ds[nxt]`, and `i` will be incremented accordingly. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, with `arr[el]` being 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 3 elements, with `el` being the third element in `ds[nxt]`.**
