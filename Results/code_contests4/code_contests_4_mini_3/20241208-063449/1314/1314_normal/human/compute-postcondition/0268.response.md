According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `dmain[nxt]`. If `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including `el` if `el` was not in `vis`, `vis` now contains the value `1`, and `el` has been added if it was not in it. `res` now contains the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, and `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one element which has not been processed yet. In this case, `el` should be the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, and `nxt` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including `el` if `el` was not in `vis`, `vis` now contains the value `1`, and `el` has been added if it was not in it, `res` now contains the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop, `nxt` is still the last element from `sv`, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`.**
