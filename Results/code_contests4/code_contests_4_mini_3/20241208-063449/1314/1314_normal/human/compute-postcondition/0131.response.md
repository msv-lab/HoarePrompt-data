`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 2. Since the element at index `el` of `arr` was previously 0, it is updated to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2 (now including index `el`), `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` has at least one element, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, and `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
