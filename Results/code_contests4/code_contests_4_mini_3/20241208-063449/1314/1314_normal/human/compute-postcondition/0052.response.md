The code assigns the value of `cur` to the element at index `el` in the array `arr`. The variable `cur` has a value of 1. Since `el` is used as an index in `arr`, and there are no restrictions mentioned regarding the value of `el` or the state of `arr`, we assume that the assignment is valid. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `nxt`, and `ds[2]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is 2, `ds[2]` contains at least 1 element remaining; `arr[el]` is assigned the value 1.**
