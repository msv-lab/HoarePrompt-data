According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `ds[nxt]`. The variable `i` is currently 2, which indicates it has executed twice already, and `cur` is also 2. The loop is dependent on the number of elements within `ds[nxt]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 2, meaning `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time. Since `i` is 2, the next value of `i` will be 3 after the loop executes again. 

Assuming `el` refers to the current element being processed in the loop, we need to ensure that the loop can process the next element in `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute a third time, it needs to access the third element in `ds[nxt]`, and `el` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `ds[nxt]` must have at least 3 elements.**
