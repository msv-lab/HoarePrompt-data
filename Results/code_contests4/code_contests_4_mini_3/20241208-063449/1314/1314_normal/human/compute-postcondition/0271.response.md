The line of code `res.append(str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el))` appends a new string to the list `res`. This string is formed by concatenating the string representation of `nxt` and `el` with a space in between. The previous values of `nxt` and `el` are used for this concatenation. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, if `nxt` is the last element from `sv` and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, the output state reflects the updated `res` list, which now includes the new string.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` now contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including the added `el`, `vis` now contains the value `1` and the added element `el`, `res` contains the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop, `nxt` is still the last element from `sv`, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`; new entry added to `res` is '<nxt> <el>'.**
