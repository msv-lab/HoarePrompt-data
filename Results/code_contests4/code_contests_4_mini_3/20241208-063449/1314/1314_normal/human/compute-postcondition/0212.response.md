The operation `dmain[el].remove(1)` will attempt to remove the value `1` from the list or set associated with the key `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. This action modifies the contents of `dmain[el]`. Since `el` is the first element in `ite` and `arr[el]` is confirmed to be in `sviaz`, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The previous values of `cur`, `arr`, `sviaz`, `ite`, and `i` are not affected by this operation directly. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` is an empty set, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]` and contains at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `ite`, and `arr[el]` is in `sviaz`; `1` has been removed from `dmain[el]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` is an empty set, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]` and contains at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `ite`, and `arr[el]` is in `sviaz`; `1` has been removed from `dmain[el]`.**
