The variable `i` is assigned the value `2`. The values of the other variables (`n` and `arr`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer; `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros; `i` is 2**
