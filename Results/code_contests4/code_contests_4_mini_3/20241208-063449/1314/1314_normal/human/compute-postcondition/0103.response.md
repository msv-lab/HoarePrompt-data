The value of `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 2. The initial state indicates that `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, except for `arr[2]`, which is already 2. The variable `cur` is also 2. Therefore, after the execution of the statement, `arr[el]` will be set to 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array with `arr[2]` as 2 and `arr[el]` set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` includes `el`, and `ds[nxt]` must have at least `k + 1` elements.**
