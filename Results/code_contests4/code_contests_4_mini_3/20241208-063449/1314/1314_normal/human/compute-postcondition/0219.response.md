Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, and `arr` has been updated. If `arr[el]` was not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` is updated to include `arr[el]`. Otherwise, `sviaz` remains unchanged. Additionally, `ite` has at least 2 elements and `el` is the second element in `ite`. If `arr[el]` was already in `sviaz`, then `dmain[el]` has 1 removed from it.***
