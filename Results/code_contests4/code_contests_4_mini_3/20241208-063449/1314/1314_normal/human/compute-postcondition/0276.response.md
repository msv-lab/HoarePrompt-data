The value of `nxt` is assigned the value popped from `sv`, which means that one element is removed from `sv`. The previous state of `sv` is unknown, but it is guaranteed to have at least one element for the loop to execute again. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` had elements before popping and now has one less element after the operation, and `nxt` is assigned the value of the popped element from `sv`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` had elements before popping and now has one less element, and `nxt` is the popped element from `sv`.**
