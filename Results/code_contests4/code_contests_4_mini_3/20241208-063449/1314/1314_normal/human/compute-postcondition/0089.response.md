Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, and `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[i]` was 0, then `cur` is set to 1, `tov` is empty, and all elements in `arr` that were initially 0 have been updated to 1 for all indices reachable from index 2 through the adjacency list `ds`.***
