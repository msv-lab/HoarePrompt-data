Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el + 1` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` was initially 0, `el` has been added to `tov`.***
