The `res` list is updated to include a new string formed by concatenating the string representations of `nxt` and `el`, separated by a space. The previous state of `res` is not provided, but it already contains the strings 'YES' and '<nxt> <next_el>'. The addition of the new string does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated contents of `res`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` now includes the element `el`, `vis` includes the next element in `dmain[nxt]` and has the value `1`, `res` now includes the strings 'YES', '<nxt> <next_el>', and the new string 'nxt el', `dmain[next_el]` no longer contains `nxt`, and `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element beyond the current `el` for the loop to execute a second time; `vis` now includes `el`.**
