`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 3. Since it is stated that `arr[el]` was previously 0 and has been set to 3, this assignment will overwrite that value. The values of the other variables `n`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, and `nxt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` with `arr[el]` now being 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, and `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 2 elements, with `el` being the second element in `ds[nxt]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` with `arr[el]` now being 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, and `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 2 elements, with `el` being the second element in `ds[nxt]`.**
