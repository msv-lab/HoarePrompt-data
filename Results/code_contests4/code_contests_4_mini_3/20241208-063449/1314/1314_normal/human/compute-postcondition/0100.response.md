The code snippet `tov.add(el)` adds the variable `el` to the set `tov`. The previous state indicates that `tov` has one less element, implying it is not empty, and `el` is a valid element to be added. Since the other variables (`n`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `nxt`) are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `arr[2]` which is now 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` now includes `el`, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds` pointing to a non-empty iterable, and `arr[el]` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `arr[2]` which is now 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` now includes `el`, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds` pointing to a non-empty iterable, `arr[el]` is now 2.**
