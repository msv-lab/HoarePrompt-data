According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains at least one element from `ds[nxt]` that was initially 0, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, and `ds[nxt]` is not empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element than it did at the end of the last iteration. Since `el` has already been added to `tov`, for the next iteration, `el` should be incremented to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `el` has moved to the next index in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element available.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el + 1` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains at least two elements from `ds[nxt]` that were initially 0, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty and has at least one more element, and `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.**
