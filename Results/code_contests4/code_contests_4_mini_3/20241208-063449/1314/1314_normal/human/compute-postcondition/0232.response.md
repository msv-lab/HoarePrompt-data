`nxt` is assigned the value of `sv.pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of the list `sv`. The previous value of `sv` was `1`, so after executing this line, `sv` will be empty. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` is now empty, `vis` now contains the value `1`, and `res` is a list containing the string 'YES'.
