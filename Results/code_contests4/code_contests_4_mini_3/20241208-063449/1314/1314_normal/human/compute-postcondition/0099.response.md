The value of `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 2. Since `arr[el]` was previously 0, it is now updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `arr[2]` which is now 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` has one less element, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds` pointing to a non-empty iterable, and `arr[el]` is now 2.
