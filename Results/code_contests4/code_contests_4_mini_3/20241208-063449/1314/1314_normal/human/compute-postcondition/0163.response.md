The variable `tov` is a set (or similar collection) and the operation `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to `tov`. The previous state indicates that `el` is a valid element in the context provided. There are no other variables affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, with `arr[el]` being 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 3 elements, with `el` being the third element in `ds[nxt]`; `tov` now contains `el` added to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, with `arr[el]` being 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 3 elements, with `el` being the third element in `ds[nxt]`; `tov` now contains `el` added to it.**
