The operation `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. The previous state of `tov` is not explicitly given, but it already contains `el` as stated. Therefore, executing `tov.add(el)` will not change the content of `tov` since sets do not allow duplicate entries. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` with `arr[el]` now being 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, and `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 2 elements, with `el` being the second element in `ds[nxt]`, and `tov` remains unchanged after attempting to add `el`.**
