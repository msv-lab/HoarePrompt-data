Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, if `arr[el]` was not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` has an element added from `arr[el]`. If `arr[el]` was already in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` remains unchanged and `el` has been removed from `dmain[1]`. Additionally, `ite` has at least 3 elements and `el` is the third element in `ite`.***
