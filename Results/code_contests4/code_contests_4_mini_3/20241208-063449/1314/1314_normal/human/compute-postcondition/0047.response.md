According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ds[nxt]` list. If `ds[nxt]` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is 2, and `ds[2]` contains at least one element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `nxt` needs to remain the same (as it is still 2), and the next element `el` will be the next element in `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, the loop will iterate again for the second element in that list. Therefore, `el` will take the value of this next element in `ds[2]`, and `cur` and `tov` may change according to the loop's body.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` is 2, and `ds[2]` contains at least 2 elements.**
