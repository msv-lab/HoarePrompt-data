The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, and since `cur` was previously set to 2, it will now become 3. Other variables are not affected. The condition for the loop to execute again is still satisfied as `n` is greater than 3. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, and `tov` is empty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` is empty**
