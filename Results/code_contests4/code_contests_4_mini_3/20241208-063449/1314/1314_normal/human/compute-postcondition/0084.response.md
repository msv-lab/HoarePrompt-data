The value of `arr[el]` is set to `cur`, and since `cur` is 1, `arr[el]` becomes 1. The initial conditions indicate that the loop will execute again, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the next element `el`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element remaining, and `arr[el]` is now set to 1.
