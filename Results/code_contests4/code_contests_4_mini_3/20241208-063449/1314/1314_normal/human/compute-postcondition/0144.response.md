Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, and `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`. If `arr[i]` is 0, then `arr` is updated such that all reachable indices from the starting point (2) are set to 2, `i` is at least 2, `cur` is set to 2, and `tov` is empty, indicating that all elements have been processed and there are no more to explore.***
