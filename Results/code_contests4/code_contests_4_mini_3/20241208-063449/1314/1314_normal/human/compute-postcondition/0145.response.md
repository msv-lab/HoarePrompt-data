The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is at least 2 (as stated in the initial conditions). Therefore, after execution, `i` will be at least 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `arr`, `cur`, and `tov`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is set to 2, and `tov` is empty.**
