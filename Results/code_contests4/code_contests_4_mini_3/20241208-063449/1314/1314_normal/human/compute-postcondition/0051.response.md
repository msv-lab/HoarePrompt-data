According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. In the previous iteration, `nxt` is 2, which means the loop is iterating over `ds[2]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, and `tov` contains `el`. The loop will execute again if `ds[2]` has at least one more element to iterate over. 

Since `ds[2]` contains at least 2 elements, and one element has already been processed, there is still at least 1 element left. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration of the loop, so it will become 3. The loop will continue to iterate over the elements in `ds[2]`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the relevant states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 3, and the loop will continue with the next element from `ds[2]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is 2, and `ds[2]` contains at least 1 element remaining.**
