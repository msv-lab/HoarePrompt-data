According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ite`. If `ite` contains more than 1 element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, and `el` is the first element in `ite`. Since `el` has been removed from `dmain[1]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ite` must have at least 2 elements remaining. 

As `el` was the first element in `ite`, the next `el` will be the second element in `ite` after the first iteration. 

State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains `arr[el]` if it was not in `sviaz`, otherwise remains an empty set, `ite` has at least 2 elements, and `el` is the second element in `ite`.**
