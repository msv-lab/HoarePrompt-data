The value of `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is currently 2. Since `el` is not specified, we only know that `cur` is being assigned to the position `arr[el]`. The affected variable is `arr`, and since `arr[el]` is being updated to 2, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `arr[el]` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index `el` set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` includes 2**
