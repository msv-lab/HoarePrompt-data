The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Since `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]` and `tov` already contains at least two elements from `ds[nxt]` that were initially 0, the addition of `el` will not affect the existing elements in `tov` but will include the new value of `el`. The other variables remain unchanged in their respective states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el + 1` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty and has at least one more element, and `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now 3.**
