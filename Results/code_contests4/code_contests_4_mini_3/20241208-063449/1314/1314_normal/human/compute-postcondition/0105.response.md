Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `arr[2]` which is 2. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is set to 2, `i` remains 2, `cur` remains 2, and `tov` now includes 2. Additionally, `ds[nxt]` must have at least `k + 1` elements.***
