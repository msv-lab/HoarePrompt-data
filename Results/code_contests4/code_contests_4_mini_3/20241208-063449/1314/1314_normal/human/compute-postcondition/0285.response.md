The `sv` set adds the element `el` to it. The previous state of `sv` is that it has one less element, but now it will contain one additional element after adding `el`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `cur`, `arr`, `sviaz`, `ite`, `dmain`, `nxt`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `sv`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains reachable values, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated, `sv` has one more element after adding `el`, for the loop to execute one more time `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`.**
