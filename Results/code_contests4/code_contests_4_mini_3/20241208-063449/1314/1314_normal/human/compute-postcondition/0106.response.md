According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has a length of `n + 1` filled with zeros except `arr[2]` which is 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` includes 2, and `ds[nxt]` must have at least `k + 1` elements. 

Since `el` is iterating through `ds[nxt]`, and we want to execute the loop one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element than it did in the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to increment `el` to represent the next element in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `arr[2]` which is 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` includes 2, for the loop to execute a second time `ds[nxt]` must have at least `k + 2` elements.**
