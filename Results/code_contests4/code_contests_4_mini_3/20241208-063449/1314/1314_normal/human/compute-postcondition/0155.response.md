The variable `tov` is updated by adding the value of `el` to it. The value of `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and since `tov` is initially empty, it will now contain the element `el`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now 3.**
