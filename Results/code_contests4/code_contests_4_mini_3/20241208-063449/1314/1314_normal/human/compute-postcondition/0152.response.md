According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the structure of `ds` and the value of `nxt`. The loop will execute if `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least one element. Given that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is at least 3, `nxt` is set to the value of `i`, which means `nxt` is at least 3. For the loop to execute the first time, `ds` must have a valid entry for the index `nxt` (which is at least 3), and that entry must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `ds[nxt]` must be iterable and contain at least one element.
- `nxt` is 3 (or greater if `i` is greater than 3).
- `el` will be the first element from `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` is empty after popping, `nxt` is at least 3, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 1 element, and `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`.**
