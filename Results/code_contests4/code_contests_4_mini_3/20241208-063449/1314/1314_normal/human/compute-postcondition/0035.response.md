According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2 to ensure that the condition `i < n` holds true.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0**
