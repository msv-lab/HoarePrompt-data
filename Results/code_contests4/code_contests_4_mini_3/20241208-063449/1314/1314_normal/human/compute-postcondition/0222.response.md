The code `dmain[el].remove(1)` attempts to remove the value `1` from the list or collection associated with the key `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. The execution of this line impacts the state of the variable `dmain`, specifically the entry corresponding to `el`.

Since the previous values of `i`, `cur`, `arr`, and `sviaz` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged. The variable `ite` still has at least 3 elements, and `el` is confirmed to be the third element.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` is unchanged, `ite` has at least 3 elements, `el` is the third element in `ite`, and the value `1` has been removed from `dmain[el]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` is unchanged, `ite` has at least 3 elements, `el` is the third element in `ite`, and the value `1` has been removed from `dmain[el]**.
