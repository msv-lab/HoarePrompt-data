The code snippet `dmain[1].remove(el)` attempts to remove the element `el` from the list associated with the key `1` in the dictionary `dmain`. The initial state specifies that `el` is the third element in `ite`. Since no other variables are affected by this operation, we focus on the change to `dmain`.

The previous value of `dmain[1]` is not provided, but it is implied that `el` exists in `dmain[1]` since it is being removed. After this operation, the list associated with the key `1` in `dmain` will no longer include `el`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `el` has been removed from `dmain[1]`, while the values of `i`, `cur`, `arr`, `sviaz`, and `ite` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` is unchanged, `ite` has at least 3 elements, `el` is the third element in `ite`, and `el` has been removed from `dmain[1]**.
