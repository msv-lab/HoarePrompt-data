The value at `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, which is 3. Since `el` is 4, the previous value of `arr[4]` was 0, and now it is assigned the value of `cur`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `ds[nxt]` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the `arr` array.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index 4 to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `el` is 4, and `arr[4]` is now 3.**
