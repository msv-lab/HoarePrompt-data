The value at index `el` of the array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 3. Since it is given that the element at index `el` of `arr` is initially 0, after the assignment, `arr[el]` will now be 3. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `tov`, `nxt`, and `ds`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` is a list with at least one element, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds` where `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element.**
