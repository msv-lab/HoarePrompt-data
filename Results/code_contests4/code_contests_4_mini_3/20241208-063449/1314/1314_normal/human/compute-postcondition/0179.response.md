The `tov` variable is a collection that has the method `add(el)`, which adds the value of `el` to `tov`. Since `el` is pointing to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and the previous state indicates that `tov` can accept that value, this operation will successfully add `el` to `tov`. The values of other variables remain unchanged, and we do not have any return statement in this context.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el + 1` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now 3; `el` has been added to `tov`.**
