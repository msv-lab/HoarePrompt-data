`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 2. Since `el` is guaranteed to be a valid index (as `arr` has at least one index set to 2, and we assume `el` is that index), this assignment will change the value at `arr[el]` to 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `ds[nxt]`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2 (now modified to set `arr[el]` to 2 if it wasn't already), `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, and `tov` now contains `el`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2 (now modified), `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` now contains `el`.**
