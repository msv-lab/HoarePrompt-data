The `tov.add(el)` statement adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Given that `tov` contains at least one element from `ds[nxt]` that was initially 0, we know that `tov` is a set and can contain unique elements. The value of `el` is being added to `tov` without affecting the other variables. Since `arr` has been updated, and `cur`, `i`, `n`, and `ds[nxt]` are in their respective states, the specific previous value of `el` is not stated, but it can be inferred that it is a valid index or element.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains at least one element from `ds[nxt]` that was initially 0, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty for the loop to execute, and `el` has been added to `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains at least one element from `ds[nxt]` that was initially 0, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty for the loop to execute, and `el` has been added to `tov`.**
