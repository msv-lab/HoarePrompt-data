The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the `tov` set. Since `el` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only assume that `el` is the index of `arr` that is set to 2. As a result, `tov` will now include this index. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `arr[el]` is now 2, and `el` has been added to `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `arr[el]` is now 2, and `el` has been added to `tov`.**
