Given the provided information and the loop code, here's the analysis of the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing:

- The variable `n` remains greater than 2.
- The variable `i` starts at 2, but it's not modified in the loop, so it will retain its initial value of 2.
- The variable `cur` retains its value of 1 throughout the loop since it is not modified.
- The set `tov` will contain all elements `el` from `ds[nxt]` that correspond to indices in `arr` where `arr[el]` was initially 0, as each such `el` would have been added to `tov`.
- The variable `nxt` remains 2, as it is not modified in the loop.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have completed, the output state will reflect that `arr` is updated at all indices that were 0 and correspond to the elements in `ds[2]`. Also, `tov` will contain all such indices.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains all elements `el` from `ds[2]` for which `arr[el]` was initially 0, `nxt` is 2, and `arr` has been updated at indices in `tov` to 1.**
