The statement `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set or collection `tov`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `tov` has at least one element before popping, and `arr[el]` is now 1. The value of `el` is not specified, but since `arr[el]` is 1, it implies that `el` is a valid index in `arr`. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `el` to `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` now has the element `el` added, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in `tov` before popping, and `arr[el]` is now 1.**
