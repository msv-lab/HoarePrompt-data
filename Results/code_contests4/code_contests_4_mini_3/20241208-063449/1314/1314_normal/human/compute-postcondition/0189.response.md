According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has more elements remaining, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3, and `n` is an integer greater than 2, which means `nxt` should also be set such that it points to a valid index in `ds`. 

The loop will iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, so for it to execute one more time, `el` must point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. Since `i` is at least 3, and `el` iterates through the elements of `ds[nxt]`, `el` will need to be incremented by 1 to refer to the next element. 

If `ds[nxt]` has at least 4 elements, for the loop to execute a second time, `el` must be at least 4 (the next index). Additionally, we need to ensure that the state of `arr`, `cur`, and `tov` is considered based on the condition provided.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `ds[nxt]` must have at least 4 elements, and `el` must be 4. If `arr[el]` is initially 0, `tov` will include `el`.**
