The operation `dmain[el].remove(nxt)` removes the element `nxt` from the list associated with the key `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. The previous state indicates that `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one element and `el` is the first element in `dmain[nxt]` that was not in `vis` before the operation. Removing `nxt` will affect the list in `dmain[el]`, but no other variables are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` contains the value `1` and now includes `el`, `res` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and '<nxt> <el>', `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt`.**
