According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. Since `ds[nxt]` contains at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `cur` is 1. The loop variable `el` is currently the third element in `ds[nxt]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `el` will need to be the fourth element in `ds[nxt]`, and `i` will be increased by 1. The value of `cur` does not change and continues to represent the current state. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a fourth time, `el` should be the fourth element in `ds[nxt]`, and the index `i` will be 4. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 4, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the element `el`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 4 elements, and `el` is the fourth element in `ds[nxt]`.**
