According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, and `tov` contains at least one element, we need to ensure that the assignment to `nxt` points to a valid index in `ds` where `ds[nxt]` is non-empty.

Since `nxt` has been assigned a value from `tov` and an element has been removed from `tov`, we can conclude that `tov` had at least one element before the assignment, which aligns with the requirement for `nxt` to point to a valid index in `ds`. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `ds[nxt]` is non-empty. Therefore, the relevant states can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated for all indices in `ds[nxt]` that were initially 0 to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` is a list with at least one element, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds` where `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element**
