According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, and `tov` has the element `el` added. The variable `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in `tov` before popping, and if `arr[el]` was 0, it is now set to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element remaining. Since `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `i` will be incremented for the next iteration. After one iteration of the loop, `el` will take on the next element from `ds[nxt]`, so we need to account for that as well.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to reflect that a new element will be accessed in the next iteration of the loop, and `nxt` must be assigned the last element from `tov` again, which will still reflect the current state of `tov`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` has the element `el` added, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element remaining, `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in `tov` before popping, and `arr[el]` is set to 1.**
