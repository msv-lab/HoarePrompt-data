Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated for all indices in `ds` that were initially 0 to 3. If `arr[i]` equals 0, then `i` is at least 3, `cur` is updated to 3, `tov` remains empty, indicating that all reachable elements have been processed, and `nxt` is no longer defined as `tov` is empty.***
