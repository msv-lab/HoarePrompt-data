`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1. Since `cur` is 1 and `arr[el]` was previously 0, after execution, `arr[el]` will now be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` has at least one element before popping, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in `tov` before popping, and `arr[el]` is now 1.
