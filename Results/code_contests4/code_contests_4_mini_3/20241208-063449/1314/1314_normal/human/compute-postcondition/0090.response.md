The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, but since that value is not specified, we can only state that `i` is increased by 1. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is increased by 1, `cur` is set to 1, `tov` is empty, and all elements in `arr` that were initially 0 have been updated to 1 for all indices reachable from index 2 through the adjacency list `ds`.
