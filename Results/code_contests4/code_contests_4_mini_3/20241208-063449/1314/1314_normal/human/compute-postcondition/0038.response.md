The code creates a set `tov` that contains the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, the set `tov` will contain the single element `{2}`. The other variables remain unchanged, as this operation only affects the new variable `tov`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, the element at index `i` of `arr` is 0, and `tov` is {2}.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, the element at index `i` of `arr` is 0, and `tov` is {2}.**
