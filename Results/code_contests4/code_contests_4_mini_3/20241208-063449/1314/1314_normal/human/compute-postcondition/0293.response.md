In this case, `res` is a list to which a new string is appended. The string consists of the values of `nxt` and `el`, both of which are converted to strings. The previous values of `nxt` and `el` are not stated, but they are both assumed to have valid values. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains reachable values, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated, `sv` has one more element after adding `el`, `vis` now contains the element `el`, `el` has been added to `sv`, and `res` now contains the string representation of `nxt` and `el`.**
