According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nxt` and the structure `ds`. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2, the loop can execute again based on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, and `cur` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `nxt` must point to an element in `ds` that contains at least one more element for `el` to iterate through. 

Therefore, if `ds[nxt]` contains at least 3 elements, `el` will be the next element in that list. So, after adjusting for the next iteration, `el` should be incremented to the next index, and `nxt` will remain the same, assuming it still points to a valid list of elements.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `ds[nxt]` must have at least 3 elements, and `el` is the next element in the list.**
