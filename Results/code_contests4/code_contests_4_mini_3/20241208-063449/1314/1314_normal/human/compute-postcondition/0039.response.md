`arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, where `cur` is 1 and `i` is 2. This means that the element at index 2 of `arr`, which was previously 0, is now updated to 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` with the element at index 2 updated to 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, and `tov` is {2}.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` with the element at index 2 updated to 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, and `tov` is {2}**
