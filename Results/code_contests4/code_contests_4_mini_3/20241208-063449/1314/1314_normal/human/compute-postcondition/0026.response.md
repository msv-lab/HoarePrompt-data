The code `dmain[f].add(s)` adds the value `s` to the set or collection `dmain[f]`. The initial state indicates that `dmain[s]` already includes `f`, but there are no changes to the values of `n`, `m`, or `D`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dmain[s]` now includes `f`, and `s` is added to `dmain[f]`.

Output State: **`dmain[s]` now includes `f`, and `s` is added to `dmain[f]`**.
