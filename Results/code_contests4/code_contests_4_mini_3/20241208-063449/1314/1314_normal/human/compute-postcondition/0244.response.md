Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` includes `el`, `vis` includes `el` and has the value `1`, `res` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and '<nxt> <next_el>', `dmain[next_el]` no longer contains `nxt`, and `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element beyond the current `el` for the loop to execute a second time, if `el` was not already in `vis`.***
