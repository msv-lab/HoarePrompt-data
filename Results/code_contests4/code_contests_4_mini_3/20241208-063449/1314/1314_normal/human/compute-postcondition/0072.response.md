According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `tov` is non-empty (i.e., its length is greater than 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `len(tov)` is greater than 0, meaning that the loop can proceed again without any adjustments needed.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains all elements added during the loop's execution, `ds[nxt]` may contain elements such that all corresponding indices in `arr` that were 0 are now updated to 1**
