The value of `sv` is updated by adding the integer `1` to it. Since `sv` is initially an empty set, after this operation, `sv` will contain the value `1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, and `sv` now contains the value `1`.
