Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `m` is an integer representing the number of edges (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(200,000, (n(n-1))/2)), `D` is an integer representing the required degree of the first vertex (1 ≤ D < n), and `input` is redefined as a lambda function to read from the standard input stream.**
