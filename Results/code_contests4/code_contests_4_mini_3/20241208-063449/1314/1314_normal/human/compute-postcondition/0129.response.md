According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `nxt` and the structure of `ds`. Specifically, for the loop to execute, `ds[nxt]` must be iterable and contain at least one element. 

Given that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is at least 2, this indicates that `nxt` must be a valid index within `ds`, and `ds` must be appropriately populated. The state of `nxt` being an element popped from `tov` implies that `tov` must have had elements prior to this operation, which is already stated.

Since `arr` has at least one index set to 2, and `cur` is 2, these values do not directly affect the execution of the loop but may be relevant in the context of the program logic. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `nxt` corresponds to a valid key/index in `ds`, and that `ds[nxt]` is non-empty.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` has at least one element, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.**
