The code `sv.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set `sv`. Since `el` has been added if it was not already in `vis`, and we know that `vis` now contains the value `1`, the addition will occur provided `el` is not in `vis`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` now contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including `el` which is now added to `sv`, `vis` still contains the value `1`, `res` contains the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop, `nxt` is still the last element from `sv`, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`.
