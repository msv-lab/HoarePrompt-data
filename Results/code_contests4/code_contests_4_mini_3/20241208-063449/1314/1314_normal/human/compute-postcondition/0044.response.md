The statement `arr[el] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the element at index `el` in the array `arr`. Given the initial state, `cur` is 1, and the element at index `el` in `arr` is currently 0. Therefore, after executing this line, the value at `arr[el]` changes from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` is an empty set, `nxt` is 2, `ds[2]` contains at least one element, the element at index `el` in `arr` is now 1.**
