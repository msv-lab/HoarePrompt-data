The variable `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1. Therefore, after execution, `arr[el]` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` has the element `el` added, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element remaining, `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in `tov` before popping, and `arr[el]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` has the element `el` added, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element remaining, `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in `tov` before popping, `arr[el]` is 1.**
