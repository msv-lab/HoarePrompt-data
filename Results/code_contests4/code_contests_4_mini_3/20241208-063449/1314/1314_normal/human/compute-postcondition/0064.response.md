The statement `arr[el] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` in the array `arr`. Given the initial state, `cur` is 1, and `el` is specified as the third element in `ds[nxt]`. The operation updates the element at index `el` of `arr` to 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ds[nxt]`) remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the change made to `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the element `el`, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 3 elements, `el` is the third element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is updated to 1.**
