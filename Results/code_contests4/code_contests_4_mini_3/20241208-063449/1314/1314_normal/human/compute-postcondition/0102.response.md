According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the `ds` array and the value of `nxt`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, and `arr[el]` has been set to 2. The variable `el` is the current element being processed in `ds[nxt]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain more elements to iterate over. Hence, we need to determine the next value of `el` for the next iteration. Assuming `el` was pointing to the last element in `ds[nxt]` during the last iteration, we need to check how many elements `ds[nxt]` has.

If `ds[nxt]` had `m` elements and `el` was pointing to the `k-th` element, then to loop again `el` must be incremented to `k + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `el` must be the next element in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `arr[2]` which is now 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` includes `el`, for the loop to execute a second time `ds[nxt]` must have at least `k + 1` elements, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]` after the last one processed.**
