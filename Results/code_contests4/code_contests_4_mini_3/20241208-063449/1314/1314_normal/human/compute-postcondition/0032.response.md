The code initializes an array `arr` with a size of `n + 1`, filled with zeros. The value of `n` is an integer, but its specific value is not known. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of the array with its length dependent on the value of `n`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros**
