According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `dmain[nxt]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one element. Given the current state, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` is now empty, `vis` contains the value `1`, and `res` is a list containing the string 'YES'.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time:
1. `dmain[nxt]` must have at least one element.
2. `el` will represent the first element in `dmain[nxt]`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` is now empty, `vis` contains the value `1`, `res` is a list containing the string 'YES', for the loop to execute the first time `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `dmain[nxt]`**.
