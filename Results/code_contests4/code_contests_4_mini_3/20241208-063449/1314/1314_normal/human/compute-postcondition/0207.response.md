Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated such that each index reachable from the starting index 2 through the adjacency list `ds` has the same value as `cur`, and all other indices remain 0 if they were never reached; `sviaz` is an empty set; `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`.**
