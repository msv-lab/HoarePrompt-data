The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set or collection `tov`. The state of `tov` will change to include the new element `el`, while the other variables remain unaffected. Given that `el` is not specified but is referenced in the context, we can conclude that `tov` will now have `el` included in its values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` now includes `el`, `nxt` is assigned the value of the removed element, `arr[el]` is updated to 2**.
