The code appends a string formed by concatenating the string representations of `nxt` and `el`, separated by a space, to the list `res`. The previous state indicates that `nxt` has been assigned the last element from `sv`, and `el` has been added to `vis`. Therefore, the list `res` will now include the new entry created from `nxt` and `el`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` now contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including `el`, `vis` now contains the value `1` and `el`, `res` now contains the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop, `nxt` has been assigned the last element from `sv`, `dmain[nxt]` is non-empty, `el` is not in `vis`, `el` has been added to `vis`, and the new entry `<nxt> <el>` has been appended to `res`.**
