The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Since `el` is set to 2, the value 2 will be added to the `tov` set. However, since `tov` already includes 2, adding it again will not change the set. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index `el` set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` still includes 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index `el` set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` still includes 2**
