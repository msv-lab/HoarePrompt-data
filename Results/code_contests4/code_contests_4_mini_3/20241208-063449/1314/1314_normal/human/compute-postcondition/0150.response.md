To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one time, we need to consider the condition `len(tov)` in the `while` statement. The loop will execute as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop:
- `n` is an integer greater than 2,
- `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`,
- `i` is at least 3,
- `cur` is 3,
- `tov` is initialized with the value `{i}`.

Since `i` is at least 3, `tov` will contain at least one element (the value of `i`), and thus `len(tov)` will be at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute.

No adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time since `len(tov)` is already greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` is {i}**
