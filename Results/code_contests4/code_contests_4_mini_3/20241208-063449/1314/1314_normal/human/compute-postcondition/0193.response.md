According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nxt` and the data structure `ds`. The loop iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3, meaning it has already gone through some iterations. The current element `el` is 4, but we need to check the size of `ds[nxt]`.

Since `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute provided that `ds[nxt]` has more elements than have already been accessed. If `i` is at least 3, this indicates that the loop has executed at least three times. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, and `el` should represent the next element in `ds[nxt]`.

If `ds[nxt]` has at least 4 elements, then after this iteration, `i` will become 4, and `el` will be the next element from `ds[nxt]`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index 4 to 3, `i` is 4, `cur` is 3, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` must have at least 5 elements.**
