`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 3. Since `arr[el]` was initially updated to 3, it remains 3 after this operation. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `tov`, `nxt`, `ds[nxt]`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el + 1` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el + 1` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now 3.**
