According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `tov` includes all unique elements that were processed from `ds[nxt]`. As long as `tov` contains elements, the loop can execute again.

Since the current state indicates that `len(tov)` is non-zero, the loop can indeed execute one more time without needing to adjust any states. Thus, no changes are required.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, and `tov` includes all unique elements that were processed from `ds[nxt]`.**
