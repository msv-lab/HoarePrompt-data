`cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is 0.**
