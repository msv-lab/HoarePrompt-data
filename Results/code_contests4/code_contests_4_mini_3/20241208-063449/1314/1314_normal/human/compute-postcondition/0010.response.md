Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `D` is an integer, `ds` is updated with `f` added to the set for key `s`, and `s` is added to the set for key `f` in `ds` if `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1. If either `s` or `f` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `ds` and `dmain`.***
