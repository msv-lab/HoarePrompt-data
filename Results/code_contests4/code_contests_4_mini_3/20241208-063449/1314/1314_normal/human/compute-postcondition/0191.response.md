The `tov.add(el)` line adds the value of `el` (which is 4) to the `tov` set or collection. Other variables (`n`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, and `el`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that the value `el` has been added to `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index 4 to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `el` is 4, `arr[4]` is now 3, and 4 has been added to `tov`.**
