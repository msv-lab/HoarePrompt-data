According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ds` and the value of `nxt`. The loop will iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `ds[nxt]` must be a valid iterable and must contain at least one element.

Given that `n` is greater than 2, `nxt` must be a valid index in `ds`, and `ds[nxt]` should not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nxt` is set to a valid index that points to a non-empty list or array within `ds`.

Currently, `i` is set to 2, and `cur` is also 2, which may or may not affect the value of `nxt`. However, since we are not provided with any specific information about `nxt`, we will assume it must be adjusted to ensure it points to a valid non-empty iterable.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` has one less element, `arr[2]` is now 2, for the loop to execute `nxt` must be a valid index in `ds` pointing to a non-empty iterable**.
