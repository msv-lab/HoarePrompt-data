The code assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` of the `arr` array. Given that `cur` is 3, the value at `arr[el]` will be updated to 3. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el + 1` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains at least two elements from `ds[nxt]` that were initially 0, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty and has at least one more element, and `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el + 1` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains at least two elements from `ds[nxt]` that were initially 0, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty and has at least one more element, and `el` is updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now 3.**
