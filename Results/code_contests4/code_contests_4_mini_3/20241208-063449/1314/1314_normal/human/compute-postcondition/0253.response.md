According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sv`. If `sv` has a length greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(sv)` is currently greater than 0, since the loop is designed to continue while there are still elements in `sv`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states for the loop to be able to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations, `vis` contains the value `1` and all elements that were added during the loop iterations, `res` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, and `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop.**
