`cur` is incremented by 1. Since `cur` was initially set to 1, after execution, `cur` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `arr`, `i`, and `tov`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is increased by 1, `cur` is 2, `tov` is empty, and the loop continues since `n` is still greater than `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is increased by 1, `cur` is 2, `tov` is empty, and the loop continues since `n` is greater than `i`.**
