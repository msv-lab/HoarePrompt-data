According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element after the last iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` now contains `el`, and `nxt` is a valid index in `ds` with at least one element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element, and `el` will be the next element in the sequence. Therefore, if `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, `el` will be the next element in `ds[nxt]` after the last one processed, and `i` may be adjusted based on the loop body.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` now contains `el`, for the loop to execute again `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element, and `el` will be the next element in `ds[nxt]`.**
