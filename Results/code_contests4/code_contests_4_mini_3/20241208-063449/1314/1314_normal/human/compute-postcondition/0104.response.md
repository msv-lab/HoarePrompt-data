The variable `tov` is assigned the value `tov.add(el)`, which adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. The previous state of `tov` is unchanged other than the addition of `el`. Since `el` is defined in the initial state as part of the array `arr`, it is assumed to be 2 based on the provided context. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr[2]` is 2, `arr[el]` is set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` now includes 2, and `ds[nxt]` must have at least `k + 1` elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr[2]` is 2, `arr[el]` is set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` now includes 2, `ds[nxt]` must have at least `k + 1` elements.**
