According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nxt` and the iterable `ds[nxt]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ds[nxt]` contains more elements to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, and `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 1 element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element beyond what has already been iterated. Since `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, after the first iteration, `el` will need to change to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` must still be iterable.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements. After the current iteration, `el` would be updated to the second element in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 2 elements, `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` was 0, then `arr[el]` is now 3.**
