According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `dmain[nxt]`. If `dmain[nxt]` is non-empty, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, and `nxt` has been assigned the last element from `sv`, ensuring that `dmain[nxt]` is non-empty. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `el` must take the next value from `dmain[nxt]`. Since `nxt` is the last element from `sv` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `dmain[nxt]` must have at least one more element remaining after the last iteration.

State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including `el` if `el` was not in `vis`, `vis` contains the value `1` and has `el` added if `el` was not in it, `res` now contains the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop, `nxt` is the last element from `sv`, and `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.**
