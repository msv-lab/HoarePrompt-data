Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including `el` if `el` was not in `vis`, `vis` contains the value `1` and has `el` added if `el` was not in it, `res` now contains the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop, and `nxt` has been assigned the last element from `sv` while ensuring that `dmain[nxt]` is non-empty. If `el` is in `vis`, then the state of these variables remains unchanged.***
