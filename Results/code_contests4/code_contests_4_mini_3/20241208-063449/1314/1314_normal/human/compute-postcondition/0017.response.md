Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `D` is an integer, `ds` is updated with `f` added to the set for key `s`, `s` is added to the set for key `f` in `ds`, `dmain[s]` now includes `f`, `dmain[f]` now includes `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` and `f` are assigned input integers. If `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, the set for key `s` in `ds` now includes `f`, and `ds[f]` now includes `s`.***
