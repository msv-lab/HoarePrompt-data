According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element beyond the current `el`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `el` is the current element in `ds[nxt]`. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is at least 2, we can assume that there are sufficient indices in `arr` and valid conditions to proceed. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `el` needs to be the next element in `ds[nxt]` after the current `el`. If `el` was the last element in `ds[nxt]`, then the loop cannot execute again. 

Thus, we need to adjust the states accordingly. If `el` has been processed, we will set `el` to the next index, which is assumed to be `el + 1`, and we need to check that `ds[nxt]` has enough elements to support this.

Assuming `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, the next `el` will be `el + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, and `tov` contains `el`, for the loop to execute a second time, `el` must be the next element in `ds[nxt]`, which is at least `el + 1`.**
