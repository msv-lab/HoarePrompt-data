`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 3. Since `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` and the element at index `el` is equal to 0, it is valid to assign 3 to `arr[el]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `tov`, `nxt`, and `ds[nxt]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains at least one element from `ds[nxt]` that was initially 0, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`, and `ds[nxt]` is not empty for the loop to execute.
