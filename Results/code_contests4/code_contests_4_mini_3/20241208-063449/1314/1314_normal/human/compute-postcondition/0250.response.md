Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` includes the element `el`, `vis` includes the next element in `dmain[nxt]` with the value `1`, and `vis` now also includes `el`. Additionally, `res` includes the strings 'YES', '<nxt> <next_el>', and 'nxt el', while `dmain[next_el]` no longer contains `nxt`, and `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element beyond the current `el` for the loop to execute a second time. If `el` is not in `vis`, then these updates are made; otherwise, the program remains unchanged.***
