The code assigns the value of `cur` (which is 2) to the index `el` in the list `arr`. Since `arr` has at least one index set to 2 and `cur` is 2, the value at `arr[el]` will be set to 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `cur` do not change, and the specific impact is on the list `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, and `arr[el]` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, and `arr[el]` is now 2.**
