The variable `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in the collection `tov` since `tov.pop()` removes and returns the last element. The values of `n`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, and `arr[2]` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` has one less element after the operation, and `arr[2]` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` has one less element, and `arr[2]` is now 2.**
