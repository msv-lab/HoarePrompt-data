The code `vis.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set `vis`. The current state indicates that `vis` already contains the value `1` and all other elements added during the loop iterations. Since `el` is not in `vis`, it will be included.

The other variables remain unaffected, and the previous values of `vis` indicate it will now contain one additional element, `el`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` now contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including `el`, `vis` now contains the value `1` and `el`, `res` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop, `nxt` has been assigned the last element from `sv`, `dmain[nxt]` is non-empty, and `el` is not in `vis` and now `el` has been added to `vis`.**
