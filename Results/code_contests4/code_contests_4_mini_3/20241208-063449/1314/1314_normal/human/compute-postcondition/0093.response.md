The code assigns a new set containing the current value of `i` to the variable `tov`. Since `i` was previously increased by 1, `tov` will now contain the value of `i`, which is 2 (assuming `i` was initially 1 before increment). The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` contains the value 2, and the loop continues.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` contains the value 2, and the loop continues.**
