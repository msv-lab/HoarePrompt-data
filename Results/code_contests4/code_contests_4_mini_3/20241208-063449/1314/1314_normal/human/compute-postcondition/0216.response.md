The code `sviaz.add(arr[el])` adds the value of `arr[el]` to the set `sviaz`. If `arr[el]` is not already present in `sviaz`, it will be included; otherwise, `sviaz` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found
- `arr` has been updated
- `sviaz` contains `arr[el]` if it was not in `sviaz`, otherwise remains an empty set
- `ite` has at least 2 elements
- `el` is the second element in `ite`

Since `sviaz` either already contains `arr[el]` or is empty, the output state reflects the current status of `sviaz` and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` is updated with `arr[el]` (if it was not present), `ite` has at least 2 elements, `el` is the second element in `ite`.**
