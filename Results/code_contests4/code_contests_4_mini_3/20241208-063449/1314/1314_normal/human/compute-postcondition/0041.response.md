The variable `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in the set `tov`, which is 2. The `pop()` method removes this element from the set, so `tov` will no longer contain the value 2 after this operation. The other variables `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` with the element at index 2 updated to 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, and `tov` is an empty set after popping the value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` with the element at index 2 updated to 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` is an empty set after popping the value 2, and `nxt` is 2.**
