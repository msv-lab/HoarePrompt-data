`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 2. Since `arr` has at least one index set to 2 and `el` is a valid index in `arr`, the value at the index `el` in `arr` will now be updated to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` contains `el`, and `arr[el]` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is at least 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` contains `el`, and `arr[el]` is now 2.**
