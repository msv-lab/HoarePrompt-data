According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element after the current iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the element `el`, and `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element remaining. Since the loop is iterating over `ds[nxt]`, if an element is consumed from `ds[nxt]`, the next execution will need `ds[nxt]` to have at least one more element than it had at the start of the current iteration.

After consuming an element from `ds[nxt]`, `el` will be the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `i` will increase by 1, reflecting that one element has been processed.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least the length of `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the next element `el`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element remaining, `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element in `tov` before popping, and if `arr[el]` was initially 0, then `arr[el]` is set to 1, for the loop to execute again `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element.**
