The variable `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element removed from the list `tov` using the `pop()` method. Since `tov` contains at least one element from `ds[nxt]` that was initially 0, we can conclude that `nxt` will now hold that value. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, with `arr[el]` being 3 for all elements in `ds[nxt]` that were initially 0, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains at least one element from `ds[nxt]` that was initially 0, `nxt` is now the last element from `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` is iterable containing elements that were processed in the loop.**
