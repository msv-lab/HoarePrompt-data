According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Since `i` has been increased by 1, the necessary condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than `i`. If `i` was previously less than `n`, then `n` must remain greater than `i` for the loop to continue. 

Thus, no other states need to be adjusted; we only need to ensure that the relationship holds. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is increased by 1, `cur` is set to 1, `tov` is empty, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than `i`**.
