According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sv`, which must have a length greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sv` contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations, and `nxt` is the last element from `sv`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sv` must contain at least one element.

Since `dmain[nxt]` must be empty or not contain any elements that would allow further iterations, we need to ensure that `sv` still has elements left after the last iteration. Therefore, we should adjust the state to indicate that `sv` contains at least one more element than it currently does.

State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations and for the loop to execute again, `sv` must contain at least one more element**.
