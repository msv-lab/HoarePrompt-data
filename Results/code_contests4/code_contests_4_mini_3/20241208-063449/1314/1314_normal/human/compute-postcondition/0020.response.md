According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, meaning it is now one more than its previous value. Since `m` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`. Given that `i` is incremented, the new value of `i` is now `i + 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than `i + 1`, `D` is an integer, `ds` is updated with `f` added to the set for key `s`, `s` is added to the set for key `f` in `ds`, `dmain[s]` now includes `f`, `dmain[f]` now includes `s`, `i` is `i + 1`**
