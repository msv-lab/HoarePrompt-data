Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` contains all elements that were added during the loop iterations including the added `el`, `vis` now contains the values `1` and the newly added element `el`, `res` contains the strings 'YES' and all pairs in the format '<nxt> <el>' for every element added, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were added during the loop, `nxt` is still the last element from `sv`, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`; a new entry added to `res` is '<nxt> <el>'.***
