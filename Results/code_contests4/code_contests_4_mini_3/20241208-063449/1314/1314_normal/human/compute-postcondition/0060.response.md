`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1. This means the element at index `el` in `arr` is now updated from 0 to 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` is not empty, `nxt` is assigned the last element from `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty, and the element at index `el` in `arr` is now 1.
