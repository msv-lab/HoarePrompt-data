According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `dmain[nxt]`. If `dmain[nxt]` contains more elements after the current iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains reachable values, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated, `sv` has one more element after adding `el`, `vis` now contains the element `el`, and a new entry has been added to `res` in the format 'nxt el' if `el` was not previously in `vis`. Additionally, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet. If the loop is currently processing `el`, the next element would be the next one in `dmain[nxt]`, and we can assume that `el` has been processed.

State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains reachable values, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated, `sv` has one more element after adding `el`, `vis` contains the element `el`, for the loop to execute one more time `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element not yet processed.**
