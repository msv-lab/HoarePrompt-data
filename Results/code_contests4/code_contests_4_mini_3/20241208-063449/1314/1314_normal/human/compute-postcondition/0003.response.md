The code initializes `ds` as a `defaultdict` where each key will hold a set. This does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `D`, but it creates a new data structure for storing graph edges. The initial state of the existing variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices; `m` is an integer representing the number of edges; `D` is an integer representing the required degree of the first vertex; `ds` is a defaultdict with sets.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices; `m` is an integer representing the number of edges; `D` is an integer representing the required degree of the first vertex; `ds` is a defaultdict with sets.**
