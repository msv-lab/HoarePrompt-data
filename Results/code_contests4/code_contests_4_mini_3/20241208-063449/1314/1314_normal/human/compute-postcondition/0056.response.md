To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `len(tov)`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following states:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `cur` is 1
- `tov` contains all elements `el` from `ds[2]` for which `arr[el]` was initially 0
- `nxt` is 2
- `arr` has been updated at indices in `tov` to 1

For the loop to execute again, `tov` must contain at least one element. Since `tov` contains elements that were initially in `ds[2]` and corresponding to `arr[el]` being 0, we need to ensure that at least one of those elements in `ds[2]` remains eligible for inclusion in `tov` for the next iteration.

However, since the specific contents of `tov` are not provided, we can only ascertain that `tov` must not be empty for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `tov` must have at least one element remaining.

We do not have enough information to modify the other states (`n`, `i`, `cur`, `nxt`, or `arr`) since they do not directly affect the condition of the while loop.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we can state that `tov` must contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains all elements `el` from `ds[2]` for which `arr[el]` was initially 0 and for the loop to execute again `tov` must not be empty**
