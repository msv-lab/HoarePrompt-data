The code assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` of the array `arr`. Given that `cur` is 3 and `arr[el]` was previously 0, after execution, `arr[el]` will now be 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` is empty after popping, `nxt` is at least 3, `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now 3.
