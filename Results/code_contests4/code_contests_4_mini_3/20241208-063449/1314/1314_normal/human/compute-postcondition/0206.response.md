The code initializes a new set called `sviaz`. This does not affect any existing variables (`i`, `cur`, `arr`, or `ds`). The state of these variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated such that each index reachable from the starting index 2 through the adjacency list `ds` has the same value as `cur`, and all other indices remain 0 if they were never reached, and a new empty set `sviaz` is created.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated such that each index reachable from the starting index 2 through the adjacency list `ds` has the same value as `cur`, and all other indices remain 0 if they were never reached; `sviaz` is an empty set.**
