Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the element `el`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 3 elements, and `el` is the third element in `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is updated to 1 and `el` is added to `tov`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `arr` or `tov`.***
