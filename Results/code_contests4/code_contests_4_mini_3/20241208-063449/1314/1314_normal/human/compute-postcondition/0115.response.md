The code assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` of the array `arr`. Since the initial state specifies that `cur` is 2, `arr[el]` will be updated to 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `tov`, `nxt`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` is updated, `nxt` is assigned the value of the removed element, and `arr[el]` is updated to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has at least one index set to 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` is updated, `nxt` is assigned the value of the removed element, `arr[el]` is updated to 2**.
