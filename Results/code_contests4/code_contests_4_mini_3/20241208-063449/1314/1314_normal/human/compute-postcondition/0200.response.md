The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state indicates that `i` has been increased by 1 without specifying its new value. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated for all indices in `ds` that were initially 0 to 3, `cur` is updated to 3, `tov` remains empty, indicating that all reachable elements have been processed, and `nxt` is no longer defined as `tov` is empty; variable `i` is increased by 1.**
