The line of code `dmain[f].add(s)` adds the value of `s` to the set associated with the key `f` in the dictionary `dmain`. This means that if `f` already exists as a key in `dmain`, `s` will be included in the set of values for that key. The initial states of `n`, `m`, `D`, and `ds` do not directly influence this operation. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `D`, and `ds` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `D` is an integer, `ds` is updated with `f` added to the set for key `s`, `s` is added to the set for key `f` in `ds`, `dmain[s]` now includes `f`, and `dmain[f]` now includes `s`.**
