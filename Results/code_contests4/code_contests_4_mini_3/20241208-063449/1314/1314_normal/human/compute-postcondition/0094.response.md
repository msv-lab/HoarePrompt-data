The value of `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`. Given that `i` is 2 and `cur` is also 2, the operation assigns the value 2 to `arr[2]`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `i`, and `tov`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` is 2, and `arr[2]` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `tov` is 2, and `arr[2]` is now 2.**
