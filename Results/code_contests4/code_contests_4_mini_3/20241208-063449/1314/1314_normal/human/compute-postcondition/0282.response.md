Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains reachable values, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated, `sv` has one less element, `nxt` is the popped element from `sv`. If `el` is not in `vis`, then `el` has been added to `sv`, `el` is now added to `vis`, and `res` now contains the string representation of `nxt` and `el` concatenated with a space. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.***
