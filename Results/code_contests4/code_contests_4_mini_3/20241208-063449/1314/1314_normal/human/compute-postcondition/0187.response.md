The `tov` list is updated to include the value `el`. Since `el` is an index and `arr` has been updated at this index to 3, the exact value of `el` is not specified, but it will be added to the `tov` list. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` now includes `el`, and `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el` to 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` now includes `el`, `nxt` points to a valid element in `ds`.**
