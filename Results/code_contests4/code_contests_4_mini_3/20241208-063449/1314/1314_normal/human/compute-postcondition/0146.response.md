According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and `i` is at least 3. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be strictly less than `n`. Since `i` is at least 3 and `n` is greater than 2, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to 4, ensuring that `i` (which is at least 3) is still less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is set to 2, and `tov` is empty, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3**
