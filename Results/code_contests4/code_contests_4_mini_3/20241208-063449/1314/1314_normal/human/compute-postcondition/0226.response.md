The command `sv = set()` initializes `sv` as an empty set. This does not affect the values of `i`, `cur`, `arr`, `sviaz`, `ite`, or `dmain[1]`. The variable `sv` is now defined but empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]` containing all elements that remained after removing those that were in `sviaz`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, and `sv` is an empty set.
