Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, with `arr[el]` being 3. The variable `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, and `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 2 elements, with `el` being the second element in `ds[nxt]`. The variable `tov` remains unchanged after attempting to add `el`.***
