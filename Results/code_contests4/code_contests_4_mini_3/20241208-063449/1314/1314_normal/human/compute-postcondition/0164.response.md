Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an array of length `n + 1`, with `arr[el]` being 3, `i` is at least 3, `cur` is 3, `tov` initially contains `el`, `nxt` is at least 3, `ds[nxt]` is iterable and contains at least 3 elements with `el` being the third element in `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `tov` now contains `el` added to it.***
