According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ite` list. If `ite` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `ite` has at least 2 elements, and `el` is the second element in `ite`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ite` must have at least 3 elements, `el` will be updated to the third element in the list, and the state of `cur`, `n`, `arr`, `sviaz`, and `dmain` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` is unchanged, `ite` has at least 3 elements, `el` is the third element in `ite`**
