Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, if `arr[el]` was not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` now contains `arr[el]`. Otherwise, `sviaz` remains an empty set, and `el` has been removed from `dmain[1]`. `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]` containing at least 1 element, and `el` is the first element in `ite`.***
