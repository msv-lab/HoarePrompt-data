The operation `res.append(str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el))` appends a string to the list `res`. The string consists of the values of `nxt` and `el`, separated by a space. The previous state indicates that `res` already contains the string 'YES'. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will contain an additional entry formulated from `nxt` and `el`.

The values of `nxt` and `el` are important here, but since they are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. However, we know they will be converted to strings and concatenated with a space in between.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated list `res`, which will now contain two entries: the original entry 'YES' and the newly appended string. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains all distinct values from `arr` that were reachable from `ite`, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated accordingly, `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` contains the value `1` and now includes `el`, `res` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and '<nxt> <el>', `dmain[nxt]` contains at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `dmain[nxt]`, and `el` is not in `vis` before the operation.**
