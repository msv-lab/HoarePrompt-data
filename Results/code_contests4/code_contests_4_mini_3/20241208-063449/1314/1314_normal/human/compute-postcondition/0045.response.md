The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Since `tov` is initially an empty set, and `el` is the index in `arr` where the value is now 1, the output state will reflect that `el` is now included in the set `tov`.

Since `n`, `i`, `cur`, `nxt`, and `ds[2]` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` is 2, `ds[2]` contains at least one element, the element at index `el` in `arr` is now 1.**
