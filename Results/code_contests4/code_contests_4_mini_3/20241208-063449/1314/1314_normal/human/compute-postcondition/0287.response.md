The code `res.append(str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el))` appends a string to the list `res`. The string is formed by concatenating the string representation of `nxt` and the string representation of `el`, separated by a space. The values of `nxt` and `el` are not specified, but they are assumed to be defined in the context. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the number of distinct connected components found, `arr` has been updated, `sviaz` contains reachable values, `ite` is a copy of `dmain[1]`, `dmain[1]` has been updated, `sv` has one more element after adding `el`, `vis` now contains the element `el`, and a new entry has been added to `res` in the format 'nxt el'.**
