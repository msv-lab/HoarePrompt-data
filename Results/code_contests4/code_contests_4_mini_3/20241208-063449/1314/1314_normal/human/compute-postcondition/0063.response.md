According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute for a third time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the element `el`, and `nxt` is assigned the last element from `tov`. The last iteration also ensures that `ds[nxt]` is not empty. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `el` should be the third element in `ds[nxt]`, and `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3, and for the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the element `el`, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 3 elements, and `el` is the third element in `ds[nxt]`**
