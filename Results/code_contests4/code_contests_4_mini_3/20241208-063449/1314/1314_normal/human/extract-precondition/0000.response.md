Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(200,000, (n(n-1))/2)), and D is an integer representing the required degree of the first vertex (1 ≤ D < n). The subsequent m lines contain pairs of integers (v_i, u_i) representing edges between vertices (1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), and there are no self-loops or multiple edges.**
