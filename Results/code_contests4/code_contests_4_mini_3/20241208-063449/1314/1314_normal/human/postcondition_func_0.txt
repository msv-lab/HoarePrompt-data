The function analyzes a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges to determine if the first vertex can achieve a degree of at least `D`. If the degree of vertex 1 is less than `D`, it prints 'NO' and exits. It also checks the number of distinct connected components in the graph, and if this number exceeds `D`, it again prints 'NO' and exits. If both conditions are satisfied, it constructs and prints a representation of the connections starting from vertex 1. If there are any vertices connected to vertex 1 that would create duplicates in the connections, those edges are removed accordingly before printing the result. The function ultimately returns 'YES' followed by the connections if the conditions are met.
