To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we will examine the requirements and check if the program adheres to them for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input**: Two integers `p` (the length of the number) and `x` (the multiplier).
2. **Output**: A strictly positive number of exactly `p` digits that does not have leading zeroes, and moving the last digit to the front makes it exactly `x` times larger. If no such number exists, output "Impossible".

### Potential Issues in the Program:
- The function `func_1` is designed to construct potential numbers based on the conditions. It uses a loop to find valid digits, but there is no check for cases where `p` is not a multiple of the length of the valid number found.
- The outer function `func_2` includes a specific case for when `x == 5` and `p % 42 == 0`. This is hardcoded and may not handle other cases correctly.
- In the output logic inside `func_2`, there is an assumption that if a valid number is found, it will always be possible to repeat it enough times to achieve length `p`. However, if the number's length does not divide `p` evenly, it should return "Impossible" instead of just printing the number multiple times.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input `p = 3` and `x = 2`. 
1. The expected output should be a 3-digit number that when the last digit is moved to the front becomes double the original.
2. The valid number "150" works since moving '0' to the front gives "015" which is not valid due to leading zero.
3. Therefore, the program should output "Impossible" for this case, but it might not handle this correctly due to the logic flaws in handling lengths.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the validation of the conditions sufficiently, especially regarding cases where the resulting number does not meet the required format or length. 

Correctness: **False**.
