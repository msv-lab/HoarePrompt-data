The code contains the `continue` statement, which does not change any variable values but causes the loop to skip the rest of its current iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same, indicating that we are continuing the loop with the current variable values.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `i` is 1, `s` is assigned the value of func_1(i, x), and `s` is not true (or evaluates to false), and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
