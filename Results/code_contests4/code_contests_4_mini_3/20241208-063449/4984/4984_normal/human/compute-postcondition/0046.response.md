To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we need to analyze how the variables are affected:

1. The variables `b` and `s` are involved in the expression `divmod(b * x + s, 10)`. Here, `x` is not defined in the initial state, meaning we cannot calculate `b * x + s` directly. 

2. The initial values are:
   - `b` is 3
   - `s` is 0

3. Since `x` is not provided, we cannot compute `b * x + s`. Therefore, we cannot determine the result of the `divmod` operation or the new values of `s` and `b`.

4. As a result, the output state will reflect that we cannot perform the operation due to the undefined variable `x`.

Output State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [3, 3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 1, and we cannot compute `s, b` due to the undefined variable `x`.**
