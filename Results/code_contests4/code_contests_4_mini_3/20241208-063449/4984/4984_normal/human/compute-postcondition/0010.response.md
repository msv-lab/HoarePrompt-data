The variable `s` is assigned the value of `func_1(i, x)`, which is a function call that presumably returns a value. The impact of the code `l = len(s)` is that `l` is assigned the length of `s`. The previous state of the variables does not change except for the assignment of `l`. The specific value of `s` is not provided, but it can be inferred that it is some kind of collection or string whose length can be calculated.

Therefore, the output state reflects the information about the variables `p`, `x`, `i`, and `s`, and the new variable `l` which depends on `s`.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `i` is 1, `s` is assigned the value of func_1(i, x), and `l` is the length of `s`.**
