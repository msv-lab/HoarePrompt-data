According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the integer `p`. If `j` is less than `p`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `p` is a strictly positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `p` must be greater than 1.

State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 2, `s` is updated, `b` is updated, the list `a` contains the element 2, `c` contains one element which is '2', `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 1**
