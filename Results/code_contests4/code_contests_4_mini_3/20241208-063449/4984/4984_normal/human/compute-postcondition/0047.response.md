According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit defined by `p`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `p` is a strictly positive integer, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `p` must be greater than 2.

State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [3, 3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 2**
