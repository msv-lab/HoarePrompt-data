To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the variables involved:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `p` is a strictly positive integer.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `b` is 3.
   - `a` is [3, 3, 3].
   - `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times (which gives us a list of length `p + 1` with '2's).
   - `j` is 2.
   - `x` is not defined in the initial state, but for the operation to proceed, we can assume `x` is another variable that needs to be defined or is implicitly understood.

2. Since `x` is not defined, we can't compute `b * x + s` accurately. However, if we assume a generic representation for `x`, we can analyze the operation:
   - The expression `b * x + s` can be computed as `3 * x + 0` which simplifies to `3 * x`.

3. The `divmod` function divides the first argument by the second and returns a tuple containing the quotient and the remainder. Here, we are dividing by `10`.

4. Thus, the output of `divmod(b * x + s, 10)` will yield:
   - `s` will be updated to the quotient of `(3 * x) // 10`.
   - `b` will be updated to the remainder of `(3 * x) % 10`.

5. Therefore, the output state will depend on the particular value of `x`. However, since no value for `x` is provided, the output state will reflect the unknown nature of `x`:

Output State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is updated to (3 * x) // 10, `b` is updated to (3 * x) % 10, `a` is [3, 3, 3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 2**.
