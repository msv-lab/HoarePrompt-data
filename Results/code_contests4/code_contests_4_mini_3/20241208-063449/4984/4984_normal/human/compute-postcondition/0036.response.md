Postcondition: ***`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 2, `s` is updated based on the final calculation after all iterations, `b` is updated based on the final calculation after all iterations, the list `a` contains `p` elements of the form 2 (in reversed order), `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, and `j` is `p - 1`. If `b` is equal to `i` and `s` is 0, then this state is preserved.***
