According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `p`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `p` is a strictly positive integer, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. Thus, the new value of `j` will be 1.

State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `p` must remain greater than 1.**
