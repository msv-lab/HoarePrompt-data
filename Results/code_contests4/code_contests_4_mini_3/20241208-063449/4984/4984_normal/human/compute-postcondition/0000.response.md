The variables `p` and `x` are assigned values from the input. The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function takes a line of input, splits it into separate values, converts those values to integers, and assigns them to `p` and `x`. The previous values of `p` and `x` are unknown, but we know that `p` is a positive integer and `x` is an integer between 1 and 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer; `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 based on the input provided.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer; `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 based on the input provided.**
