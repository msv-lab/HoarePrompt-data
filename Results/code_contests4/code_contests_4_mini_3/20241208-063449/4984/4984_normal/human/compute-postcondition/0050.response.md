To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop and its effects on the variables involved. Given that `p` is a strictly positive integer, the loop will execute `p` times.

1. **Starting Values:**
   - `s` starts at 0.
   - `b` starts at 3.
   - `a` starts as an empty list.
   - The loop iterates `p` times, appending `b` to `a` on each iteration.

2. **Effects of Each Loop Iteration:**
   - In each iteration, `b` (which is 3 at the start) is appended to the list `a`. So, after `p` iterations, `a` will contain the value 3 repeated `p` times.
   - The values of `s` and `b` are updated using the expression `s, b = divmod(b * x + s, 10)`. However, since the variable `x` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact values of `s` and `b` after the loop ends. Nevertheless, we can denote that `s` will be updated based on the logic in the loop.

3. **Final Values After `p` Iterations:**
   - `a` will contain `[3, 3, ..., 3]` (repeated `p` times).
   - The final values of `s` and `b` are unknown due to the undefined variable `x`, but they will be computed based on the last iteration of the loop.

Thus, the output state reflects the known values and the unknowns from the loop.

Output State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is updated based on the last iteration, `b` is updated based on the last iteration, `a` is a list containing 3 repeated `p` times, `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is `p - 1`.**
