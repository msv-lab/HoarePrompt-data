The code `c.append(''.join(map(str, a)))` takes the list `a`, which contains three elements, all equal to `p`, and converts each element to a string using `map(str, a)`. Then, `''.join(...)` concatenates these string elements together into a single string. This resulting string is appended to the list `c`.

Since `a` is `[p, p, p]`, the resulting string will be `str(p) + str(p) + str(p)`, which is equivalent to the string representation of `p` repeated three times.

The initial state indicates that `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times. After the execution of the code, one additional string is appended to `c`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `c` which now contains three elements: the original two elements and the new string from the concatenation.

Output State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [p, p, p], `c` contains three elements: '2', '2' repeated `p` times, and the string representation of `p` repeated three times, `j` is `p - 1`**.
