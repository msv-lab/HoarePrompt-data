The code `a.append(b)` appends the current value of `b`, which is 2, to the list `a`. Initially, `a` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `a` will contain one element with the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `b` is 2, the list `a` contains the element 2, `c` contains one element which is the concatenated string of the original `a` values (which is now '2'), and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `b` is 2, the list `a` contains the element 2, `c` contains one element which is '2', and `j` is 0**.
