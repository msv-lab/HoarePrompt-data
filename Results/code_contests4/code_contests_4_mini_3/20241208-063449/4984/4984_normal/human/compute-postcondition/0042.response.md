In the provided code snippet, `a.append(b)` adds the current value of `b` to the list `a`. The previous value of `b` is 3, and since `a` is initially an empty list, after the execution of the code, `a` will contain one element, which is the value of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 0.**
