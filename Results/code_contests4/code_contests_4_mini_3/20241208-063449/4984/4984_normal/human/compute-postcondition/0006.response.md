The function `func_1` is called with parameters `i` and `x`. The value of `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 9. The output of `func_1(i, x)` is assigned to `s`. However, since we do not have the definition or return value of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. 

Thus, the output state reflects the assignment and the current values of the other variables without knowing the specific outcome of `s`.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `i` is 1, `s` is assigned the value of func_1(i, x)**
