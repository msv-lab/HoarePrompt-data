According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `xrange(1, 1000)`. The loop will continue until `i` reaches 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still within the range and can be incremented. Since `xrange(1, 1000)` generates values from 1 to 999, `i` at the end of the last iteration must be 999. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1000, which is the end of the range.

State: **The program does not return any value as the return statement is empty, `i` is 1000, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 1000**
