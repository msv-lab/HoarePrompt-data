The code `a.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the end of the list `a`. The current value of `b` is 3, so after execution, the list `a` will now contain an additional element with the value 3. The previous state of `a` is `[3, 3]`, so after the append operation, `a` will become `[3, 3, 3]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [3, 3, 3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 2**
