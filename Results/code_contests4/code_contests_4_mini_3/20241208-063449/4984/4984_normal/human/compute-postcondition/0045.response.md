The list `a` is modified by appending the value of `b` to it. The current value of `b` is 3, and `a` initially contains one element, which is also 3. After executing the code, `a` will contain two elements: the original 3 and the newly appended 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [3, 3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is [3, 3], `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 1**
