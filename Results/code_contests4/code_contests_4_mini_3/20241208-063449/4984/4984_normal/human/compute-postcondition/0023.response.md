Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters: a positive integer `p` (representing the length of a decimal number) and an integer `x` (between 1 and 9). It checks if `x` is 5 and if `p` is divisible by 42. If both conditions are met, it writes the result of `func_1(42, 5)` multiplied by `p / 42`. If not, it iterates through integers from 1 to 999, calling `func_1(i, x)` and checking if the result is non-empty. If the length of the result divides `p`, it writes the result repeated `p / l` times; otherwise, it writes 'Impossible'. If none of these conditions are met, the function ultimately does not return any specific value.**
