Postcondition: ***`p` is a strictly positive integer, `c` contains at least 2 valid strings, and `r` is the second valid string in `c`. If the first character of `r` is not '0', the function does not return anything. Otherwise, the function returns the string `r`, which starts with the character '0'.***
