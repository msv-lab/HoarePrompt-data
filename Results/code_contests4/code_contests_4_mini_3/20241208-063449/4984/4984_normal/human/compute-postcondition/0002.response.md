To evaluate the output state, we need to analyze the Python code provided in relation to the initial state.

1. The `stdout.write(func_1(42, 5) * (p / 42))` line indicates that a function named `func_1` is being called with the arguments 42 and 5.
2. The variable `x` is equal to 5, which is directly passed to the function as the second argument.
3. The variable `p` is a positive integer that is divisible by 42, meaning that `p` could be any multiple of 42 (like 42, 84, 126, etc.).
4. The output of the function `func_1(42, 5)` will be multiplied by `(p / 42)`. Since `p` is divisible by 42, the division will yield a positive integer.

However, since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine its output. Therefore, the output state will reflect the known aspects of the variables and the operation being performed.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer divisible by 42, `x` is equal to 5, and `stdout.write` is called with the result of `func_1(42, 5) * (p / 42)`**.
