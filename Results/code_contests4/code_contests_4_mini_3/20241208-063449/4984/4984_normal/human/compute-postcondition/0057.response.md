According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. The loop will execute if `c` contains at least one valid string. Given that `p` is a strictly positive integer, it ensures that valid strings of length `p` can be formed. However, it is essential to note that `c` must not be empty for the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, `r` will be set to the first element in `c` when it executes. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `c` should contain at least one valid string. 

State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, for the loop to execute the first time `c` contains at least 1 valid string, and `r` is the first valid string in `c`**
