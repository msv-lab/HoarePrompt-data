According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `p`, which must be greater than 0 for the range to contain any values. The variable `j` is initialized to `p - 1`, but it will be overwritten by the loop's iteration variable on the first execution of the loop. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `p` is indeed a strictly positive integer, which is already given. Thus, it guarantees that `j` will take the values from 0 to `p - 1`. 

At the start of the loop, `i` is already set to 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is an empty list, and `c` contains elements. The initial values of `j` and the other variables do not need modification for the loop to execute, as `j` will be set to 0 on the first iteration.

State: **`p` is a strictly positive integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, `a` is an empty list, `c` contains two elements: '2' and '2' repeated `p` times, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
