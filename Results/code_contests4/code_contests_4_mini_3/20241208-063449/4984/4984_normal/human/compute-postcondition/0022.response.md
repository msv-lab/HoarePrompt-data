The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `p`, which is a positive integer representing the length of the decimal number, and `x`, which is an integer between 1 and 9. After executing the function body, there are two cases to consider. 

In Case 1, the function does not return any specific value as the return statement is empty. In Case 2, the function also does not return any value as the return statement is empty, and it involves additional variables (`i` and `s`) but still results in no return value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `p` and an integer `x` between 1 and 9, but it does not return any value in both cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters p (a positive integer) and x (an integer between 1 and 9), but does not return any value.**
