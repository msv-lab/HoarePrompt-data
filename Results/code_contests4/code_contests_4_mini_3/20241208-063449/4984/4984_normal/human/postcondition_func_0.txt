The function accepts a strictly positive integer `p`, representing the length of a decimal number, and a positive integer `x`. It generates all valid strings of length `p` formed by the digits 1 to 9, where each string starts and ends with the same digit and is generated through a specific multiplication and summation process. The function returns the first valid string that does not start with '0', or an empty string if no valid strings are found. It does not handle cases where valid strings may start with '0' after sorting since the return condition explicitly checks for strings starting with '0' as invalid.
