Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when `p` is 1 correctly. In the problem description, it states that a strictly positive number cannot contain leading zeroes and that for a single digit, it cannot stay what it is when multiplied by any number greater than 1 (e.g., `x` values of 2 through 9). 

Specifically, the annotation for `func_2` mentions that if `x` is 5 and `p` is divisible by 42, a valid number is generated, but it does not cover the case of `p = 1` comprehensively. When `p` is 1 and `x` is greater than 1, the output should be "Impossible", but the function does not explicitly handle this case as it would return an empty string for `func_1(1, x)` where `x > 1` and would then imply a valid digit from 1-9 can be produced.

For example, if the input is `p = 1` and `x = 2`, the output should be "Impossible" due to the reasons outlined, but based on the current code logic, it might not return that correctly, leading to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
