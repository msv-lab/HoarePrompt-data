You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Teacher thinks that we make a lot of progress. Now we are even allowed to use decimal notation instead of counting sticks. After the test the teacher promised to show us a "very beautiful number". But the problem is, he's left his paper with the number in the teachers' office.

The teacher remembers that the "very beautiful number" was strictly positive, didn't contain any leading zeroes, had the length of exactly p decimal digits, and if we move the last digit of the number to the beginning, it grows exactly x times. Besides, the teacher is sure that among all such numbers the "very beautiful number" is minimal possible.

The teachers' office isn't near and the teacher isn't young. But we've passed the test and we deserved the right to see the "very beautiful number". Help to restore the justice, find the "very beautiful number" for us!

Input

The single line contains integers p, x (1 ≤ p ≤ 106, 1 ≤ x ≤ 9).

Output

If the teacher's made a mistake and such number doesn't exist, then print on a single line "Impossible" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the "very beautiful number" without leading zeroes.

Examples

Input

6 5


Output

142857

Input

1 2


Output

Impossible


Input

6 4


Output

102564

Note

Sample 1: 142857·5 = 714285.

Sample 2: The number that consists of a single digit cannot stay what it is when multiplied by 2, thus, the answer to the test sample is "Impossible".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a strictly positive integer representing the length of the decimal number (1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6), and x is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 9).
def func_1(p, x):
    c = []
    for i in xrange(1, 10):
        s = 0
        
        b = i
        
        a = []
        
        for j in xrange(p):
            a.append(b)
            s, b = divmod(b * x + s, 10)
        
        if b == i and s == 0:
            a.reverse()
            c.append(''.join(map(str, a)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a strictly positive integer, `c` contains all valid strings of length `p` that can be formed by the digits 1 to 9, where each string starts and ends with the same digit and is formed by repeatedly multiplying by `x` and summing the previous digits.
    c.sort()
    for r in c:
        if r[0] != '0':
            return r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a strictly positive integer, `c` contains valid strings of length `p`, and `r` is the first valid string in `c` that starts with a digit from 1 to 9.
    return ''
    #The program returns an empty string ''

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a positive integer representing the length of the decimal number, and x is an integer between 1 and 9.
def func_2():
    p, x = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if (x == 5 and p % 42 == 0) :
        stdout.write(func_1(42, 5) * (p / 42))
        return
        #The program returns no specific value as the return statement is empty
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`p` is a positive integer; `x` is an integer between 1 and 9. Either `x` is not equal to 5, or `p` is not divisible by 42.
    for i in xrange(1, 1000):
        s = func_1(i, x)
        
        if not s:
            continue
        
        l = len(s)
        
        if p % l == 0:
            stdout.write(s * (p / l))
        else:
            stdout.write('Impossible')
        
        return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The program does not return any value as the return statement is empty, `i` is 1000, `s` is the result of func_1(999, x), and `p` is a positive integer.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
