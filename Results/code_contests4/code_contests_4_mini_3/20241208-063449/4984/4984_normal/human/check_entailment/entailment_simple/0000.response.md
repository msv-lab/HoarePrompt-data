To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program meets all the requirements specified.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The program must find a strictly positive number with exactly `p` decimal digits.
2. The number should not contain leading zeros.
3. Moving the last digit of the number to the front should result in a number that is exactly `x` times the original number.
4. Among all such numbers, it must return the minimal possible "very beautiful number".
5. If no such number exists, it should return "Impossible".

### Program Analysis:
The program is divided into two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(p, x)`**:
   - It iterates over the digits 1 to 9 (the possible last digits).
   - For each digit, it constructs potential numbers by moving the last digit to the front and checks if the resulting number is equal to `x` times the original number.
   - If valid numbers are found, they are stored in a list `c`, which is sorted and the first valid number is returned.
   - If no valid number is found, it returns an empty string.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads input values for `p` and `x`.
   - It handles a special case where if `x` equals 5 and `p` is divisible by 42, it directly calls `func_1` with `p = 42` and `x = 5`.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 999, calling `func_1` for each value of `i` to find a valid number.
   - If a valid number is found, it checks if `p` can be constructed by repeating this number. If not, it returns "Impossible".
   - The output is written directly rather than returned.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Leading Zeros**: The program ensures that numbers formed do not start with a zero, as it starts with digits 1 to 9.
- **Strictly Positive**: The output will be strictly positive since it avoids zero and directly checks for valid numbers.
- **Length Check**: The program constructs numbers based on the length `p` and checks if they can be repeated to match this length.
- **Number Movement and Multiplication**: The logic for moving the last digit and multiplying by `x` is appropriately implemented in `func_1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Digit Case**: The program correctly identifies that it's impossible to have a single-digit number that satisfies the multiplication condition for `x > 1`, as shown in the example input (1, 2).
- **Large Values of p**: The program handles large values of `p` up to 10^6, as it is designed to work within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately. It correctly identifies when a valid "very beautiful number" can be formed and returns the minimal valid number or "Impossible" when necessary.

Correctness: **True**
