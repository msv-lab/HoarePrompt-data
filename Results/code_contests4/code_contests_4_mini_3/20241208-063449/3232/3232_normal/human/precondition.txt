The input consists of multiple datasets, each starting with an integer n (0 < n <= 10,000) indicating the number of trains. For each train, there are n lines containing two time strings in the format hh:mm:ss, representing the departure and arrival times at Osaki Station. Each time value is guaranteed to be within the range 0 ≤ hh < 24, 0 ≤ mm < 60, 0 ≤ ss < 60, and the departure time is always before the arrival time. The input ends with n = 0, which is not included in the datasets.
