The variable `a` is split by the colon character and mapped to integers, resulting in three variables being assigned values corresponding to the parts of the input string. The values of `b` and `c` are assigned based on the split string, while `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, which depend on the input provided by the user.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `a`, `b`, `c` are the integer parts obtained from splitting the input string provided by the user.**
