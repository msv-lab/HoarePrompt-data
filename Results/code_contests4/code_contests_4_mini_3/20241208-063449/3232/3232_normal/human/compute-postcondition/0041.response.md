The line of code `a, b, c = map(int, a.split(':'))` splits the string `a` using the colon `:` as a delimiter, converting the resulting parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state indicates that `a` holds a raw input string, which has been split into three components.

The previous value of `a` is a string that contains values separated by colons, which will now be converted into three integers. The values of `b` and `c` were not defined prior to this operation, but they will now hold the respective integer values obtained from the split operation.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` now contain integer values derived from the input string. 

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to all 0s, `n` is greater than 0, loop variable is 0; `a`, `b`, `c` are integers obtained from splitting the original string `a` by colons.**
