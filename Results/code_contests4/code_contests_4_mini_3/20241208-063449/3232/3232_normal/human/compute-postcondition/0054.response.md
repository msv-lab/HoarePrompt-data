The line of code `d, e, f = map(int, d.split(':'))` takes the string `d`, splits it by the colon `:`, and converts each part into an integer. The previous state indicates that `d` is a string that presumably contains parts separated by colons. The values of `b` and `c` are not affected by this operation, and the specific input string `d` is necessary to determine the values of `d`, `e`, and `f`. However, since the input string is unspecified, the output state will reflect the transformation that occurs.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `a` is the input string; `b` is the first part as an integer; `c` is the second part as an integer; `d`, `e`, `f` are assigned integer values from the split parts of string `d`.**
