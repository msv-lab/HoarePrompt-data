The code initializes a list `dp` with a size of `m + 1`, where `m` is 86400. This means `dp` will be a list with 86401 elements, all set to 0. The previous values of other variables are not affected, and since `n` does not play a role in this line of code, we ignore it for this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400; `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to zeros.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to zeros.**
