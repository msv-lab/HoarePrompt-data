In this case, the code snippet `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]` indicates that we are updating the value at index `i + 1` of the list `dp` by adding to it the current value at index `i`. Given the initial state, we have `m` is 86400 and `i` is 2.

Since we don't have specific values for the `dp` list, we will assume it has been initialized appropriately and contains values at least up to index 3 (because we're accessing `dp[i + 1]` which is `dp[3]`).

Now, focusing on the operation:

- `dp[i]` refers to `dp[2]`.
- The operation will add the value of `dp[2]` to `dp[3]`.

The values of `m` and `i` do not directly affect the state of `dp`, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the operation performed on the `dp` list.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2, `dp[3]` is updated to be `dp[3] + dp[2]`**.
