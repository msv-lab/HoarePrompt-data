The code `a, d = raw_input().split()` takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns those parts to the variables `a` and `d`. The previous value of `m` is not affected by this operation. Since `m` is 86400, it remains unchanged. The variables `a` and `d` will hold the values provided by the user input, but we do not know what those values are.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `a` and `d` are the two parts of the input provided by the user.**
