The value of `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by `dp[i]`. However, the values of `dp` have not been defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the effect on `dp[i + 1]` or `dp[i]`. The variable `m` is not affected by this operation, and `i` remains 1 after execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that the operation was attempted but without defined values for `dp`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, and `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by `dp[i]`, but `dp` values are undefined.**
