The value of `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by `dp[i]`. Since `i` is 0, this means `dp[1]` will be updated with the value of `dp[0]`. The variable `m`, which is 86400, and `i`, which is 0, remain unchanged. The list `dp` is affected by the update, specifically `dp[1]` is now `dp[1] + dp[0]`. 

However, since the previous value of `dp[0]` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine an exact numerical result for `dp[1]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the impact on `dp` without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 0; `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] + dp[0]`**.
