The code initializes `dp` as a list containing `m + 1` zeros, where `m` is 86400. This means that `dp` will now contain 86401 elements, all set to 0. The previous values of `dp[0]` and `dp[m]` remain unchanged, but now they are part of a larger list of zeros. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400; `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros; `dp[0]` remains unchanged; `dp[m]` is 0; the maximum value in `dp` is 0; and if `n` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros; `dp[0]` remains unchanged; `dp[m]` is 0; the maximum value in `dp` is 0; and if `n` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
