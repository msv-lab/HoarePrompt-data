Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely unless it is interrupted by a break statement or an external condition. Therefore, there are no specific conditions that need to be met for the loop to execute its first iteration. 

Thus, the state right before the loop can remain unchanged.

State: **`m` is 86400 seconds**
