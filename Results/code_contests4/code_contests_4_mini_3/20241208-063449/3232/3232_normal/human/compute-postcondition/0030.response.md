According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is 86400, which means the loop can still execute since `i` is less than `m`. After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `m` which is still true since 2 is less than 86400. 

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**
