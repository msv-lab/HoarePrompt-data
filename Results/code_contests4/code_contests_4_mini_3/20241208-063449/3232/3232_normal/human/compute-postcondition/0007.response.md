According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The states before the loop indicate that `m` is 86400 and `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to zeros, which does not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
