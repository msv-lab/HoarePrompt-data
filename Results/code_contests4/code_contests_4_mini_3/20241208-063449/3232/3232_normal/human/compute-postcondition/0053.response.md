The code snippet takes the input string `a`, splits it by the colon `:`, and then maps the resulting parts to integers, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `m` remains unchanged at 86400. The previous value of `a` is the input string, which will be split into three parts.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400; `a` is the input string, `b` is the first part as an integer, and `c` is the second part as an integer from the input string.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `a` is the input string, `b` is the first part as an integer, and `c` is the second part as an integer from the input string.**
