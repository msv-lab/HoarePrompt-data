`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is 86400 seconds, `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`m` is 86400 seconds, `n` is an input integer**
