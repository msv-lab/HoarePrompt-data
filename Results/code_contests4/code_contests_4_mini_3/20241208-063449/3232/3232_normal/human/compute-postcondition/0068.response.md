The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `dp` contains cumulative sums up to each index, `dp[m]` is the total sum of the initial values in `dp`, `dp[0]` remains unchanged; the maximum value in `dp` is printed, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
