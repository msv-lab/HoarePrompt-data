The code `a, b, c = map(int, a.split(':'))` splits the string `a` at the colons, converting the resulting substrings into integers, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial value of `a` is a string representing a time format, such as "hh:mm:ss". 

Given the initial state, the values of `b` and `c` will depend on the specific string format of `a`. However, since the exact input for `a` is not provided, we can only express the output in a general form.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to zeros, `a` is now the first part of the input time as an integer, `b` is the second part of the input time as an integer, `c` is the third part of the input time as an integer.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to zeros, `a` is now the first part of the input time as an integer, `b` is the second part of the input time as an integer, `c` is the third part of the input time as an integer.**
