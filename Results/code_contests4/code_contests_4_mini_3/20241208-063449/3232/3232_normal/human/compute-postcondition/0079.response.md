The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, a.split(':'))` takes the string `a`, splits it by the colon character `:`, and converts each split string into an integer. The values of `b` and `c` are assigned based on the results of this conversion. The initial state of `m` and `dp` is not affected by this operation as they are unrelated to the variables being manipulated. The final output state reflects the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, `a` is the first part of the input string converted to an integer, `b` is the second part of the input string converted to an integer, `c` is the third part of the input string converted to an integer.**
