The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which means `n` will hold an integer value input by the user. The variable `m` remains unchanged at 86400. Since `dp` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine if it has any impact on the cumulative sum of occurrences or the output. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `n` and the unchanged value of `m`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `n` is an input integer**
