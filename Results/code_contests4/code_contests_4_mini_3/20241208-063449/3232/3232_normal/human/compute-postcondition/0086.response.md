In the provided code snippet, `d` is expected to be a string formatted as `H:M:S`, where `H`, `M`, and `S` are hours, minutes, and seconds respectively. The `map(int, d.split(':'))` function splits the string `d` at the colons and converts the resulting parts into integers, assigning them to `d`, `e`, and `f`.

Since `d`, `e`, and `f` are directly assigned from the split values of `d`, the output will reflect the integer representations of the hours, minutes, and seconds from the input string. The variables `m`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state will include the values of `d`, `e`, and `f` as the integer parts obtained from the split operation, while `m`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their previous values.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `a`, `b`, `c` are the integer parts obtained from splitting the input string; `d`, `e`, `f` are the integer parts of the time obtained from `d.split(':')`**.
