According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is 86400. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `i` will be 2. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `m`, and since `m` is 86400, the condition will still hold true.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**
