According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is 86400. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop can execute again as 1 is still less than 86400.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 1**
