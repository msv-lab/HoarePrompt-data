The code `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]` updates the value of `dp[i + 1]` by adding the current value of `dp[i]` to it. The variable `i` is currently 2, so the index being updated is `dp[3]`. However, we do not have information about the value of `dp[i]` (which is `dp[2]`), so we cannot determine the specific value of `dp[3]` after the operation. The value of `m` is 86400, and since it is greater than 2, the loop can execute again, but this specific line of code does not impact the values of `m` or `i` directly.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `i` is 2, and `dp[3]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[2]` (unknown) to it.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2, and `dp[3]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[2]` (unknown) to it.**
