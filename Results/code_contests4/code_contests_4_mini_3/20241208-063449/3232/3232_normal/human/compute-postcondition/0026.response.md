According to the code, the loop will execute a total of `m` times, where `m` is set to 86400. This means that the loop will iterate from 0 to 86399. Thus, the following states need to be established for the loop to execute successfully:

1. The variable `i` will start at 0 on the first iteration and increment by 1 on each subsequent iteration until it reaches 86399.
2. The value of `m` is already set to 86400, which is appropriate for the loop to run for the full range of seconds in a day.

Since there are no additional conditions specified that would affect the execution of the loop based on the state of `dp`, we can conclude that as long as `m` is 86400, the loop will execute correctly.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
