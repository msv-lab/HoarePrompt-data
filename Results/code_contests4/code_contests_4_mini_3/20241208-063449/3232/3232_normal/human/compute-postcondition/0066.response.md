Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to make any adjustments to the state. 

State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` contains cumulative sums up to each index, `dp[m]` is the total sum of the initial values in `dp`, and `dp[0]` remains unchanged; the maximum value in `dp` is printed.**
