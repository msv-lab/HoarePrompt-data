The variable `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`. Since `i` is currently 1, this means `dp[2]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[1]` to it. The initial state does not provide the values for `dp`, so we cannot specify the exact outcome for `dp[2]`. The other variables `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `i` is 1, and `dp[2]` is updated by adding `dp[1]`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, and `dp[2]` is updated by adding `dp[1]`.**
