In the given code, `a` and `d` are assigned values from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which splits the input string into two parts. The initial state indicates that `m` is 86400 and `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros. However, the values of `a` and `d` will depend on the input provided, which is not specified here. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `a` and `d`.

The states of the other variables (`m` and `dp`) remain unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect the uncertainty of the input while confirming the values of `m` and `dp`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros; `a` and `d` are assigned from input.**
