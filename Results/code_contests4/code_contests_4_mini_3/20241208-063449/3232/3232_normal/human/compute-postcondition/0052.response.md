The values of `a` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which takes input and splits it into two parts. The previous value of `m` (86400) is unaffected, and since there are no operations on `n` or `current_iteration` in this snippet, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `a` is an input string, `d` is an input string.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `a` is an input string, `d` is an input string**.
