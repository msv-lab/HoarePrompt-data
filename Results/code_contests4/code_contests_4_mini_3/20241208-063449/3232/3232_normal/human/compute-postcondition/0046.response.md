The code assigns values to `a` and `d` from the input received via `raw_input()`. The impact on the program is that `a` will hold a string value and `d` will hold another string value which represents a part of the time split by colons. Since `d` is used in the context of previously obtaining integer values from a string split, it is now reassigned, and its previous value is unknown. The output state will reflect that `a` is a string input and `d` is a new string input, but does not provide specific integer values for `d` since it can vary based on input. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to all 0s, `n` is greater than 1, loop variable is 1; `a` is an input string, `d` is a new input string.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to all 0s, `n` is greater than 1, loop variable is 1; `a` is an input string, `d` is a new input string.**
