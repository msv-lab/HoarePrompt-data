The code `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]` indicates that the value at index `i + 1` of the `dp` array is incremented by the value at index `i`. However, the values of the `dp` array are not provided in the initial state, and the specific value of `dp[i]` is unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values after this operation. 

However, we know that `i` is 1, so `dp[i + 1]` refers to `dp[2]` and `dp[i]` refers to `dp[1]`. The operation suggests that the value of `dp[2]` is increased by whatever value is at `dp[1]`. 

Since there is no change in the values of `m` and `i`, and `dp` is modified, the output state reflects the operation performed on `dp`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, `dp[2]` is increased by `dp[1]`**
