The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It processes multiple datasets where each dataset begins with an integer `n`, indicating the number of trains, followed by `n` lines containing departure and arrival times in the format "hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss". The function continues to process datasets until it encounters a dataset where `n` equals 0, which signals the end of input and should not be processed. The output of the function is not specified in the prompt, but it likely involves processing the train times in some manner.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of train departure and arrival times and stops processing when it encounters a dataset with n = 0.**
