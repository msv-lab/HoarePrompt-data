The loop iterates from 0 to 86399 (since `m` is 86400), accumulating values in the `dp` list. After all iterations, `dp[i + 1]` will contain the sum of all previous `dp` values from index 0 to 86399. 

Thus, at the end of the loop, `dp[m]` will represent the cumulative sum of all events stored in the `dp` list, while `m` remains unchanged at 86400. The variable `i` will reach its final value of 86399.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 86399, `dp[m]` is the cumulative sum of all `dp` values from index 0 to 86399.**
