`dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decremented by 1. The value of `dp` at the index `d * 3600 + e * 60 + f` will decrease by 1. The initial state indicates that `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to all 0s. Therefore, after this operation, the specific index in `dp` will hold a value of -1 (assuming `d * 3600 + e * 60 + f` is a valid index). Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `dp` is a list of size 86401 initialized to all 0s; `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decremented by 1**.
