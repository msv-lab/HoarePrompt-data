According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, and `_` is a throwaway variable indicating that the loop does not rely on the value of the variable itself. The loop can execute again as long as the total number of iterations has not yet reached `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 86400, and the loop has executed some number of times already, but we don't have that exact count. However, we know that for the loop to execute one more time, it must be within the total count specified by `n`.

Since `m` does not affect the number of iterations directly but could be used within the loop, we need to focus on the iteration count and `n`. If the loop has executed `k` times so far, the next iteration will be the `k + 1`th execution. 

Assuming the loop has executed `k` times already, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n`. Therefore, after the current iteration, `_` would simply increment by 1.

State: **`m` is 86400, for the loop to execute one more time, it must have executed less than `n` times.**
