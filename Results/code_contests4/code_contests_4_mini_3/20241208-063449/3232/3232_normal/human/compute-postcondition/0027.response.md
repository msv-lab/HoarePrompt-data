The value of `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by `dp[i]`. However, the initial values of `dp` are not specified. Since `i` is 0, `dp[1]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[0]` to it. The output state does not specify the values in the `dp` array, thus we cannot determine the exact result of `dp[i + 1]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `i` is 0, and `dp[1]` is updated by adding `dp[0]` to it, but the values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are unknown. 
Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 0, and `dp[1]` is updated by adding `dp[0]` to it, but the values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are unknown.**
