The statement `a, d = raw_input().split()` assigns values to variables `a` and `d` by taking an input string and splitting it into two parts. The previous state of `m` is unaffected by this operation, and since this code takes input without changing `m`, the output state must reflect the condition of `m`, which remains 86400, and the new variables `a` and `d` are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `a` and `d` are assigned values from input split into two parts.**
