The function processes multiple datasets of train departure and arrival times, calculating the maximum number of trains present at the station at any given time. Each dataset starts with an integer `n` indicating the number of trains, followed by `n` lines of arrival and departure times in the format "hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss". The processing stops when `n` is 0, which indicates the end of input. The function returns the maximum count of overlapping trains for each dataset.
