Precondition: **The input consists of multiple datasets, where each dataset starts with an integer n (1 <= n <= 10,000) representing the number of trains, followed by n lines of departure and arrival times in the format "hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss", with 0 ≤ hh < 24, 0 ≤ mm < 60, and 0 ≤ ss < 60. The last dataset is indicated by n = 0, which should not be processed.**
