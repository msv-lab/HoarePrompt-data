Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly handles the time intervals for counting the number of vehicles. Specifically, the way it updates the `dp` array does not properly account for the fact that a train is considered to be in operation until it arrives at the station. 

For example, if a train departs at `03:00:00` and arrives at `03:00:00`, the program would count this train as both departing and arriving at the exact same second, which means it might incorrectly count the number of trains in operation at that specific second. 

This can lead to situations where the maximum number of vehicles calculated is not representative of the actual requirements. 

Consider the following test case:

```
3
01:00:00 01:00:01
01:00:00 01:00:01
01:00:00 01:00:01
```

In this case, three trains depart and arrive at exactly the same second. The expected output should be `3`, but if the implementation does not accurately track the number of trains at the same time, it might provide an incorrect result.

Thus, the program is not functioning correctly as per the problem description, leading to an output that can be inaccurate for certain edge cases.
