#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters that are either '0' or '1'.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        print(s[::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is at least 1; for each test case, `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; the output consists of every second character of `s` for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` for each test case, and a binary string `s` of length 2n - 1 consisting of '0' and '1'. It prints every second character of the string `s` for each test case. The function does not handle any invalid inputs or edge cases explicitly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers parsed from the input string, which consists of values separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of space-separated values from user input, parses these values into integers, and returns a list of these integers. It does not handle any errors related to incorrect input formats or non-integer values, which could lead to runtime exceptions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by a binary string s of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The length of the list o is between 1 and 1000.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the result of adding 'int(x)' to the corresponding element 'o' from the input split into a list. The final output depends on the values provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `o`, where each tuple contains an integer and a binary string. It reads input from the user, splits it, converts each piece of input into an integer, and attempts to add it to the variable `o`. However, the function does not properly utilize the values from the list of tuples `o`, which may lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the input may not match the expected format. The final output is a list of integers based solely on the user input, not the tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n elements, each obtained from the function func_2()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a binary string `m`, and it returns a list containing `n` elements, where each element is obtained by calling the function `func_2()`. The function does not utilize the parameter `m` in its execution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list obtained by calling func_5 with f and the remaining dimensions from dim for t times, or the result of f() if dim is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable parameter `f` and a sequence of dimensions `dim`. It returns a list that contains the result of calling `func_5` with `f` and the remaining dimensions from `dim` repeated for `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. The functionality implies recursive behavior based on the dimensions provided.
