Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1()` simply prints every second character from the string `s`, which does not guarantee that the constructed binary string `w` will be similar to all required substrings of `s`. 

For example, consider the input case:
```
1
2
101
```
The required substrings to check are:
- s[1..2] = 10
- s[2..3] = 01

The expected output must be a binary string `w` of length 2 that is similar to both `10` and `01`. However, `func_1()` would output `1`, which is incorrect because it does not match the required length (which should be 2).

Moreover, there is no logic in the code to ensure that the chosen characters from `s` (every second character) fulfill the similarity condition with all of the required substrings of length `n`. The annotations indicate that the function only outputs every second character, which does not account for the necessary logic to ensure that the output string meets the problem's similarity requirements.

Thus, the output does not conform to the problem description for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is incorrect.
