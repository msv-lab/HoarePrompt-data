The function accepts a list of tuples `o`, where each tuple contains an integer and a binary string. It reads input from the user, splits it, converts each piece of input into an integer, and attempts to add it to the variable `o`. However, the function does not properly utilize the values from the list of tuples `o`, which may lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the input may not match the expected format. The final output is a list of integers based solely on the user input, not the tuples.
