Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` for each test case, and a binary string `s` of length 2n - 1 consisting of '0' and '1'. It prints every second character of the string `s` for each test case. The function does not handle any invalid inputs or edge cases explicitly. **
