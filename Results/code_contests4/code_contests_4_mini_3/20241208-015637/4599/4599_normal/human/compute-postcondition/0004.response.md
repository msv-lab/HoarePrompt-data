According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of the input integer, which determines how many times the loop runs. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute again, the input integer must be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred.

Since `t` is at least 1, and the loop has executed once, for the loop to execute a second time, `t` must be at least 2. The input integer `n` could be any value greater than or equal to 1 to allow further iterations. As the loop runs, the loop variable `_` is typically used as a placeholder and does not affect the state.

State: **`t` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
