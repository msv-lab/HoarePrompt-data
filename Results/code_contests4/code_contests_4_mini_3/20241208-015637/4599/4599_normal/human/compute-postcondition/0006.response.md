The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. The initial state of `t` and `n` is not affected by this operation, and they retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string**
