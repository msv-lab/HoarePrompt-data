Functionality: ** The function accepts a callable parameter `f` and a sequence of dimensions `dim`. It returns a list that contains the result of calling `func_5` with `f` and the remaining dimensions from `dim` repeated for `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. The functionality implies recursive behavior based on the dimensions provided.**
