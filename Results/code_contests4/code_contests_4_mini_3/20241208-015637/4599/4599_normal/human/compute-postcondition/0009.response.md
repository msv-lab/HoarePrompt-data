The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The variable `t` remains unaffected. Since `t` is at least 1, we can assume the loop will execute at least one more time if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` will hold the input integer value.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer**
