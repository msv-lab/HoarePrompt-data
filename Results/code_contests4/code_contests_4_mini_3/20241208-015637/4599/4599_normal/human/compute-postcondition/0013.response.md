The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, indicating the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 for each test case. `s` is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters that are either '0' or '1'. The function processes these inputs and produces some output based on the given constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` for each test case, and a binary string `s` of length 2n - 1 containing '0' and '1'.**
