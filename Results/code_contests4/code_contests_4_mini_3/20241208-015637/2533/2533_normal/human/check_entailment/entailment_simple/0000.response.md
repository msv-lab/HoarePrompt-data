Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the program only includes a generator function that reads input from `sys.stdin` and yields values, but it lacks the necessary logic to determine the minimum time `t` at which all mice can be caught within the mousetrap.

The problem description requires the program to:
1. Calculate the motion of each mouse based on its initial position and velocity.
2. Determine the earliest time `t` at which all mice are strictly inside the defined rectangle (the mousetrap).
3. Handle cases where it is impossible for all mice to enter the mousetrap, returning `-1` in such cases.

Since the annotated program only processes input without any calculations or logic to solve the problem, it does not meet the requirements. Therefore, it fails to provide a correct output based on the problem specifications.
