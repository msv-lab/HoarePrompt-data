According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the content of the variable `line`. The loop will iterate over the words in the `line` string, which is split into a list. For the loop to execute, `line` must contain at least one word, which it does since it is specified as a non-empty string. 

However, to execute one more time, there must be another non-empty line available in `sys.stdin` to ensure that `line` can be updated and the loop can continue iterating. The value of `value` will correspond to the first word in the new line after the loop begins execution.

Therefore, to summarize the states: `line` must remain a non-empty string, and `value` must be the first word from the next non-empty input line.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, `line` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time there must be another non-empty line in sys.stdin, `value` is the first word from the next non-empty line in sys.stdin.**
