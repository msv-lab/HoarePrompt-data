According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `line` and its words. If `line` has at least two words, the loop will execute again for the next word. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a non-empty string with at least one more word, and the current value yielded is the next word in the split of `line`. This means that for the loop to be executed one more time, `line` must still have at least two words, and the next value yielded will be the subsequent word in the split of `line`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000; for the loop to execute one more time, `line` must have at least two words remaining, and `value` will be the next word in the split of `line.**
