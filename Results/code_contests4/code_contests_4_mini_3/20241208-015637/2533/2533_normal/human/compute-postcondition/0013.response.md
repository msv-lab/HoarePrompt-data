According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `line` variable. The loop iterates through the words obtained from splitting `line`. At the end of the last iteration, `line` has more than one word, and `value` is currently holding the next word from the split line. 

Since the loop processes each word in the `line`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must still be at least one more word left in the `line` after the current `value`. If `value` is the current word being processed, then for the next iteration, `value` should be the next word in the split list of `line`.

We need to determine how many words are in `line` and adjust the state accordingly. If `line` has more than two words, then after yielding the next word, `value` will be the next word in line, and the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `line` has more than two words, `value` is the next word from the split line after the current `value`, and for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more words in `line` to yield.**
