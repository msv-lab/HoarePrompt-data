According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `line` variable. The loop iterates over the values obtained by splitting the string `line`. If the string `line` contains more words, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, since a value has been yielded from the generator function, this indicates that at least one word was processed from the string. 

To execute the loop again, we need to check how many words are in `line`. If it had more words after the last yielded value, the loop will continue. If `line` has at least one more word, the loop can execute again.

Assuming the last yielded value corresponds to the last word processed, we can determine that for the loop to execute a second time, the value should be the next word in the `line` string, and an additional state will reflect that `line` still has words left to process.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, `line` is a non-empty string with at least one more word, and the next value to be yielded from the generator function is the next word in the split of `line`.**
