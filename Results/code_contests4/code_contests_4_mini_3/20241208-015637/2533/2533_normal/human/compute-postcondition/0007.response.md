The loop processes each word in the `line` string by splitting it and yielding each word as a value. If `line` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each word in that string. After all iterations, the output state will reflect that all words have been yielded from the `line`.

If the `line` contains `m` words, after the loop has finished executing, `value` will have been yielded for each of those `m` words. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and `line` will still be the same non-empty string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000; `line` is a non-empty string; `value` has been yielded for each word in the `line` string.**
