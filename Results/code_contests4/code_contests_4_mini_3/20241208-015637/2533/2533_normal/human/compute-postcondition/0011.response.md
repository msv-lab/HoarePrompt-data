According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `line` variable. The `line.split()` method returns a list of words from the string `line`, and the loop iterates over each word in that list. If the `line` contains additional words, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `value` is the first word from the next non-empty line in `sys.stdin`, and `line` has already been split to yield the current `value`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more word in the `line` after the current `value`. If `value` is the last word in the split list, the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, we need to consider that `line` needs to have more words, and `value` should be set to the next word in that split list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, `line` has more than one word, `value` is the next word from the split line, and the loop is ready to execute again.**
