The `yield` statement is used within a generator function to produce a value without terminating the function's execution. The next value to be yielded will be the next word from the `line`, which is a non-empty string with at least one more word. Since `n` is an integer within the specified range and does not affect the yielding process, the output state will reflect that the generator function is yielding the next word from `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000; `line` is a non-empty string with at least one more word; the next value yielded from the generator function is the next word in the split of `line.**
