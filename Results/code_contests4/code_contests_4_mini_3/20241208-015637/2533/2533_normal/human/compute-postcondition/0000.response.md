According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the input coming from `sys.stdin`. For the loop to execute at least once, there must be some input available for reading. The states that need to be satisfied for the loop to execute are that the standard input must not be empty.

Since the variables `n`, `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(rix, riy)`, and `(vix, viy)` do not directly influence the ability to read from `sys.stdin`, we must ensure that the input provides at least one line of data. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we can state:
- There must be at least one line in `sys.stdin` to read from.

Therefore, the adjusted state would reflect that the input is non-empty.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers representing the coordinates of opposite corners of the mousetrap; each mouse's initial position (rix, riy) and speed (vix, viy) are integers; for the loop to execute, there must be at least one line of input available in sys.stdin.**
