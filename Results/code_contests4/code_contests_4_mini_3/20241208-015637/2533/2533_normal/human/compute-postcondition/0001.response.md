According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the availability of input lines from `sys.stdin`. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one line of input available to split into values. The variable `line` must contain a non-empty string, and the split operation must yield at least one value. 

Since `n` is defined as an integer within the range of 1 to 100000, it does not directly influence the execution of the loop, but it indicates that the program is designed to handle multiple elements based on this value. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure:
1. `line` is not empty.
2. The result of `line.split()` produces at least one value.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, `line` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute, line.split() must produce at least one value**
