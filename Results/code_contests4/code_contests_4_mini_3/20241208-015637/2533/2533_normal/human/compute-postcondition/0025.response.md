The function `func_1` does not explicitly define parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the context, it is implied that the function manipulates or utilizes the following inputs:

1. `n`: an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000.
2. `(x1, y1)`: integers representing the coordinates of one corner of the mousetrap.
3. `(x2, y2)`: integers representing the coordinates of the opposite corner of the mousetrap.
4. `(rix, riy)`: integers representing the initial position of a mouse.
5. `(vix, viy)`: integers representing the speed of the mouse.

The output of the function is not specified explicitly in the prompt, so it cannot be determined what the function returns.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters related to the number of mice, coordinates of the mousetrap corners, initial position and speed of each mouse, and processes this information, although the exact return value is not defined.**
