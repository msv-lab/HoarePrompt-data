The function processes input from standard input (stdin) line by line, yielding each word encountered in the lines. It does not return any defined value, but instead, it generates a sequence of words from the input, which can be utilized for further processing. The function does not handle any specific parameters related to mice or a mousetrap, and no actual calculations or logic regarding mice's positions or speeds are implemented.
