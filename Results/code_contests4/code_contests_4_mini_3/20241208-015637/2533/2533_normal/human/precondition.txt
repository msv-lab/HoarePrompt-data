n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers representing the coordinates of the opposite corners of the mousetrap with 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100,000; each mouse's initial position (rix, riy) and speed (vix, viy) are integers where 0 ≤ rix, riy ≤ 100,000 and -100,000 ≤ vix, viy ≤ 100,000.
