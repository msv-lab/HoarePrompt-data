You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Igor the analyst fell asleep on the work and had a strange dream. In the dream his desk was crowded with computer mice, so he bought a mousetrap to catch them.

The desk can be considered as an infinite plane, then the mousetrap is a rectangle which sides are parallel to the axes, and which opposite sides are located in points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

Igor wants to catch all mice. Igor has analysed their behavior and discovered that each mouse is moving along a straight line with constant speed, the speed of the i-th mouse is equal to (vix, viy), that means that the x coordinate of the mouse increases by vix units per second, while the y coordinates increases by viy units. The mousetrap is open initially so that the mice are able to move freely on the desk. Igor can close the mousetrap at any moment catching all the mice that are strictly inside the mousetrap.

Igor works a lot, so he is busy in the dream as well, and he asks you to write a program that by given mousetrap's coordinates, the initial coordinates of the mice and their speeds determines the earliest time moment in which he is able to catch all the mice. Please note that Igor can close the mousetrap only once.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of computer mice on the desk.

The second line contains four integers x1, y1, x2 and y2 (0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100 000), (0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100 000) — the coordinates of the opposite corners of the mousetrap.

The next n lines contain the information about mice.

The i-th of these lines contains four integers rix, riy, vix and viy, (0 ≤ rix, riy ≤ 100 000,  - 100 000 ≤ vix, viy ≤ 100 000), where (rix, riy) is the initial position of the mouse, and (vix, viy) is its speed.

Output

In the only line print minimum possible non-negative number t such that if Igor closes the mousetrap at t seconds from the beginning, then all the mice are strictly inside the mousetrap. If there is no such t, print -1.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 6. 

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if <image>.

Note

Here is a picture of the first sample

Points A, B, C, D - start mice positions, segments are their paths.

Then, at first time when all mice will be in rectangle it will be looks like this:

Points A, D, B will never enter rectangle.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
