Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to generate a test case that produces a specified number of ways to make change using distinct coin denominations. However, it does not handle the case where the number of ways to make change is 1. For example, if `n = 1`, the program does not produce a valid output because it relies on generating multiple denominations, but it can only return a single denomination (like 1 cent) for that case, which does not fit the requirements. 

This leads to an edge case failure:
Input: `1`
Expected Output: `1 1` (with denomination `1`)
Actual Output: The program may not function as intended for this input. 

Since the program does not correctly handle this edge case, it does not fulfill the problem requirements for all potential inputs.
