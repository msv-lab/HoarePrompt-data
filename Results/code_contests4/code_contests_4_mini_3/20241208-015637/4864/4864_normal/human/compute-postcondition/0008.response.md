The code `nom.append(x)` adds the value of `x` (which is 1000000) to the list `nom`. Before execution, `nom` contains the value `[1]`. After the execution of the code, `nom` will contain two elements: `[1, 1000000]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

However, since the length of `nom` (which will now be 2) is not equal to `n` (which is an integer input less than or equal to 10), we do not break out of any loop or if statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, 1000000]; `x` is 1000000, and the length of `nom` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, 1000000]; `x` is 1000000, and the length of `nom` is not equal to `n`.**
