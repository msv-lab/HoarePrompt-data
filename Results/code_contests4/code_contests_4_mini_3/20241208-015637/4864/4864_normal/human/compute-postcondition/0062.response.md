The value of `x` (which is 999997) is appended to the list `nom`. The previous state of `nom` is [1, `res_`, 999999, 999998], which has a length of 4. This means that the length of `nom` is not 10, and since `n` is larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000, the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement based on the length of `nom` being equal to `n % 10 + 2` is also evaluated.

Given that the length of `nom` is 4, we need to evaluate whether `4` equals `n % 10 + 2`. The value of `n % 10` can be from 0 to 9 (since `n` can range from 101 to 1000). Thus, `n % 10 + 2` can range from 2 to 11. 

Since `4` does not equal `n % 10 + 2` for all possible values of `n` in the range specified, the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, we do not break out of the internal loop or if statement, and `nom` now contains an additional item.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`, 999999, 999998, 999997]; `x` is 999997, and we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
