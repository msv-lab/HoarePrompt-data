According to the code, the for loop is set to iterate over the range from 999999 down to 1 (exclusive). The loop will execute as long as the range is valid, which is determined by the starting point and the stopping point of the range. 

Since the starting point is 999999 and the stopping point is 0 (exclusive), the loop will always execute, as long as the range is correctly defined (which it is in this case). 

The current state before the loop starts provides valid values for `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, and `res_`, but these variables do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop does not depend on them.

The loop variable `x` will take values starting from 999999 down to 1. Therefore, at the start of the loop, we can assume that `x` is initialized to 999999.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; `x` is 999999**
