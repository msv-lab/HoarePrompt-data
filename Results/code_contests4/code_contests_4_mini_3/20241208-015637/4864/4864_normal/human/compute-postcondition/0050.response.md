The value of `x` (999999) is appended to the list `nom`, which currently has 2 elements [1, `res_`]. After appending, the length of `nom` becomes 3. Since the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, it remains [1, `res_`, 999999]. The other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`, 999999]; `x` is 999999.**
