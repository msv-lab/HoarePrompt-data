Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; if `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000, then `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list with 10 elements starting with [1, `res_`] followed by the next 8 decremented values from 999999 down to a value that maintains the length of `nom` at 10, and `x` is 999990. Otherwise, if `n` is between 1000 and 10000 (inclusive), then `n` is set to 10000, `change` is set to 10000, `nom` becomes [1, 1], `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and the printed output is "1 9". If `n` is greater than 10000 and less than or equal to 100000, then `n` is set to 100000, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999992, and `change` remains 1000000 with `nom` being a list containing 1 element.***
