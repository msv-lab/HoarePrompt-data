The loop continues until either the length of `nom` reaches 10 or the length of `nom` equals `n % 10 + 2`. Given that the initial length of `nom` is 2 and `n` is 100000, we have `n % 10` equal to 0, so `n % 10 + 2` equals 2. This means that the loop will keep appending values to `nom` until its length is 10 since it will not meet the second break condition. 

In each iteration, one element is appended to `nom`, starting from `999999` and decreasing by 1 each time. The loop will run until `nom` has 10 elements. Therefore, it will execute 8 times to reach a length of 10 (since it starts with 2 and needs to reach 10).

After all iterations, `nom` will contain 10 elements, specifically from `999999` down to `999992`. 

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 10 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999992.**
