To determine the output state, we first analyze the code snippet provided. 

The variable `res` is defined as `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `res` will always be a positive integer. The calculation of `res_` involves integer division of `change` by `res`.

1. The variable `change` is given as 1000000.
2. The variable `res` is evaluated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, which is a positive integer that can range from 9 (if n is 10) to 99 (if n is 100). 

Using the possible values of `n`, we can derive the possible values of `res`:
- If `n = 10`, then `res = 10 - 10 % 10 - 1 = 9`.
- If `n = 100`, then `res = 100 - 100 % 10 - 1 = 99`.

Thus, `res` can take any integer value from 9 to 99 depending on the specific value of `n`.

Now, we calculate `res_`:
- If `res` is 9, then `res_ = 1000000 // 9 = 111111`.
- If `res` is 99, then `res_ = 1000000 // 99 = 10101`.

Since `res_` will depend on the value of `res`, we conclude that `res_` can take values between 10101 and 111111.

The output state reflects the range of possible values for `res` and `res_` based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111.**
