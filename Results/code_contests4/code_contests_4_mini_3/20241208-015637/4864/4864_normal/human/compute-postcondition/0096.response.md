The loop iterates as long as the length of `nom` is not equal to 10 and not equal to `n % 10 + 2`. Given that `n` is 10000, `n % 10` is 0, so `n % 10 + 2` equals 2. This means that the loop will terminate when `nom` reaches a length of 10 or when it reaches a length of 2.

1. Initially, `nom` has a length of 2. Therefore, the loop condition to append to `nom` is not satisfied, and the loop will not execute at all.

Given that the loop does not execute, all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9".**
