The code appends the value of `x` to the list `nom`. The value of `x` is not provided, so we cannot determine what it specifically is. The length of `nom` is currently 3, which does not meet either condition for breaking out of the loop. Thus, the previous states of the variables do not change as a result of this action, but `nom` will now include the new value.

The output state reflects the current status of the variables, noting that the length of `nom` is not affected by the conditions.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, x]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9".**
