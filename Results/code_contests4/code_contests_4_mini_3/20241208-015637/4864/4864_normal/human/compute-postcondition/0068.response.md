The code snippet provided is a print statement that concatenates the string representations of `change` and the integer `2`, separated by a space. The variable `change` has the value `10000`. The other variables (`A`, `n`, and `nom`) are not affected by this operation.

The output of the print statement will be the string `"10000 2"`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and not less than or equal to 1000, and it satisfies n = 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; printed output is "10000 2".**
