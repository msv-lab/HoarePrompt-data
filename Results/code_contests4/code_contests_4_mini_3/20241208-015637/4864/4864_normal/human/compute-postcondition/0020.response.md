To evaluate the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the expression being executed.

Initial State: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1].

The code `res = n - n % 10 - 1` calculates the value of `res` based on the value of `n`. 

1. Since `n` is between 11 and 100, it can be any integer in that range.
2. The expression `n % 10` computes the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, which gives the last digit of `n`.
3. The expression `n - n % 10` effectively rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10.
4. Finally, subtracting `1` from this result gives the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n`.

Therefore, the value of `res` will depend on the specific value of `n` chosen within its range.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`**.
