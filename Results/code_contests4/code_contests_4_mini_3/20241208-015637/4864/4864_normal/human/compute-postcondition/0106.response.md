`res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`. The value of `change` is 1000000 and the value of `res` is 99999. Therefore, `res_` is calculated as 1000000 // 99999, which equals 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1], `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10**
