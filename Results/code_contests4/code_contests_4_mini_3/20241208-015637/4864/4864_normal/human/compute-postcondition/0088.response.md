Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1, 999999]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9". If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no action is taken in the else part.***
