`nom` is a list containing 12 elements, and the length of `nom` is currently not equal to 10. However, since the length of `nom` is 12, we first check if it is equal to `n % 10 + 2`. 

Calculating `n % 10 + 2`: 
- `n` is 100000, so `n % 10` is 0.
- Therefore, `n % 10 + 2` equals 2.

Since the length of `nom` is 12, it is not equal to 2, and the program does not break out of the most internal loop based on this condition either.

Next, the code `nom.append(x)` appends the value of `x` (which is 999997) to the `nom` list. After this operation, the length of `nom` becomes 13. 

The output state reflects the updated length of `nom` and the addition of the value of `x`. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 13 elements (previously 12), `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999997.**
