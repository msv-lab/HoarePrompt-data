The code `nom.append(x)` appends the value of `x`, which is 999998, to the list `nom`. The initial state indicates that `nom` is currently `[1, res_, 999999]`. The length of `nom` is 3, which does not equal 10, and since `n` is larger than 100 and satisfies the condition `100 < n ≤ 1000`, `n % 10` will yield a value in the range of 0 to 9. Therefore, `n % 10 + 2` will yield a value in the range of 2 to 11. 

With the length of `nom` being 3, it does not equal `n % 10 + 2` (which is at least 2), so no break statement is triggered. 

After appending, the updated `nom` list becomes `[1, res_, 999999, 999998]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`, 999999, 999998]; `x` is 999998.**
