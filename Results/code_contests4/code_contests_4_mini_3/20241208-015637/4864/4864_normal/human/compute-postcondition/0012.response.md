The code `nom.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `nom`. Initially, `nom` is [1, 1000000] and `x` is 999999. After executing this line, `nom` will contain three elements: 1, 1000000, and 999999. The length of `nom` will then be 3, which is less than or equal to `n` (since `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10). 

The output state reflects the updated state of the variables after this operation:

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, 1000000, 999999]; `x` is 999999; the length of `nom` is equal to 3, which is less than or equal to `n`.**
