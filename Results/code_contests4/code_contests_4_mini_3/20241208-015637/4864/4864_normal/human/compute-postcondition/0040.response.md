To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the variables involved in the code snippet provided.

Initial State:
- `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5
- `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000
- `change` is 1000000
- `nom` is [1]
- `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`

Now, we will compute `res`:

Since `n` is larger than 100 and at most 1000, `n` can take various values. The expression `n - n % 10 - 1` calculates:
- `n % 10` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 10.
- Thus, `n - n % 10` rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10.
- Subtracting 1 from that result gives us a value that is one less than that multiple of 10.

Now we can compute `res_`:
```
res_ = change // res
```
Given that `change` is 1000000, the value of `res_` will depend on the computed value of `res`, which is dependent on `n`.

Since `n` can range from just above 100 to 1000, let's examine how `res` behaves:
- For `n = 101`: `res = 101 - 101 % 10 - 1 = 101 - 1 - 1 = 99`
- For `n = 999`: `res = 999 - 999 % 10 - 1 = 999 - 9 - 1 = 989`

Therefore, `res` can take values from 99 to 989, leading to the calculation of `res_`:
- When `res = 99`, `res_ = 1000000 // 99 ≈ 10101`
- When `res = 989`, `res_ = 1000000 // 989 ≈ 1011`

Thus, `res_` is an integer that will vary between approximately 1011 and 10101 based on the choice of `n`.

Since we don't have a specific value for `n`, we will generalize the output state.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is an integer from approximately 1011 to 10101 based on the value of `n`.**
