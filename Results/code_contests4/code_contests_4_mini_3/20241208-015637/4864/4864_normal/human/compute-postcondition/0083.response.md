Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1, 999999]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9"; if the length of `nom` is equal to 10, then the loop executes for the first time with `x` being 999999 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` is not equal to 10 and it equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
