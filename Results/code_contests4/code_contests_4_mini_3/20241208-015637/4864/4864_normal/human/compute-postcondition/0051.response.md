According to the code, the for loop iterates over a range starting from 999999 down to 1 (the loop will not include 0). The loop variable `x` is initialized to 999999, and in each iteration, it decrements by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be decremented by 1, making it 999998. The loop will execute again as long as `x` is greater than 0.

Given these adjustments:
- `A` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `change` remains unchanged.
- `nom` remains unchanged.
- The new value of `x` will be 999998.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`, 999999]; `x` is 999998.**
