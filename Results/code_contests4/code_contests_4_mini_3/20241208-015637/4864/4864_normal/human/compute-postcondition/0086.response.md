The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1, 999999]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9"; for the loop to execute a second time, `x` must be 999998 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
