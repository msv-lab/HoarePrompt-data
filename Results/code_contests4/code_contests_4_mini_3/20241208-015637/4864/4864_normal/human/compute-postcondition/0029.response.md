The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 10 elements [1, res_, 999999]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be 999999 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
