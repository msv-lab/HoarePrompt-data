According to the code, the loop is set to iterate from 999999 down to 1. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, and `res_`, as these variables do not affect the range or execution of the loop directly. 

However, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the initial state of the loop variable `x`. Since `x` will start at 999999 during the first iteration, we do not need to adjust this.

Therefore, the states that need to be acknowledged are primarily related to the loop variable `x`, which will begin at 999999 and count downwards. 

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9"; for the loop to execute the first time `x` is 999999**
