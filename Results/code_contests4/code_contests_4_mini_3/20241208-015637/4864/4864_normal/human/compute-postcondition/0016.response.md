The code `nom.append(x)` adds the value of `x`, which is 999998, to the list `nom`. The initial list `nom` is [1, 1000000, 999999]. After appending, `nom` will become [1, 1000000, 999999, 999998]. Since the length of `nom` is now 4, which exceeds `n` (maximum value of 10), the condition for breaking out of the loop (if applicable) would be satisfied. However, the output state primarily reflects the change to the `nom` list. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1, 1000000, 999999, 999998], `x` is 999998, and the length of `nom` is now 4.**
