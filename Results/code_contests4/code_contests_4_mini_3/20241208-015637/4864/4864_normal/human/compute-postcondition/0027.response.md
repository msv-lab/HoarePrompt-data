The value of `x` is appended to the list `nom`. Since `nom` initially contains 10 elements, appending `x` will increase its length to 11. This will trigger the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 10 elements [1, res_, 999999]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 10 elements [1, res_, 999999]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
