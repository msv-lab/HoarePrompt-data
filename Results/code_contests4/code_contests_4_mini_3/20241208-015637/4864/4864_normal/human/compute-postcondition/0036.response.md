After analyzing the provided initial state and the loop code, we can deduce the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

The loop will continue to append values to the `nom` list until its length reaches 10. The starting length of `nom` is 2 (with elements [1, res_]). Therefore, the loop will need to append 8 more elements to `nom` before reaching a length of 10.

The values appended to `nom` will be numbers starting from 999999 and decrementing by 1 with each iteration (999999, 999998, ..., until the length of `nom` is 10).

After the loop completes, the `nom` list will contain exactly 10 elements, and the last 8 elements will be the decremented values from 999999 to 999992.

Thus, the final output state incorporates these values while preserving the other initial states.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 10 elements [1, res_, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111.**
