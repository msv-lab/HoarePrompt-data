The code executes a print statement that concatenates the string representation of the numbers 1 and 9, separated by a space. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables such as `change`, `n`, `A`, or `nom`. Therefore, the output will simply be the string produced by the print statement while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`change` is 100000, `n` is 100000, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `nom` is [1], and the output of the print statement is '1 9'.**
