`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`. The value of `n` is larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000, meaning `n` can take any integer value in this range. The operation `n % 10` gives us the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, which is a number between 0 and 9. Therefore, `n - n % 10` effectively rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. Subtracting 1 from this result means `res` will be one less than that multiple of 10. 

Thus, the value of `res` will depend on the specific value of `n`, but it will always be one less than the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. 

For example:
- If `n` is 101, then `res` = 101 - 1 = 100
- If `n` is 110, then `res` = 110 - 0 - 1 = 109
- If `n` is 999, then `res` = 999 - 9 - 1 = 989

Since we do not know the specific value of `n`, we can say that `res` is computed based on the formula. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`**
