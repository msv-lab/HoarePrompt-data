Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; if `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100, then `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 10 elements [1, `res_`, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992], where `res` is an integer between 9 and 99 and `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111. Otherwise, if `n` is larger than 100 and less than or equal to 1000, then `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list starting with [1, `res_`] followed by the next 8 decremented values from 999999 down to a value that maintains the length of `nom` at 10, and `x` is 999990. If `n` is between 1000 and 10000 (inclusive), then `n` is set to 10000, `change` is set to 10000, `nom` becomes [1, 1], `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and the printed output is "1 9". If `n` is greater than 10000 and less than or equal to 100000, then `n` is set to 100000, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999992, and `change` remains 1000000 with `nom` being a list containing 1 element.***
