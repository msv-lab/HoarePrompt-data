The variable `change` is assigned the value of 100000. The previous value of `change` was 1000000. The other variables `A`, `n`, and `nom` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer equal to 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; `n` is larger than 100 and not less than or equal to 1000, and `n` is not in the range (1000, 10000], and 10000 < `n` ≤ 100000.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer equal to 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; `n` is larger than 100 and not less than or equal to 1000, and `n` is not in the range (1000, 10000], and 10000 < `n` ≤ 100000.**
