The code appends the value of `x` (which is 999998) to the list `nom`. The initial state indicates that `nom` contains 11 elements, and since 11 is not less than 10, the first condition for breaking out of the loop is not met. However, the second condition checks if the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`. Since `n` is 100000, `n % 10` equals 0, making `n % 10 + 2` equal to 2. The length of `nom` is currently 11, which is not equal to 2, so the second condition also does not hold. Therefore, the length of `nom` will now be 12 after appending `x`.

The output state is that `nom` is now a list with 12 elements, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 12 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999998**.
