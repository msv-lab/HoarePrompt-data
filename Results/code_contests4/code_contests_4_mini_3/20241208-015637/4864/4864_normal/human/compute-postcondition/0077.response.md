The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9"; the length of `nom` is equal to 10; for the loop to execute the first time `x` is 999999 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
