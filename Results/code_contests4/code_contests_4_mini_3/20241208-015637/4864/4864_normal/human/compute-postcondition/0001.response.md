The variable `change` is assigned the value `1000000`. The values of the other variables `A` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer; `change` is 1000000.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer; `change` is 1000000**
