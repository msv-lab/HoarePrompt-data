Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list of 10 integers [1, `res_`] where `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1` and `res_` is an integer from approximately 1011 to 10101 based on the value of `n`; `x` is 999999, and if the length of `nom` is 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, it remains [1, `res_`] and if the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
