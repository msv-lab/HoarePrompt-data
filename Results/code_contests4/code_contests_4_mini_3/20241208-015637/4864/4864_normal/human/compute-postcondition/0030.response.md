Postcondition: ***If `nom` is a list containing 10 elements, then `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` contains the elements [1, res_, 999999]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; and for the loop to execute a second time, `x` must be 999999, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program does nothing since there is no else part.***
