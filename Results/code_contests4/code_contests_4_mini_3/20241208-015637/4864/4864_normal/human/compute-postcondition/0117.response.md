According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop starts with `x` initialized to `1000000 - 1` and decrements by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be decremented to 999998. 

The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be 999998, which is still greater than 0.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 11 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999998, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be greater than 0**
