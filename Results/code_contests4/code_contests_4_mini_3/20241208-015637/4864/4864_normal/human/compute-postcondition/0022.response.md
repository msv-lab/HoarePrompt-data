The value of `res_` is appended to the list `nom`. The previous value of `nom` is [1], and `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111. After executing the code, `nom` will contain two elements: the original element (1) and the new element (`res_`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111.**
