The code executes a print statement that concatenates two string representations of integers. The value `1` is converted to a string and concatenated with a space and the string representation of `9`. This results in the output "1 9", which is printed to the console. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and not less than or equal to 1000, and it satisfies n = 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; printed output is "1 9".**
