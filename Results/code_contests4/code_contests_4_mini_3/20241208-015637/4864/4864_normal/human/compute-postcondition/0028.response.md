According to the code, the loop is structured to iterate starting from 999999 down to 1. The loop's control variable `x` will decrease by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must be 1 for the loop to execute again. Since the loop continues as long as `x` is greater than 0, to execute the loop one more time, `x` must be set to 999999 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 10 elements [1, res_, 999999]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be 999999.**
