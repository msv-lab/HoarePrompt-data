The `nom` list is being modified by appending the value of `x`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `x`, we cannot determine the exact content of `nom` after the operation. However, we can note that `nom` will now have one additional element, which is `x`.

The original length of `nom` is 4, which does not trigger the break condition based on the length being equal to `n % 10 + 2` (which evaluates to 2). Therefore, the break conditions are not met.

The output state reflects the updated `nom` list and the unchanged status of the other variables.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, x]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9"; `nom` now has length 5 and contains an additional element `x`.**
