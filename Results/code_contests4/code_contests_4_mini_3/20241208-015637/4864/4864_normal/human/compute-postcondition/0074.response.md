`nom` is modified by appending the value of `res_`, which is 1. After executing the code, the state of `nom` changes from `[1]` to `[1, 1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; and the printed output is "1 9".

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; and the printed output is "1 9".**
