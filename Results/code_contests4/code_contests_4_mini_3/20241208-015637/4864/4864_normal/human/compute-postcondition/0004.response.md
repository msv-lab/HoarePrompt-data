According to the code, the for loop is set to iterate over the range from 1000000 down to 1 (inclusive of 1). The variable `x` will take on each of these values sequentially. The loop will execute as long as the range is valid, which it is in this case.

The provided states are `A` (which has a range of 1 to 100,000), `n` (which is less than or equal to 10), `change` (which is 1000000), and `nom` (which is a list containing 1). The loop itself does not depend on the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, or `nom` for its execution. 

Hence, no adjustments to these states are necessary for the loop to execute. The loop will successfully start and execute because the range is valid.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1; for the loop to execute, x will start at 1000000**
