According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over a range from 999999 down to 1. The loop variable `x` starts at 999999 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` would have been 999999, and it would decrease to 999998 for the next iteration.

Since the loop continues while `x` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be adjusted to 999998.

The other variables (`A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, `res_`, and the printed output) do not affect the loop's execution condition but remain unchanged.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, x]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; printed output is "1 9", for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be 999998.**
