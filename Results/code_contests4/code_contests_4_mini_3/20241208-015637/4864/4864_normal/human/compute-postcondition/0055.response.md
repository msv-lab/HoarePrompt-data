Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`, 999999]; `x` is 999998. If the length of `nom` equals 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` equals `n % 10 + 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
