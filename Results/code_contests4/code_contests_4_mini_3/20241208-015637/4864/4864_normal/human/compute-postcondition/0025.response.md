The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 10 elements [1, res_]; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; `x` is 999999; and the length of `nom` is 10, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
