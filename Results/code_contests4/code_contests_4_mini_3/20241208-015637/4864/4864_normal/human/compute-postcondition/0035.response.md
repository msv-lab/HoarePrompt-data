The `nom` list is modified by appending the value of `x`, which is 999998. The previous state of `nom` contains 11 elements, and after appending `x`, it will have 12 elements. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nom` contains 12 elements including [1, res_, 999999, 999999, 999998]; `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; `x` is 999998 and since the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`nom` contains 12 elements including [1, res_, 999999, 999999, 999998]; `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111; `x` is 999998 and since the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
