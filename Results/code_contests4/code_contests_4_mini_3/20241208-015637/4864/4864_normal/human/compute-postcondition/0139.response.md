Functionality: ** The function reads an integer input `n` from standard input and generates a list `nom` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is between 1 and 10, it adds numbers from 1 to `1000001 - n` to `nom`. If `n` is between 11 and 100, it computes a value `res_` based on `n` and adds it along with values from `999999` down to ensure `nom` has 10 elements. For `n` between 101 and 1000, it behaves similarly, ensuring the length of `nom` remains 10. If `n` is between 1001 and 10000, it prints "1 9" and terminates. If `n` is 10000 or 100000, it prints "10000 2" or "100000 2" respectively and also prints "1 9" before terminating. The output includes the value of `change` and the length of `nom`, followed by the elements of `nom`. The function does not return anything but prints results to standard output. **
