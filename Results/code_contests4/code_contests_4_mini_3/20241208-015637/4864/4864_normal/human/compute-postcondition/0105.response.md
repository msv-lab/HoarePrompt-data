The value of `res` is assigned the expression `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is 100000, we first calculate `n % 10`, which is 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `100000 - 0 - 1`, resulting in `res` being assigned the value 99999. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1], and `res` is 99999.**
