The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 11 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999998 and we break out of the most internal loop.
