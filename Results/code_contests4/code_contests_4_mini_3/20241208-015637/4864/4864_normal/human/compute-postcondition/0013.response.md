According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1000000 down to 1. The loop variable `x` starts at 1000000 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999999.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be decremented to 999998. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, 1000000, 999999]; `x` is 999998; the length of `nom` is equal to 3, which is less than or equal to `n`.**
