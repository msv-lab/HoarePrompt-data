The code prints the string representation of the variable `change` followed by the string representation of the integer `2`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. The value of `change` is 100000.

Therefore, the output state is: `change` is 100000, `n` is 100000, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `nom` is [1].

Output State: **`change` is 100000, `n` is 100000, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `nom` is [1], and the output of the print statement is '100000 2'.**
