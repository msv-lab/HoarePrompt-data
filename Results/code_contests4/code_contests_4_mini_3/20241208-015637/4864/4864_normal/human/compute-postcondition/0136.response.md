The code takes the variable `nom`, which is a list containing 1 element, and maps each element of the list to a string using `map(str, nom)`. Then it joins these string representations with a space using `' '.join(...)`. Since `nom` contains only 1 element, the output will reflect that single element as a string, followed by a space (though the space won't affect the output since there's no second element).

Given the information provided, the printed output is "1000000 1", meaning that the list `nom` contains the value `1000000` as the single element.

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1 element with value 1000000; `x` is 1; and the printed output is "1000000 1".
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1 element with value 1000000; `x` is 1; and the printed output is "1000000 1".**
