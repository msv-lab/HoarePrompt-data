The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, 1000000, 999999]; `x` is 999998; the length of `nom` is equal to 3, which is less than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
