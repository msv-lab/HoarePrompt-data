The code `exit(0)` is executed, which terminates the program immediately. The variables `A`, `n`, `change`, and `nom` retain their previous values, and there is no change to their states. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and not less than or equal to 1000, and it satisfies n = 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; printed output is "1 9".**
