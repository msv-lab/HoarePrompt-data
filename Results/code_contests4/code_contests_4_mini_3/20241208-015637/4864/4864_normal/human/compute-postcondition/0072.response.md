The variable `res` is assigned the value of the expression `n - n % 10 - 1`. The value of `n` is 10000, so we calculate `n % 10`, which is 0 (since 10000 is divisible by 10). Thus, the expression simplifies to `10000 - 0 - 1`, resulting in `res` being assigned the value 9999. The states of the other variables (`A`, `change`, `nom`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is 9999; and the printed output is "1 9".

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is 9999; and the printed output is "1 9".**
