According to the code, the loop executes while `x` takes on values starting from 999999 and decreasing until it reaches 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999998. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be decremented by 1, which will make `x` equal to 999997. 

Since the loop's condition is based solely on the value of `x`, and there are no other dependencies or conditions mentioned regarding `n`, `A`, `change`, or `nom`, we can conclude that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, the state will be adjusted as follows:

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`, 999999, 999998]; `x` is 999997.**
