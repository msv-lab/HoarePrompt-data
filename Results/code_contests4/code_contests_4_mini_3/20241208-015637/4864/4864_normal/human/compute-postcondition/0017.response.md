The loop continues to append values to the list `nom` until the length of `nom` reaches `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer less than or equal to 10, the loop will execute until `nom` contains `n` elements. The initial element in `nom` is `1`, and the subsequent elements appended will be the values starting from `1000000` down to `1000001 - n`. 

After the loop completes all iterations:

- `nom` will contain `n` elements: `[1, 1000000, 999999, ..., 1000001 - n]`.
- The last value appended will be `1000001 - n`, which corresponds to the value of `x` during the last iteration.
- The length of `nom` will equal `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing `n` elements starting from `1` to `1000001 - n`; `x` is `1000001 - n`; the length of `nom` is equal to `n`.**
