Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; if `n` is between 1000 and 10000 (inclusive), then `n` is set to 10000, `change` is set to 10000, `nom` becomes [1, 1], `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and the printed output is "1 9". Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 10000 and less than or equal to 100000, then `n` is set to 100000, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, and `x` is 999992; meanwhile, `change` remains 1000000 and `nom` is a list containing 1 element.***
