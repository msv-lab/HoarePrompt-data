The code `nom.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the list `nom`. Given the initial state, we know that `nom` already contains 10 elements, including the value `999999`. Since `x` is `999999`, this value will be appended to the list. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nom` contains 10 elements including [1, res_, 999999] and `x` is 999999, now `nom` will have 11 elements with the last being 999999 again.

Output State: **`nom` contains 11 elements including [1, res_, 999999, 999999], `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `res` is an integer between 9 and 99; `res_` is an integer between 10101 and 111111.**
