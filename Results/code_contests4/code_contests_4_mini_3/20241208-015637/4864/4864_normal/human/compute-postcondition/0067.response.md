The value of `change` is assigned the value `10000`, which overrides its previous value of `1000000`. The other variables `A`, `n`, and `nom` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and not less than or equal to 1000, and it satisfies n = 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1].

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and not less than or equal to 1000, and it satisfies n = 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]**
