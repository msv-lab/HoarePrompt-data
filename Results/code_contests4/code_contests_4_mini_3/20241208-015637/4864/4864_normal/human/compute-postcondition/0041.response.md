The code `nom.append(res_)` appends the value of `res_` to the list `nom`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `nom` is [1], and `res_` is an integer from approximately 1011 to 10101 based on the value of `n`. After execution, `nom` will contain an additional value, which is `res_`. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is an integer from approximately 1011 to 10101 based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is an integer from approximately 1011 to 10101 based on the value of `n`.**
