Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and satisfies 100 < `n` ≤ 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, `res_`, 999999, 999998]; `x` is 999997. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
