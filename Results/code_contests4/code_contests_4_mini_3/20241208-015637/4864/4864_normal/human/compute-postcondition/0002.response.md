`nom` is assigned a list containing a single element, which is the integer 1. The previous values of `A`, `n`, and `change` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]**
