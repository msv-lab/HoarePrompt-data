Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 11 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999998. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, we also break out of the most internal loop.***
