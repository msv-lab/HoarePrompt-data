According to the code, the loop executes while `x` is decremented from `1000000 - 1` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `999998`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be decremented by `1`, resulting in `x` being `999997`. 

Since the loop continues as long as `x` is greater than `0`, the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied because `999997` is still greater than `0`.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 12 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999997 for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be greater than 0.**
