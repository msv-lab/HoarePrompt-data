The variable `res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`. Here, `change` is 10000 and `res` is 9999. Therefore, `res_` is calculated as 10000 // 9999, which equals 1 (as integer division is being used). The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1; and the printed output is "1 9".**
