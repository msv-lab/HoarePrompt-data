Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer input less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1, 1000000, 999999], `x` is 999998, and the length of `nom` is equal to 3, which is less than or equal to `n`. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
