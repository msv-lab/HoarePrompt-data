The execution of `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program exits, indicating a successful termination. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1 element with value 1000000; `x` is 1; and the printed output is "1000000 1", and the program exits.
