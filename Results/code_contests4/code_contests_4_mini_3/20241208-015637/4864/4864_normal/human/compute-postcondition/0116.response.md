The command `nom.append(x)` adds the value of `x`, which is 999999, to the list `nom`. The initial state mentions that if the length of `nom` equals 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since `nom` is currently a list containing 10 elements, appending `x` will increase its length to 11. Therefore, the length condition will no longer be satisfied, and we will not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 11 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999999, and we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 11 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999999, and we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
