`nom` is a list that initially contains the value `[1]`. The code `nom.append(res_)` appends the value of `res_` (which is 10) to the list `nom`. After execution, `nom` will contain the values `[1, 10]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1, 10], `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1, 10], `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10**
