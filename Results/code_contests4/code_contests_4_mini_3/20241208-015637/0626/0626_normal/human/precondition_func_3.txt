n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and a is a list of n integers where each integer ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) represents the number of apples in the leaf vertices of the tree. The tree is defined by n-1 edges connecting the vertices, where each edge connects two distinct vertices indexed from 1 to n.
