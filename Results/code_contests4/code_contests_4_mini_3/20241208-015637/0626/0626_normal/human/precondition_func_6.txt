a is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of apples in the leaf vertices of a rooted tree, and b is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the edges connecting the vertices in the tree. The number of vertices in the tree is n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer in the list a satisfies 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8.
