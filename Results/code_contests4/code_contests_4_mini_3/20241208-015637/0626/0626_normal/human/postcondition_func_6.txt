The function accepts a list of integers `a` representing the number of apples in leaf vertices of a rooted tree and a list of tuples `b` representing the edges connecting the vertices in the tree. It divides the list of integers `a` by the result of the function `func_6(a, b)` and then multiplies this result by the list of tuples `b`. However, it is important to note that if `func_6(a, b)` returns 0, this will lead to a division by zero error. Additionally, the overall operation involving lists `a` and `b` may not be correctly defined for element-wise operations as indicated. Therefore, the function may not behave as intended if the assumptions about the mathematical operations on lists are incorrect.
