The function accepts a tuple `o` containing an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list of `n` integers representing the number of apples in the leaf vertices (where each value is between 0 and 10^8), and a list of `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree. The current implementation only prints the input tuple and does not process or return any value based on the structure of the tree or the apples in the leaf vertices. Therefore, it lacks any functionality beyond this print statement.
