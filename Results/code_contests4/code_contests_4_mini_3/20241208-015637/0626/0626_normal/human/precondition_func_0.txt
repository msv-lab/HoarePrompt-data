n is an integer between 2 and 100,000 (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the number of vertices in the tree; and there is a list of n integers where each integer (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) represents the number of apples at the leaf vertices, with non-leaf vertices guaranteed to have zero apples. Additionally, there are n - 1 edges described by pairs of integers, each representing a connection between two vertices (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi).
