n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and there is a list of n integers where each integer ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) represents the number of apples in the leaf vertices, with non-leaf vertices guaranteed to have zero apples. The tree is described by n - 1 edges connecting pairs of vertices, where each edge consists of two distinct integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n).
