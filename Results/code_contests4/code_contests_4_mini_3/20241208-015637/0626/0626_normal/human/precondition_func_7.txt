node is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, parent is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current node. The tree has n vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), with leaf vertices containing non-negative integers (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) representing the number of apples, and non-leaf vertices having zero apples.
