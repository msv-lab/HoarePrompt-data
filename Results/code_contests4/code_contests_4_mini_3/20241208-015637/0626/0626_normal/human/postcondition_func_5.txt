The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a list of tuples `b`. However, the code incorrectly uses the variables `a` and `b`, leading to unexpected behavior. The intended functionality seems to involve a loop that modifies `a` and `b` using the modulo operation, but this will not yield a meaningful result based on the provided annotations. Ultimately, the function attempts to return the list stored in `a`, which is a list of integers, not tuples as stated in the annotations. Therefore, the function does not perform as described in the annotations and instead returns the modified `a`. Additionally, there are no checks for the input parameters, and if `b` is not initialized correctly, it may lead to an infinite loop or an error.
