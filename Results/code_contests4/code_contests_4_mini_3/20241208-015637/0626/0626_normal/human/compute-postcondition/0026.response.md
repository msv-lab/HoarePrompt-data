Output State: **`node` is a tree with at least one child in `node[2]`, `lcm` is the least common multiple of the values returned by `func_7(lcm, child[0])` for all children in `node[2]`, `func_9(child)` has been executed for all children in `node[2]`, `child` is the third child in `node[2]`, `t` is now equal to `child[1]`, `max` is now equal to `t`, and `t` is now equal to `child[1] / lcm * lcm`; therefore, `max` is updated to the value of `t`.**
