Postcondition: ***`node` is a tree with at least one child in `node[2]`, `lcm` is the least common multiple of the values returned by `func_7(lcm, child[0])` for all children in `node[2]`, `func_9(child)` has been executed for all children in `node[2]`, `child` is the second child in `node[2]`, `t` is equal to `child[1]`, `max` is now equal to `t` if it was less than 0 or greater than `t`, and `t` is now equal to `child[1] / lcm * lcm`. If `max` is less than 0 or greater than `t`, then `max` is assigned the value of `t`.***
