Output State: **`node[0]` is assigned the value of `lcm`, which is the least common multiple of the values returned by `func_7(lcm, child[0])` for all children in `node[2]`, `lcm` remains unchanged, `child` is the last child in `node[2]`, `t` is equal to the value of the last child's second element, and `max` is the maximum value of `t` encountered during the iterations.**
