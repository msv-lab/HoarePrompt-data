Output State: **`node` is a tree with at least one child in `node[2]`, `lcm` is the least common multiple of the values returned by `func_7(lcm, child[0])` for all children in `node[2]`, `func_9(child)` has been executed for all children in `node[2]`, `child` is the last child in `node[2]`, `t` is equal to the value of the last child's second element, and `max` is the maximum value of `t` encountered during the iterations, which is either equal to the last `t` or the maximum of all previous `t` values if `max` was updated during the loop executions.`**
