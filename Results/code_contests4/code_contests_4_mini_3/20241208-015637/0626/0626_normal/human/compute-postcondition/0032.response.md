Functionality: ** The function accepts a tree structure `node` representing a rooted tree with `n` vertices, where each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer (the number of apples) and non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. If `node[1]` is less than zero, the function calculates the least common multiple of the values from its children nodes and updates `node[0]` to this LCM. It also calculates the maximum adjusted value based on the number of apples in the children nodes, updates `node[1]` accordingly, and returns the modified tree structure. If `node[1]` is greater than or equal to zero, the function returns without making any changes. **
