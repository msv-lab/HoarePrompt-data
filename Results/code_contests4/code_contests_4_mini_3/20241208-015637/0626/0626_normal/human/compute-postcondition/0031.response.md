The function `func_9` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` is a tree represented as a rooted structure with `n` vertices, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). Each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer representing the number of apples, with the constraint that \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^8\) for leaf vertices, and non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. The function returns the tree structure `node` with these specified properties, ensuring that the value of `node[1]` is greater than or equal to 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tree structure `node` with `n` vertices, where leaf vertices contain non-negative integers representing the number of apples, and non-leaf vertices have a value of zero, and returns this tree structure.**
