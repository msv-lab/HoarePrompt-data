According to the code, the loop iterates over the children in `node[2]`. Since the state indicates that `node` is a tree with at least one child in `node[2]`, the loop can execute given that there is at least one child to iterate over. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `child` will be assigned the first child in `node[2]`. Since `func_9(child)` has been executed for all children in `node[2]`, this implies that each child is prepared for processing in the loop body.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that:
- `child` is the first child in `node[2]`.

State: **`node` is a tree with at least one child in `node[2]`, `lcm` is the least common multiple of the values returned by `func_7(lcm, child[0])` for all children in `node[2]`, `func_9(child)` has been executed for all children in `node[2]`, `child` is the first child in `node[2]`**.
