Postcondition: ***`node` is a tree with at least one child in `node[2]`, `lcm` is the least common multiple of the values returned by `func_7(lcm, child[0])` for all children in `node[2]`, `func_9(child)` has been executed for all children in `node[2]`, `child` is the third child in `node[2]`, `t` is equal to `child[1]`, and `max` is updated to the value of `t` if `max` is less than 0 or greater than `t`.***
