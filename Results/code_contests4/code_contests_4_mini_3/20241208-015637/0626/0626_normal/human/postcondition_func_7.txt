The function accepts a `node`, which is a list containing information about a vertex in a tree structure, and a `parent`, which is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current node. It recursively processes the child vertices of the given node, removing the last occurrence of the parent from the list of child vertices if found. The function does not return any value, and it modifies the `node` in place. The function does not compute or return any information related to the number of apples in leaf vertices or their relationships; it only focuses on modifying the list of child vertices.
