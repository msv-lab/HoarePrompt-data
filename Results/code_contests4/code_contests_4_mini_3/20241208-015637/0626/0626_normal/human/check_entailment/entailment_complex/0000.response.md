Based on the provided problem description and the annotations for the functions, we need to analyze whether the code meets the requirements of making the tree balanced by removing the minimum number of apples from leaf vertices.

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - A tree is balanced if all its subtrees corresponding to the children of any vertex have equal weight.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of apples required to be removed from the tree to achieve this balance.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The functions seem to focus on input handling and tree traversal without implementing the necessary logic to compute the required number of apples to be removed.
   - Specifically:
     - **func_6** and **func_7** contain logical errors and do not seem to compute the least common multiple (LCM) or handle weights correctly.
     - **func_9** attempts to calculate an LCM based on children, but the logic and structure are unclear, and it does not return meaningful data relevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The annotations suggest that the functions do not address the main task of calculating the minimum apples to remove to balance the tree.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider a simple case where the tree has only two leaves with different weights. The logic to check if weights are equal and compute the difference (number of apples to be removed) is missing.
   - The code does not handle inputs where there are varying weights among the leaves, which is crucial for determining the minimum number of apples to remove.
   - The function annotations indicate that the functions do not validate or process this data correctly.

In conclusion, the code does not implement the required logic to determine the minimum number of apples to remove to achieve the balance in the tree as per the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
