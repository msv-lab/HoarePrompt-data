The function accepts no parameters and returns the first element from the output of the function `func_3()`, which is expected to provide relevant information regarding the number of vertices and the number of apples in the leaf vertices of a tree. However, the exact nature of this information and potential edge cases related to the output of `func_3()` are not specified in the provided code.
