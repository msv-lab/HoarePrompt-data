node is a tree represented as a rooted structure with n vertices where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer representing the number of apples (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8), and non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. The edges connecting the vertices are given as pairs of integers.
