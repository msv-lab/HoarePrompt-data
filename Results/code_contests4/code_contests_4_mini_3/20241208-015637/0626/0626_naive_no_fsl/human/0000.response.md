Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for counting the minimum number of apples that need to be removed to balance the tree. 

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following tree configuration:

Input:
```
5
0 0 10 10 5
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
```

In this case:
- Vertex 1 is the root with 0 apples.
- Vertices 2 and 3 are children of the root, both having 0 apples, which makes their subtree weights equal, but vertices 4 and 5 have 10 and 5 apples respectively. 
- The weights of the subtrees rooted at vertex 2 are 10 (from vertex 4) and 5 (from vertex 5). Hence, the subtree weights are not equal: `10 (from vertex 4) != 5 (from vertex 5)`.

To make the tree balanced, we need to remove apples from either vertex 4 or vertex 5. Specifically, we can remove 5 apples from vertex 5, which would result in both children of vertex 2 having a subtree weight of 10.

However, the program's logic does not correctly calculate the required apples to be removed in cases like this, as it is not designed to handle the case where the leaf nodes contribute differing weights effectively. The calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) and the maximum weight logic does not align with the requirement to ensure that all child subtrees of a parent have equal weight.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements correctly for all possible cases.
