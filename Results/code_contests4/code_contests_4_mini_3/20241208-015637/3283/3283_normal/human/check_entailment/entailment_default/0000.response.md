To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program, we will break down the problem description and the code. 

### Problem Description:
Jack is trying to reach a point `x` on a number line starting from point zero. He jumps in a pattern where the first jump is of length 1, the second jump is of length 2, and so on, with the ability to jump either left or right. The task is to determine the minimal number of jumps required to reach point `x`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
from math import*

n = abs(input())
d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
```
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer input `n` (the absolute value of the input). However, it does not handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. **Calculation of `d`**: The formula used to calculate `d` is derived from the quadratic equation, which seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of jumps required to exceed or reach `n`. The calculation seems reasonable based on the problem statement.
3. **Output Logic**: The output logic uses a lookup table based on the parity of `n` and `d`, which is not immediately clear without further context. It seems to account for specific conditions based on the modulus of `n` and `d` but needs clarification on how these mappings were derived.

### Output Hints:
The output hints mention that:
- The program accepts no parameters and reads an integer input `n`.
- It prints a value derived from a specific lookup based on the parity of `n` and `d`.
- There is concern regarding edge cases like invalid input, which are not handled in the code.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Negative Input**: The program uses `abs(input())`, but if `input()` is negative, it should ideally handle that and return an appropriate result or error message. The problem description does allow for negative values, and the handling should reflect that.
2. **Non-integer Input**: If a non-integer input is given, the program will throw an error. This is a significant edge case that the program does not handle.
3. **Large Numbers**: Given the constraints (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), the calculations should ideally remain efficient without running into performance issues. The code appears to handle this correctly, but it should be confirmed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fully adhere to the problem description due to its lack of handling for negative and non-integer inputs, which are potential cases that could arise based on the input constraints. 

Therefore, the correctness assessment is as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle edge cases correctly, particularly negative inputs and non-integer inputs, which makes it incorrect according to the problem description.
