Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` but does not convert it to an integer before taking its absolute value. Instead, it should read an integer directly. Additionally, `abs(input())` will cause a TypeError since `input()` returns a string.

2. **Mathematical Logic**: The formula used in the program to calculate the number of jumps (`d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))`) is not derived correctly for the given problem. The problem requires the calculation of the minimum number of jumps to reach position `x` on the number line, but the formula appears to be based on an incorrect interpretation of the jumping mechanics.

3. **Output Logic**: The method of calculating the result using a matrix-like indexing `print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d` is not aligned with the requirements of the problem description. The conditions of the jumps (whether to jump left or right) have not been properly accounted for in the logic.

4. **Test Cases**: For the provided test cases:
   - For input `2`, the expected output is `3`, but the program may not yield this correctly due to the issues mentioned above.
   - For input `6`, the expected output is also `3`, and again the program may fail to produce this output.
   - For input `0`, the expected output is `0`, which may be handled correctly; however, this does not compensate for the overall incorrectness of the logic.

In summary, due to the flaws in input handling, mathematical logic employed, and output generation, the program does not meet the specifications set forth in the problem description.
