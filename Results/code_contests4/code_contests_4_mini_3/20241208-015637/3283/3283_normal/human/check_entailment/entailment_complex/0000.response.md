The provided Python program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem statement. 

Firstly, the function definition is missing a parameter to accept the input value `x`, which is required according to the problem description. The function instead uses `input()` directly, which is not compatible with the function signature as it stands and does not adhere to the expected input structure.

Secondly, the calculation of `d` is based on a formula derived from a quadratic equation, but the explanation lacks clarity regarding how it relates to Jack's jumping mechanics. The provided formula appears to focus on determining some jump metric, but it does not directly correlate to the requirement of counting the minimal number of jumps needed to reach the point `x`. 

Additionally, the output logic involves a complex indexing operation with a predefined lookup table, which is not aligned with the problem statement's requirement of outputting the minimal number of jumps. This lookup table's logic does not clearly relate to Jack's jumping method, leading to potential incorrect outputs for valid inputs.

Lastly, the code also does not handle edge cases correctly, such as negative values for `n` or invalid inputs, which could lead to runtime errors.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
