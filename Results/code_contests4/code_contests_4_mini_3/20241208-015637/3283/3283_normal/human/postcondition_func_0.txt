The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer input `n` (expected to be non-negative), calculates a value `d` based on the formula derived from the quadratic equation, and prints a value derived from a specific lookup based on the parity of `n` and `d`. The output behavior is not clearly defined in the annotations, and potential edge cases include handling of invalid input (non-integer or negative values), which are not addressed in the code.
