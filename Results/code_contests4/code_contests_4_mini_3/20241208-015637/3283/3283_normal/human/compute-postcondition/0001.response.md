`d` is assigned the value of the expression `int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))`. The value of `n` is the absolute value of the input integer, which means `n` is a non-negative integer. The calculation involves taking the square root of `1 + 8 * n`, then subtracting `1`, dividing by `2`, and finally applying the ceiling function before converting the result to an integer.

Since `n` can vary, `d` will depend on the specific value of `n`. The output state will represent `n` as an absolute non-negative integer and `d` as the computed integer based on the formula.

Output State: **`n` is the absolute value of the input integer; `d` is an integer calculated from the formula `int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))`**.
