The value of `n` is assigned the absolute value of the input. The function `input()` accepts an input which will be converted to an integer, and the absolute value function `abs()` ensures that `n` will always be non-negative. The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; `n` is the absolute value of the input integer.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; `n` is the absolute value of the input integer.**
