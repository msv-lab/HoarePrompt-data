To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to consider the variables `n` and `d` based on the initial state.

Given:
- `n` is the absolute value of the input integer.
- `d` is calculated using the formula `int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))`.

The code snippet:
```
print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
```

Step by step:
1. The expression `n % 2` computes the remainder when `n` is divided by 2, which determines whether `n` is even or odd.
2. The expression `d % 4` computes the remainder when `d` is divided by 4.
3. We access the list `[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]]` using the results of the two expressions. The first index corresponds to `n % 2` (0 or 1), and the second index corresponds to `d % 4` (0, 1, 2, or 3).
4. The result from the list is then added to `d`.

The output state will reflect the computed values based on the values of `n` and `d`.

Output State: **`n` is the absolute value of the input integer; `d` is an integer calculated from the formula `int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))`; the final result is computed from the expression `[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d`.**
