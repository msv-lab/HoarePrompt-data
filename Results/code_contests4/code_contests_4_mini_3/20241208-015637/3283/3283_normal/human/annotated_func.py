#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = abs(input())
    d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
    print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer input `n` (expected to be non-negative), calculates a value `d` based on the formula derived from the quadratic equation, and prints a value derived from a specific lookup based on the parity of `n` and `d`. The output behavior is not clearly defined in the annotations, and potential edge cases include handling of invalid input (non-integer or negative values), which are not addressed in the code.
