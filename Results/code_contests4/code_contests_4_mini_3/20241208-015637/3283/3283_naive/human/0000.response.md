To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's first analyze the requirements:

**Problem Description:**
Jack starts at point zero on a number line and wants to reach point `x`. He can jump either left or right, with each jump being one unit longer than the previous jump. We need to determine the minimal number of jumps required for Jack to reach `x`.

**Program:**
```python
n = abs(input())
d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
```

**Analysis of the Program:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `n = abs(input())`: This line attempts to take input, but it does not convert it to an integer. The `input()` function returns a string, which should be converted to an integer first. This will cause an error if `x` is negative, as `abs()` is not necessary because the function is supposed to handle both positive and negative values.

2. **Calculation of D:**
   - The calculation of `d` using the formula `int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))` is an attempt to find the minimal number of jumps needed based on some mathematical derivation. However, the calculation assumes that `n` is already properly defined as a non-negative integer, which might not be the case due to the input handling issue. 

3. **Output Logic:**
   - The output logic `print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d` is attempting to use a nested list to adjust the output based on the parity of `n` and `d`. This is obscure and may not produce the correct output for all possible values of `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case when `x = 0`. The expected output for this case is `0`, but the way the program is structured may not correctly output this, especially since the input conversion is not handled properly.

**Conclusion:**
Given the analysis, we can identify several points of failure:
- The input is not correctly converted to an integer, leading to potential errors.
- The calculation and output logic are not straightforward and may not cover all edge cases, particularly `x = 0`.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description correctly for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
