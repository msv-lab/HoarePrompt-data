To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements.

The goal is to determine the minimal number of jumps Jack needs to reach a point `x` on the number line, starting from 0. The sequence of jumps starts with a jump of 1 unit, and each subsequent jump increases by 1 unit.

The provided program is:

```python
n = abs(input())
d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
```

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The input is read using `input()` but is not converted to an integer. It is wrapped in `abs()`, which does not work correctly since `input()` returns a string. This will raise an error when trying to apply `abs()` on a string.
   
2. **Mathematical Logic**:
   - The formula used to calculate `d` seems based on a mathematical approach to reach the target using triangular numbers. However, the logic of adjusting the result based on the parity of `n` and `d` is not straightforward and could lead to incorrect outputs.
   
3. **Test Cases**:
   - For example, if we input `2`, the expected output is `3` based on the problem description. However, due to the input handling issue, the code will not produce this output correctly. The same applies to other cases like `6` and `0`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle negative inputs correctly because of the `abs()` function applied on input as a string.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the code, particularly with input handling and potentially incorrect logic for calculating jumps, we can assert that the program fails to meet the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for valid inputs, such as `2` or `6`, and will raise an error due to incorrect input handling.
