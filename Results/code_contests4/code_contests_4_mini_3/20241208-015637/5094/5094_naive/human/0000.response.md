To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic and see if it fulfills the requirements stated in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - Two integers, `n` (number of towers) and `k` (maximum slice cost).
   - An array of integers representing the heights of the towers.

2. **Output:**
   - The minimum number of good slices needed to make all towers the same height, where a good slice's cost does not exceed `k`.

3. **Operation Definition:**
   - A slice at height `H` removes cubes from any tower taller than `H`. The cost is the total number of removed cubes.

4. **Good Slices:**
   - A slice is considered good if its cost is less than or equal to `k`.

### Analyzing the Program
```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    h = Counter(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    (tot, cnt) = (0, 0)
    slices = 0
    for i in range(200000, min(h) - 1, -1):
        if i in h:
            tot += h[i]
        if cnt + tot > k:
            cnt = tot
            slices += 1
        else:
            cnt += tot
    print(slices)
```

1. The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the heights of the towers.
2. It attempts to iterate from the maximum possible height down to the minimum height present in the towers.
3. It checks if the cumulative count of cubes removed exceeds `k` to determine when to count a slice.

### Issues with the Program
- The loop runs from `200000` down to `min(h) - 1`. However, `min(h)` is the height of the shortest tower. The loop condition `range(200000, min(h) - 1, -1)` could lead to an error if `min(h)` is higher than `200000`, which contradicts the constraints where `1 ≤ h_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. This will lead to the loop never executing if `min(h)` is 200000 or less.
- The logic that checks if `cnt + tot > k` might not accurately track the cost of slices since `tot` represents the total number of cubes at height `i`, and it resets `cnt` incorrectly, potentially leading to miscalculations of how many slices should be counted.

### Potential Failure Case
Consider the following case:

Input:
```
5 5
3 3 3 3 3
```

In this case:
- The heights are all 3, and to make them the same height, you wouldn't need to make any slices since they are already the same height.
- The expected output would be `0` slices, but due to the structure of the provided code, it may not handle this case correctly because it may mistakenly count slices when it shouldn't.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified with the logic of the program and the potential case where the program may not return the expected output, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
