The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. Instead, it operates on three external inputs: `n`, `k`, and `h`. 

1. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of towers, constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
2. `k` is an integer representing the maximum allowed cost for slices, constrained such that n ≤ k ≤ 1,000,000,000.
3. `h` is a list of integers where each integer represents the height of a tower, with each height constrained to the range 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 200,000.

After executing the function's logic, it returns a value based on these inputs. The specific return value and logic used to determine it are not described in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer n representing the number of towers, an integer k representing the maximum allowed cost for slices, and a list h of tower heights. It returns a value based on these inputs.**
