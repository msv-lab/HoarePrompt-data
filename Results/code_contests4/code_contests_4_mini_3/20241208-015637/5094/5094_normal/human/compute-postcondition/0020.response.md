Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), and `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000. If `cnt + tot` is greater than `k`, then `tot` remains unchanged, `cnt` is now equal to `tot`, `slices` is either 1 or 2, and `i` remains the same. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + tot`.***
