The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000 and `k` is an integer within the range of `n` to 1,000,000,000, both variables will take on values based on the input provided. The list `h` remains unchanged and is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the input values for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), and `h` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ `h_i` ≤ 200,000)**.
