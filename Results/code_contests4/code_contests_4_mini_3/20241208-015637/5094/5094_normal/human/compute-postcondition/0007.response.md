Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000, `tot` is set to `h[i]`, `cnt` is 0, `slices` is 0, and `i` is a key in `h` if `i` is in `h`. If `i` is not in `h`, no changes are made to `tot`, `cnt`, `slices`, or `i`.***
