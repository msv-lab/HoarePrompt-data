Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000; `tot` is the total occurrences counted from `h`, `cnt` is the total occurrences that do not exceed `k`, `slices` is the number of times the accumulated count has exceeded `k`, and we print the value of `slices`.**
