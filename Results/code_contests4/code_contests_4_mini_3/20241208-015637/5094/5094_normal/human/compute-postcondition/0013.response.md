Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000, `tot` is set to `h[i]`, and `i` is a key in `h`. If `cnt + tot` is greater than `k`, then `cnt` is equal to `tot`, `slices` is 1, and `i` remains as a key in `h`. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + tot`, `slices` is 0, and `i` is still a key in `h.***
