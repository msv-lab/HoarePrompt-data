Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000, `tot` is updated to `tot + h[i]`, `cnt` is updated based on the condition involving the new value of `tot`, `slices` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous condition, and `i` is decremented to `i - 1` with the loop condition checking that `i` is still greater than or equal to `min(h)`.**
