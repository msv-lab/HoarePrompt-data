The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of `tot`. The values of `tot`, `cnt`, `slices`, and `i` remain unchanged in this assignment, but `cnt` now holds the value that `tot` had before this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000, `tot` is unchanged, `cnt` is now equal to `tot`, `slices` is 0 or 1, and `i` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000, `tot` is unchanged, `cnt` is now equal to `tot`, `slices` is 0 or 1, and `i` remains the same.**
