Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000, `tot` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `slices` is 0, `i` is 200000, for the loop to execute the first time `min(h) ≤ 200,000, and `i` is a key in `h`.***
