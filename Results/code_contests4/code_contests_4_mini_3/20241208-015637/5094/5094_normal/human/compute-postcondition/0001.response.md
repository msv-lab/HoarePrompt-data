The variable `h` is assigned the value of `Counter(map(int, input().split(' ')))`, which means that `h` will be a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the input list of `n` integers. Since `h` was previously a list of integers, it gets transformed into a `Counter` object where the keys are the integers from the input list and the values are their respective counts. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object counting occurrences of input integers.**
