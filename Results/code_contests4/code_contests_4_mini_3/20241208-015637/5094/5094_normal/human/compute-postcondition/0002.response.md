The variables `tot` and `cnt` are both assigned initial values of 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `h` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object counting occurrences of input integers; `tot` is 0, `cnt` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object counting occurrences of input integers; `tot` is 0, `cnt` is 0**
