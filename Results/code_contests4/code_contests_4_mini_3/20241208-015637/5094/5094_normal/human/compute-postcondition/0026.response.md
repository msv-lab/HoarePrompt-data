Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer (`n` ≤ `k` ≤ 1,000,000,000), `h` is a Counter object with at least one key value ≤ 200,000, `cnt` is either equal to `tot` if `cnt + tot` is greater than `k`, or updated to `cnt + tot`; `slices` is either 1 or 2; `i` is decremented by 1; `tot` is updated to `tot + h[i]` if `i` exists in `h`; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + tot`.**
