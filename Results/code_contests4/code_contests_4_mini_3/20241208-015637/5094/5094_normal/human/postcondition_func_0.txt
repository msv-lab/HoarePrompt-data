The function accepts two integers, `n` (the number of towers) and `k` (the maximum allowed cost for slices), and a list `h` representing the heights of the towers. It calculates the number of slices required based on the heights of the towers such that the accumulated count of heights does not exceed `k`. The function prints the number of slices needed when the total count exceeds `k`. It does not return any value; it only prints the result.
