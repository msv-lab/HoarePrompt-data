The function accepts a list of N positive integers `a`, where 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and returns the result of `func_3` applied to `a` and the value `mod - 2`. The functionality of `func_3` is not defined here, so the exact output depends on its implementation. There are no additional checks or error handling in this function, such as validating the contents of `a` or ensuring that `mod` is defined within this context.
