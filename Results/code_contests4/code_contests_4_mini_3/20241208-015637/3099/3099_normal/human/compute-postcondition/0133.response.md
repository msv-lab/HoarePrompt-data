According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `i * i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore. For the loop to execute again, it must be ensured that `i * i` is still less than or equal to `x`.

Since `i` is 3, `i * i` equals 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be at least 9. 

The state of `x` is currently such that it is less than or equal to 8 (as it is not divisible by 3 anymore, and 9 is the next perfect square). Hence, we need to adjust `x` to be at least 9.

State: **`x` is at least 9, `cnt[i]` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]` corresponding to `i`, `i` is 3**
