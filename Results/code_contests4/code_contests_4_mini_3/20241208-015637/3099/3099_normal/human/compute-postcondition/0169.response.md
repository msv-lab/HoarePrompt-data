According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `answer[prime]`, which determines how many times the loop will run. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `x` is 1 or less, indicating that the loop has executed `answer[prime]` times minus 1. Since `_` is currently 0, this indicates that the loop has executed once and will execute again if `answer[prime]` is greater than the current value of `_`.

To execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next state for `_` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `answer[prime]` must be greater than 1 (since the loop runs as long as `_` is less than `answer[prime]`).

State: **`x` is 1 or less, `cnt` contains prime factors of the last element of `arr` with their respective counts, `lcm` is updated by func_2 with the next prime factor from `answer`, for the loop to execute a second time `answer[prime]` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1**
