Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `cnt` contains the prime factor counts of the original value of `arr[2]`, and `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `arr[2]`. If `x` is greater than 1, `cnt[x]` is updated to `cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged since `x` is equal to 1.***
