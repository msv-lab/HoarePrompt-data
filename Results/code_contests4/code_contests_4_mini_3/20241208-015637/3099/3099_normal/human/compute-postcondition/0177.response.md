According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `answer[prime]`. If `answer[prime]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 or less, `answer` must contain at least one prime, `answer[prime]` is at least 2, and `prime` is the next prime in the `answer` iterable. 

Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `answer[prime]` needs to be decremented by 1, which would make it at least 1 (since it's at least 2 currently), and the loop will iterate again. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `lcm` remains updated by applying `func_2` with the current values of `lcm` and `prime`, and the loop counter will increment.

State: **`x` is 1 or less, `answer` must contain at least one prime, `answer[prime]` is at least 1, and `prime` is the next prime in the `answer` iterable**.
