According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will continue as long as `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). At the end of the last iteration, `x` is greater than 2 and even, and `i` is 2. Since `x` is even, it is divisible by 2, so the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments.

Thus, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed one more time.

State: **`x` is greater than 2 and even; `cnt` is {2: 2}; `i` is 2**
