The variable `cnt` is updated using the value of `x`. The expression `cnt.get(x, 0)` retrieves the current count of `x` from `cnt`, defaulting to `0` if `x` is not already a key in `cnt`. Since `x` is not equal to `1`, and given that `cnt` contains the prime factorization counts of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by `1`. The other variables `x` and `i` remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `cnt` has been updated to include one more count for `x`, `i` is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]`, and `x` is not equal to 1.

Output State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `cnt` has been updated to include one more count for `x`, `i` is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]`, and `x` is not equal to 1.**
