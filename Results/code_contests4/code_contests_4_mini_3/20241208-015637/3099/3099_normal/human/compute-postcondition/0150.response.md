The variable `answer[key]` is assigned the maximum value between `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`. The value of `answer.get(key, 0)` retrieves the current value of `answer[key]`, defaulting to `0` if `key` is not already in `answer`. The value of `cnt[key]` is taken directly from the `cnt` dictionary for the specific `key`. Since `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt[key]` will have a defined value.

Therefore, after executing the line of code, `answer[key]` will reflect the maximum count between its current stored value (or `0` if it does not exist) and the count from `cnt[key]`. The variable `x` and `cnt` are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary containing prime factor counts, and `answer[key]` is updated to the maximum of its current value or `cnt[key]`.**
