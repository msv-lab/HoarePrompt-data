According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be such that `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= x`. 

Since `i * i` is currently less than or equal to `x`, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still within the bounds required for the loop condition. Therefore, we can say that `x` must be greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` for the loop to run again.

State: **`x` is not divisible by `i`; `cnt[i]` is the count of how many times `i` divided into the original value of `x`; for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1)**
