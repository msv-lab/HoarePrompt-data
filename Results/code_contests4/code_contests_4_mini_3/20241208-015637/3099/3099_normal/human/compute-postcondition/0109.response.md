To determine whether the loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `i * i <= x`. The loop will execute if the product of `i` multiplied by itself is less than or equal to `x`.

1. The variable `x` is assigned a value from `arr[2]`, which means it will hold a specific value depending on the content of the `arr` array.
2. The variable `i` needs to be evaluated. If `i` is initialized to a non-negative value, we can then check whether `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `i` must be a non-negative integer.
- The condition `i * i <= x` must hold true.

If `i` is `0`, the condition will be true for any non-negative `x`. If `i` is `1`, the condition will hold true if `x` is `1` or greater. If `i` is `2`, then `x` must be `4` or greater, and so on.

Since we donâ€™t have the specific values of `i` or `arr[2]`, we should assume `i` is initialized to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`x` is assigned the value from `arr[2]`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is a non-negative integer such that i * i <= x**
