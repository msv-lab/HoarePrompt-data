The variable `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. This means that it will retrieve the current value of `cnt[i]`, if it exists, or default to `0` if it does not, and then increment that value by `1`. The values of `x` and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the changes to the `cnt` dictionary based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` is at least 3; `i` is unchanged; `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1**
