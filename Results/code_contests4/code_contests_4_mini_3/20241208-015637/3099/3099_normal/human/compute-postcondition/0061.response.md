`cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The dictionary `cnt` is currently empty, so `cnt.get(i, 0)` returns `0`. Therefore, `cnt[i]` is updated to `0 + 1`, which is `1`. The other variables (`x` and `i`) remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `x` is greater than 4 and even; `cnt` is {2: 1}; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 4 and even; `cnt` is {2: 1}; `i` is 2**
