To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i * i <= x`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]` divided by `i` raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed.

After the last iteration, `i` must have reached a value such that `i * i` is less than or equal to `x` before the increment. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following condition must hold true after the increment:

1. The value of `i` after increment (let's denote it as `i' = i + 1`) should satisfy the condition `i' * i' <= x`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is set to a value such that `i + 1` squared is less than or equal to `x`. Hence, `i` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to the square root of `x` minus 1.

Thus, we can conclude:
- We need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x`.

State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]` divided by `i` raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x` minus 1.**
