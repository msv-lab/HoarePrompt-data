The value of `cnt[i]` is updated by taking the current value from the dictionary `cnt` for the key `i` (which defaults to 0 if `i` is not present) and adding 1 to it. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1, so the operation affects `cnt[1]`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value from `arr[2]`, `i` is 1, and `cnt[1]` is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1`.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value from `arr[2]`, `i` is 1, and `cnt[1]` is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1.**
