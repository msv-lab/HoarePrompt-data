According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i * i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `i` has been increased by 1. This means that the new value of `i` is 2. 

Now evaluating the condition: 
- For the loop to execute again, `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`. 
- Currently, `i` is 2, so `i * i` equals 4.
- Since 4 is not less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute again.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `x` so that it is at least 4 (since `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`).

State: **`x` is adjusted to be at least 4, `cnt` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]`, and `i` is now 2**
