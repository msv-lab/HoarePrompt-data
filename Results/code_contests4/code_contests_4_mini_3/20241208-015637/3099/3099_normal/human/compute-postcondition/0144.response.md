The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown since it is not defined in the initial state. The values of `x` and `cnt[3]` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1, `cnt[3]` is 2, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `cnt[3]` is 2, and `i` is increased by 1**
