The statement `cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` updates the `cnt` dictionary. It retrieves the current value associated with the key `i` if it exists; otherwise, it defaults to `0`. It then increments this value by `1` and assigns it back to `cnt[i]`. The initial state mentions `x` and its conditions, but the code only affects the `cnt` dictionary and not other variables. Therefore, the output state is focused on the changes in `cnt`.

Output State: **`cnt[i]` is updated to be `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`**
