The value of `x` is updated by dividing it by `i`, which means `x` is now `x / i`. Given that `x` is at least 2 and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `x` should be at least `i * i`, we do not have specific values for `x` and `i`, but we know they meet these conditions. 

Thus, the new value of `x` will be less than the original value but still need to be evaluated based on the relation to `i`. The output state will reflect this change to `x`.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `x / i`, where `x` is at least 2 and `x` is still at least `i * i` for the loop to execute again.**
