The variable `cnt` is updated by assigning to `cnt[i]` the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The `get(i, 0)` method retrieves the current count of the prime factor `i` (which is 2) from the dictionary `cnt`. If `i` does not exist in `cnt`, it defaults to 0. After retrieving this value, we add 1 to it to account for the current occurrence of the prime factor.

Since `x` is at least 2, and we know that `i` is 2, the code is specifically updating the count for the prime factor 2. The exact previous value of `cnt[2]` is unknown, but we can assume it will be incremented.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the count of the prime factor 2 in `cnt` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `cnt[2]` is updated to be `cnt.get(2, 0) + 1`**
