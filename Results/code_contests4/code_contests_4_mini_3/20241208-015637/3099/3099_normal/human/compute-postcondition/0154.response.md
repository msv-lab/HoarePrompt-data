The statement assigns a value to `answer[key]`, which is the maximum between the current value of `answer[key]` (defaulting to 0 if `key` is not in `answer`) and `cnt[key]`, which is an existing entry in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary and has at least one key available to process, the values of `answer[key]` will be updated based on the maximum value calculated. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `x` is 2, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary, and `answer[key]` is updated based on the maximum value between `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary, and `answer[key]` is updated based on the maximum value between `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]**
