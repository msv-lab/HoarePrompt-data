The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The values of `x` and `cnt` are not affected, and since the code does not specify any condition or loop regarding `arr[2]`, we only note the change to `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1, `cnt` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `cnt` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]`, and `i` is increased by 1**
