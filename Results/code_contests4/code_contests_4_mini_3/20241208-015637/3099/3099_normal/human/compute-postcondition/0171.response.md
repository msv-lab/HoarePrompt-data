According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `answer[prime]`. For the loop to execute again, `answer[prime]` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 or less, and `_` is 1, meaning the loop has executed once already. Since `answer[prime]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, it implies that after the last iteration, `answer[prime]` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `answer[prime]` must be at least 2 before the next iteration.

State: **`x` is 1 or less, `cnt` contains prime factors of the last element of `arr` with their respective counts, `lcm` is updated by func_2 with the next prime factor from `answer`, for the loop to execute a second time `answer[prime]` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2**
