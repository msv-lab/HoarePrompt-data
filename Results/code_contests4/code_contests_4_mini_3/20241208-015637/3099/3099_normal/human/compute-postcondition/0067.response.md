`cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, and `cnt` currently has a key 2 with a value of 2. The `get` method retrieves the value associated with the key 2 in `cnt`, which is 2, and if the key did not exist, it would return 0. Therefore, `cnt[2]` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1 and even; `cnt` is {2: 3}; `i` is 2**
