The value of `x` is divided by `i`, where `x` is at least 9 and `i` is 3. Therefore, `x` will be updated to at least 9 / 3 = 3. The values of `cnt[i]` and other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `x` is at least 3, `cnt[i]` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]` corresponding to `i`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is at least 3, `cnt[i]` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]` corresponding to `i`, `i` is 3**
