The expression `x /= i` divides the value of `x` by `i` and assigns the result back to `x`. Since `x` is at least 2 and `i` is a divisor of `x`, the operation will result in `x` being reduced to a value that is still valid (greater than or equal to 1). The specific values of `x` and `i` are not provided, but we know that `x` will be modified by the division operation. The output state will reflect the updated value of `x` based on this operation.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `x / i`, where `x` is at least 2 and `i` is a divisor of `x`.**
