According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition given by `answer[prime]`. If `answer[prime]` is greater than 1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 or less, and `answer` contains at least one prime with `answer[prime]` being at least 1. Since `answer[prime]` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `answer[prime]` must be at least 2. Additionally, since the loop body is executed, the value of `_` will increase by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, after the next iteration, `_` will be 1 and for the loop to execute again, `answer[prime]` must be at least 2.

State: **`x` is 1 or less, `answer` must contain at least one prime, `answer[prime]` is at least 2, and `lcm` is updated based on `func_2(lcm, prime)`**
