According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will continue as long as `x % i` equals 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is divided by `i`, meaning that `x` has been reduced. For the loop to execute again, `x` must still be divisible by `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `i` times its previous value (since it was divided by `i`).

State: **`x` is equal to `i` times its previous value, `cnt[2]` is either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[2]` incremented by 1, `cnt[i]` is either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[i]` incremented by 1**
