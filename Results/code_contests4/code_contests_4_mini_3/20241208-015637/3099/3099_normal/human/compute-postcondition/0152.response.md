The variable `answer[key]` is assigned the maximum value between `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`. The value of `cnt[key]` is determined from the dictionary `cnt`, which contains prime factor counts. If `key` is not already in `answer`, `answer.get(key, 0)` will return 0. The execution of this line updates `answer` based on the comparison of these two values.

Given that `x` is 2 and `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary, the values of `x` and `cnt` are not directly affected by this line. However, `answer` will be updated according to the values from `cnt`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 2, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary containing prime factor counts, and `answer[key]` is updated based on the maximum value between `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary containing prime factor counts, and `answer[key]` is updated based on the maximum value between `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`.**
