According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `i * i <= x`, meaning that for the loop to execute, the square of `i` must be less than or equal to `x`. Right before the loop, `i` is 2, which is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]`. This implies that `x` must be greater than `i * i` (which is 4 in this case) for the loop to execute.

Since `x` is assigned the value of `arr[2]`, we need to ensure that `arr[2]` is greater than 4. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to ensure the loop condition is satisfied.

State: **`x` is assigned the value of `arr[2]` which needs to be greater than 4, `cnt` remains an empty dictionary, `i` is 2**
