The value of `cnt[i]` is updated based on the current value of `cnt.get(i, 0)`, which retrieves the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt`, defaulting to 0 if `i` is not present. The previous value of `cnt[1]` is unknown, but it is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1`. Since `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is `arr[2] / 1`, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is updated to the previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`x` is `arr[2] / 1`, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1**
