The variable `x` is divided by `i`. Since `i` is 2, we have `x = x / 2`. The initial state indicates that `x` is greater than 2 and even, so after the operation, `x` will remain greater than 1 and still even. The values of `cnt` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is greater than 1 and even; `cnt` is {2: 2}; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1 and even; `cnt` is {2: 2}; `i` is 2**
