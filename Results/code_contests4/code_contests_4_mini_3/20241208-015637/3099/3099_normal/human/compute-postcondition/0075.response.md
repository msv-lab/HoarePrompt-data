The value of `x` is updated to be `x / i`. The previous state indicates that `x` is divisible by `i` in order for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the value of `x` is changed according to the division operation. The other variables in the state, specifically `cnt[i]`, are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`cnt[i]` is updated to be `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`, and `x` is updated to `x / i`.**
