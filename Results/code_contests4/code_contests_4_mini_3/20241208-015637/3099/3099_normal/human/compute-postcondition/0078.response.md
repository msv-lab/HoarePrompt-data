The value of `x` is updated by dividing it by `i`. The specific previous values of `x` and `i` are not provided, so the exact result of the division cannot be determined. However, the action taken on `x` is clear. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt[i]` is updated to be `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`, `x` is now adjusted to be `x / i`.

Output State: **`cnt[i]` is updated to be `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`, `x` is now adjusted to be `x / i`**.
