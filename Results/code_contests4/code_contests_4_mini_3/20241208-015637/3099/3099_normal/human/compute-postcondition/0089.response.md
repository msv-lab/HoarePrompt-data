According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x % i` equals 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the smallest multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1). This means that `x` is already a multiple of `i`, and thus `x % i` will equal 0, allowing the loop to potentially execute again.

Since `x` is defined in relation to `i`, and given that `x` is a multiple of `i`, there is no need to adjust `x` or `i` for the loop to execute one more time. The condition `x % i == 0` holds true based on the current state.

State: **`x` is the smallest multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1); `cnt[i]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1**
