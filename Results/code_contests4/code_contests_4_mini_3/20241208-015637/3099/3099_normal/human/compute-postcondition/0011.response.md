According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `x` is divisible by `i`, which means `x % i` must equal 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is currently divided by `i`, indicating that `x % i` is 0, and therefore the loop can execute one more time. No states need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed.

State: **`x` is divided by `i`; `cnt[2]` is either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[2]` incremented by 1**
