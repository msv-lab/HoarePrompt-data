The value of `x` is assigned the result of `x` divided by `i`. Given that `x` is at least 3 and that `i` is unchanged, the new value of `x` will be `x / i`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `x` must remain a multiple of `i`, which might still hold true after the division depending on the values of `x` and `i`. However, the specific new value of `x` is not known without the actual value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is at least 3; `i` is unchanged; `x` is now `x / i`.
Output State: **`x` is at least 3; `i` is unchanged; `x` is now `x / i**
