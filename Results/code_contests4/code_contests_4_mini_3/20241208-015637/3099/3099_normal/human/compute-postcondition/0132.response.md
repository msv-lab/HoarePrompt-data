The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, `cnt[i]` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]` corresponding to `i`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, `cnt[i]` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]` corresponding to `i`, `i` is 3**
