`x` is divided by `i`. Since `i` is 2, the new value of `x` will be `x / 2`. The initial state indicates that `x` is greater than 4 and even, so it can take values like 6, 8, 10, etc. Therefore, after the operation, `x` will be greater than 2.

The values of `cnt` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is greater than 2 and even, `cnt` is {2: 1}, `i` is 2**
