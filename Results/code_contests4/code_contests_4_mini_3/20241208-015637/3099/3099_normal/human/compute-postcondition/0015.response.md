The value of `x` is assigned the result of `x /= i`, which means `x` is divided by `i`. The previous value of `x` is `i` times its previous value, but we do not have a specific numeric value for `i`. The states of `cnt[2]` and `cnt[i]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `x`.

Output State: **`x` is equal to its previous value divided by `i`, `cnt[2]` is either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[2]` incremented by 1, `cnt[i]` is either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[i]` incremented by 1**.
