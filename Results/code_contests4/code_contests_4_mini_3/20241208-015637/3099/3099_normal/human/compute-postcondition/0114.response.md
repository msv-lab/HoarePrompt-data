To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

1. The variable `x` is assigned the value from `arr[2]`, which is not specified but let's denote it as `arr[2]`.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to `1`.
3. The code `x /= i` divides the current value of `x` by `i`. Since `i` is `1`, this operation will not change the value of `x`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is `arr[2]`, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1**
