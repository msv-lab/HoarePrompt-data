According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cnt` dictionary. If `cnt` has more keys, the loop will execute again for the next key. At the end of the last iteration, `key` is the next key in `cnt`. Since `i` is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]`, and `cnt` contains at least one count for `x`, we can assume that `cnt` has multiple keys.

For the loop to execute one more time, `key` must be updated to the next key in `cnt`. If there are more keys in `cnt`, then the loop can continue.

State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `cnt` contains at least one count for `x`, `i` is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `key` is the next key in `cnt`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `cnt` must have at least one more key that follows the current `key`.**
