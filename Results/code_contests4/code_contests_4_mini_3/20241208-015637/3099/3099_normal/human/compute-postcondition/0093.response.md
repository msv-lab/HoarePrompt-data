The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The variable `cnt[i]` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the smallest multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1); `cnt[i]` is the count of how many times `i` divided into the original value of `x`, updated to reflect the total number of divisions performed; `i` is increased by 1.
