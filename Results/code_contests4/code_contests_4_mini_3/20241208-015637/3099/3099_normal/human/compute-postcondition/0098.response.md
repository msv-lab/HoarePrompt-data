According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys in the dictionary `cnt`. For the loop to execute at least once, `cnt` must contain at least one key. Since `x` is 1 or less and `cnt` is updated based on the value of `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, `cnt` must already have been updated to include `x` as a key. 

However, if `x` is equal to 1, it does not contribute to `cnt`, and thus `cnt` may be empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, it is necessary that `cnt` contains at least one key. 

This implies that if `x` is 1 or less, `cnt` must already contain some prime factors for the loop to execute. Additionally, we have the state of `i`, which is greater than the square root of the original value of `arr[2]`, but this does not directly affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`x` is 1 or less, `cnt` contains at least one key, `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `arr[2]`**
