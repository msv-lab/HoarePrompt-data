The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Given that `x` is greater than 4 and even, and `i` is 2, the new value of `x` will be `x / 2`, which is still greater than 2. The values of `cnt` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is greater than 4 and even; `cnt` remains an empty dictionary; `i` is 2; `x` is now greater than 2 after the division.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 4 and even; `cnt` remains an empty dictionary; `i` is 2; `x` is now greater than 2 after the division.**
