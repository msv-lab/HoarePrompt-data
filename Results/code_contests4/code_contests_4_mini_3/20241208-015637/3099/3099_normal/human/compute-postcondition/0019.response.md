According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop continues as long as \( i \times i \) is less than or equal to \( x \). At the end of the last iteration, \( i \) is 3, so we need to check whether \( 3 \times 3 \) (which is 9) is less than or equal to \( x \).

For the loop to execute one more time, \( x \) must be at least 9. Since \( x \) is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]` and no specific value was provided for \( x \), we can only state that \( x \) must be greater than or equal to 9 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is that \( x \) must be at least 9. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]` and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to 9**
