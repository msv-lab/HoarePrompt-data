The function `func_6` accepts no parameters. It operates on a list of positive integers `A` of size `N`, where `N` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 10,000, and each element `A[i]` in the list satisfies the condition of being a positive integer between 1 and 1,000,000. After executing, the function produces an output based on the contents of the list `A`. However, the specific output behavior is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to work with a list of positive integers, processing the data according to its internal logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes a list of N positive integers, where N is between 1 and 10,000, and each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000.**
