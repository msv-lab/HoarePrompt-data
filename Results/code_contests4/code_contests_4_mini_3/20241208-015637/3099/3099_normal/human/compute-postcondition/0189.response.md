The variable `ans` is updated to the result of `func_1(ans, func_2(lcm, func_4(x)))`. The previous value of `ans` is updated based on the outputs of the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_4`, where `x` is the third element of the array `arr`. However, the specific values returned by the functions are not provided, and we only know that `arr` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values for `ans`, `lcm`, or the output of the functions without further information.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the result of `func_1(ans, func_2(lcm, func_4(x)))`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time, `x` is the third element of `arr`.**
