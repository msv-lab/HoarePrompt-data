The value of `cnt[x]` is updated by incrementing its current value by 1. Since `cnt` contains the prime factor counts of the original value of `arr[2]`, `cnt.get(x, 0)` retrieves the current count of the prime factor `x`, which will either be the existing count or 0 if `x` is not a key in `cnt`. The variable `x` is known to be 1, but it is specified that `x` is not equal to 1; hence, `x` must be some value greater than 1. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that the count of the prime factor `x` in `cnt` has increased by 1. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1; `cnt[x]` is updated to `cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`**.
