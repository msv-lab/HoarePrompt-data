To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `i * i <= x`. 

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `x` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`.
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i * i <= x` must be true.

2. **Evaluating the Condition**:
   - Currently, `i` is 2, so `i * i` equals 4.
   - Thus, for the loop to execute, we need `x` (which is `arr[0]`) to be greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Analyzing the State**:
   - Since `arr` is a list of positive integers, `arr[0]` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute.
   - If `arr[0]` is less than 4, the loop will not execute.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the value of `arr[0]` to be at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `A` is a list of N positive integers; `arr` is a list of integers; `answer` is an empty dictionary; `cnt` is an empty dictionary; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `x` is assigned the value of `arr[0]` and for the loop to execute the first time `arr[0]` must be greater than or equal to 4**
