The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The values of `x` and `cnt[2]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `cnt[2]` is the count of how many times 2 is a factor of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `cnt[2]` is the count of how many times 2 is a factor of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `i` is 3**
