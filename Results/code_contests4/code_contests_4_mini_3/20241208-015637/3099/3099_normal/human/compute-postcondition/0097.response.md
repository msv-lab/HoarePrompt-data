Postcondition: ***`x` is 1 or less, `cnt` contains prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]` with their respective counts, and `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `arr[2]`. If `x` is not equal to 1, `cnt` is updated for the key `x` and the count for `x` in `cnt` is incremented by 1.***
