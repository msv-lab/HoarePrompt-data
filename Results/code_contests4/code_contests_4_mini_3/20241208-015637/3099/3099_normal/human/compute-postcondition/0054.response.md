According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it greater than the previous value. Thus, we can infer that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `cnt` contains counts for all keys present, `i` is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]` and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
