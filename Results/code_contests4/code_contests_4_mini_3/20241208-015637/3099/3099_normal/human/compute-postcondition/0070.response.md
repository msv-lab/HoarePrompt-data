According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `i * i <= x`, meaning that for the loop to execute again, `i * i` must still be less than or equal to `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, and `x` is greater than 1. This means that after the last increment, the value of `i` is now one more than its previous value. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the new value of `i`, when squared, is still less than or equal to `x`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, the condition `i * i` must still be less than or equal to `x`. We can state that if `i` has just been incremented, it must have been less than or equal to the square root of `x` before the increment, which implies that `x` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i * i`.

Therefore, we conclude that for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to the square of the incremented `i`.

State: **`x` is greater than 1 and not divisible by 2; `cnt` is {2: the count of how many times 2 divided into the initial value of `arr[2]`}; for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1)**
