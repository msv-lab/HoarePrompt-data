The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input string and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `N` and `A` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `A` is a list of N positive integers where each A[i] satisfies 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `A` is a list of N positive integers where each A[i] satisfies 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer.**
