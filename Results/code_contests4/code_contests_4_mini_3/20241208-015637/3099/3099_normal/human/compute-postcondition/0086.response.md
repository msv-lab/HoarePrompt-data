According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `i`. The loop will continue as long as `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the smallest multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1). This means that `x` is already a multiple of `i`, so the loop can execute again provided that `x` remains a multiple of `i`.

Since `cnt[i]` is updated in the loop body, `cnt[i]` could potentially be incremented again if `x` continues to be divisible by `i`. However, if `x` is adjusted to a value that is not a multiple of `i` in the next iteration, the loop will not execute.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `x` needs to be modified to remain a multiple of `i`. Given that `x` is currently the smallest multiple of `i` greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1), the next smallest multiple of `i` would be `x + i` to ensure `x` is still divisible by `i`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `x` should be set to `x + i` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is the smallest multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1) and for the loop to execute again, `x` is adjusted to `x + i`**
