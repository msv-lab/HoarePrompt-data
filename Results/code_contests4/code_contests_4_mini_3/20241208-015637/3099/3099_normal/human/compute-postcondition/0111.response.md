The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Since `i` is initialized to 1, `x` remains unchanged after the division. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value from `arr[2]`, `i` is 1, and `x` remains unchanged after the division.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value from `arr[2]`, `i` is 1, and `x` remains unchanged after the division.**
