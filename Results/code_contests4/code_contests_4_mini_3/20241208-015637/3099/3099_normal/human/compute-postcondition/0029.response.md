Output State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]` divided by `i` raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed; `cnt[i]` is the total count of how many times `i` divided `x`, and `i` is an odd divisor of the original value of `x` that was used in the last loop iteration. If `x` was no longer divisible by `i`, then the loop has terminated.**
