The variable `i` is 2, and `cnt` is currently `{2: 1}`. The code `cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` retrieves the current value of `cnt[2]`, which is `1`, and adds `1` to it. The value of `cnt[2]` will then be updated to `2`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 2 and even; `cnt` is {2: 2}; `i` is 2**
