`cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The `get` method retrieves the current value of `cnt[i]`, which is not specified but defaults to 0 if `i` is not a key in `cnt`. Since `i` is 2, the new value of `cnt[2]` will be either 1 (if `cnt[2]` was not previously set) or the current value of `cnt[2]` incremented by 1. The values of `x` and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is divided by `i`, `cnt[2]` is either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[2]` incremented by 1.

Output State: **`x` is divided by `i`; `cnt[2]` is either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[2]` incremented by 1.**
