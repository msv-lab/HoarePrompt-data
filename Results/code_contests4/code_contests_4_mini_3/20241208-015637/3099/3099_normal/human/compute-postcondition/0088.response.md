The value of `cnt[i]` is updated by the expression `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. This means that if `i` is already a key in the `cnt` dictionary, its current value will be incremented by 1. If `i` is not a key, it will default to 0, and then 1 will be added, resulting in `cnt[i]` being set to 1. The values of `x` and other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the smallest multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1); `cnt[i]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1.

Output State: **`x` is the smallest multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1); `cnt[i]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1.**
