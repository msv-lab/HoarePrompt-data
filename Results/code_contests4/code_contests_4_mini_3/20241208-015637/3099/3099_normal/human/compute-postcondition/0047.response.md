According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. The loop will execute if `cnt` is a collection (like a list or a dictionary) that contains at least one element. Given that `x` has been updated to include one more count for itself, this suggests that `cnt` should contain `x` and it must not be empty for the loop to execute. Additionally, `key` will take on the values in `cnt` during the loop's execution. 

Since it is stated that `cnt` has been updated for `x` and that `i` is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]`, we can also infer that `arr[0]` must be a positive number for the square root to be defined and for `i` to have a meaningful comparison.

For the loop to execute the first time, it is essential that `cnt` contains at least one element. Thus, we can summarize the necessary conditions:

State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]`, `cnt` contains at least one count for `x`, `i` is greater than the square root of the initial value of `arr[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `cnt` is not empty, and `key` is the first element in `cnt`**
