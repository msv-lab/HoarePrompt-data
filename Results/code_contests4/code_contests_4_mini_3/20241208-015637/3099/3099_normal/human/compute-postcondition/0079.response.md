The value of `cnt[i]` is updated to be `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`, which means that if `i` is not already a key in the `cnt` dictionary, it will default to 0, and then 1 will be added to that value. Since `cnt[i]` is being updated, the previous value of `cnt[i]` is irrelevant for this operation. The other variable `x` remains unchanged in this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt[i]` is updated to be `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`; `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt[i]` is updated to be `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`; `x` remains unchanged**.
