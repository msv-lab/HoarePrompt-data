The `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`, which means it retrieves the current value of `cnt[i]`, and if `cnt[i]` does not exist, it defaults to 0. This value is then incremented by 1. The variable `x` and its state are not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect the updated state of `cnt[i]`, which is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 if it didn't exist before.

Output State: **`x` is the smallest multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1); `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1.**
