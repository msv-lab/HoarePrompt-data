The value of `x` is divided by `i`, where `i` is 2. Since `x` is at least 4, the new value of `x` will be at least 2. The values of `cnt` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is at least 4, `cnt` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]`, `i` is 2, and after the operation, `x` is at least 2.

Output State: **`x` is at least 2, `cnt` contains the count of the prime factors of the original value of `arr[2]`, `i` is 2**
