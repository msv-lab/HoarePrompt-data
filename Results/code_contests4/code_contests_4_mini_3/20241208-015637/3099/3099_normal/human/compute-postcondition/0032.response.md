To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop. The loop will execute as long as `x % i == 0`. 

1. **Understanding the variables**:
   - `x` is defined as the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]` divided by `i` raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed.
   - The condition `x % i == 0` means that `x` must be divisible by `i`.

2. **Current state**:
   - We know that `i` must be adjusted to ensure `x % i == 0` holds true.
   - The prompt states that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x` minus 1.

3. **Formulating the adjustment**:
   - If `i` is currently greater than the integer part of the square root of `x` minus 1, the loop cannot execute.
   - Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to set `i` to be a value that is less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x` minus 1.

Based on this analysis, the necessary states that need to be adjusted are centered around `i`.

State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]` divided by `i` raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed; for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x` minus 1.**
