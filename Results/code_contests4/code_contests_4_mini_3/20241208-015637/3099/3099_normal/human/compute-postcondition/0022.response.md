Output State: **`x` is the odd part of the initial value of `arr[0]` and `x` must be greater than or equal to 9; `i` is an odd divisor of `x`; `x` is now divided by `i`; `cnt[i]` is updated to `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`, which means `cnt[i]` is either 1 (if `i` was not in `cnt`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `cnt`).**
