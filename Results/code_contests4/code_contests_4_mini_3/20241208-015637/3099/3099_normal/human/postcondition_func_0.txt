The function accepts a positive integer `a` and a list `b` of `a` positive integers. It calculates `c` as the sum of `a` and the list `b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it reduces `c` by `mod` before returning it. If `c` is less than `mod`, it simply returns `c`. The function does not actually use the elements of the list `b` in the summation process, which may be a missing functionality depending on the intended use.
