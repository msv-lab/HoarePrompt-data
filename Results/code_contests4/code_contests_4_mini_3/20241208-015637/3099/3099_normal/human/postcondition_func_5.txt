The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer N followed by a list of N positive integers. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) based on the prime factorization of the integers in the list, and then processes this LCM with each integer in the list using a series of functions (func_1, func_2, and func_4) to produce a final result, which it prints. The function handles prime factor counts and ensures the LCM includes the maximum counts of each prime factor found across the integers. It also assumes valid input as per the constraints stated.
