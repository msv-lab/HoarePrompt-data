You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given are N positive integers A_1,...,A_N.

Consider positive integers B_1, ..., B_N that satisfy the following condition.

Condition: For any i, j such that 1 \leq i < j \leq N, A_i B_i = A_j B_j holds.

Find the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for such B_1,...,B_N.

Since the answer can be enormous, print the sum modulo (10^9 +7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^4
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
* All values in input are integers.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer N representing the number of elements, and b is a list of N positive integers A_1, ..., A_N such that 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer representing the number of elements, `b` is a list of N positive integers. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is decreased by `mod`. If `c` is less than `mod`, then `c` remains unchanged.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of c, which is either unchanged or decreased by mod depending on its previous value relative to mod.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `a` and a list `b` of `a` positive integers. It calculates `c` as the sum of `a` and the list `b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it reduces `c` by `mod` before returning it. If `c` is less than `mod`, it simply returns `c`. The function does not actually use the elements of the list `b` in the summation process, which may be a missing functionality depending on the intended use.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the number of elements, and b is a list of N positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= b[i] <= 10^6 for all i.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the product of the positive integer 'a' and the sum of the elements in the list 'b', modulo 'mod'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `a` and a list of positive integers `b`, returning the product of `a` and the sum of the elements in `b`, modulo `mod`. Note that the variable `mod` is not defined within the function, which could lead to a NameError if it is not defined in the surrounding scope. Additionally, there is no validation for the input parameters, so if `b` contains any non-positive integers or if `a` is not positive, the behavior is not specified.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer N (1 <= N <= 10^4) representing the number of positive integers, and b is a list of N positive integers A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^6).
def func_3(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer value 1
    else :
        if (b % 2 == 1) :
            return func_2(a, func_3(a, b - 1))
            #The program returns the result of func_2, which takes `a` and the result of func_3 applied to `a` and `b - 1`, where `b` is a list of N positive integers with its last element being an odd integer.
        else :
            temp = func_3(a, b / 2)
            return func_2(temp, temp)
            #The program returns the result of func_2 with the same value 'temp' passed as both arguments, where 'temp' is the result of func_3(a, b / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `a` and a list `b` of positive integers. It returns 1 if `b` is 0; otherwise, it evaluates the last element of `b`. If the last element is odd, it returns the result of `func_2` with `a` and the result of `func_3` called with `b - 1`. If the last element is even, it calculates `temp` as the result of `func_3` called with `b / 2` and then returns `func_2` with `temp` passed as both arguments. Note that `b` should be treated as an integer rather than a list when checking for zero and when performing arithmetic operations, which may lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of N positive integers where 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for each A_i in a.
def func_4(a):
    return func_3(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of func_3 applied to the list 'a' of N positive integers and the value 'mod - 2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of N positive integers `a`, where 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and returns the result of `func_3` applied to `a` and the value `mod - 2`. The functionality of `func_3` is not defined here, so the exact output depends on its implementation. There are no additional checks or error handling in this function, such as validating the contents of `a` or ensuring that `mod` is defined within this context.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of N positive integers where 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for all valid indices i; m is the modulo value set to (10^9 + 7).
def func_5(a, m):
    m0 = m
    y = 0
    x = 1
    if (m == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of N positive integers where 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for all valid indices i; `m` is (10^9 + 7); `m0` is (10^9 + 7); `y` is 0; `x` is 1; `m` is not equal to 1.
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        
        t = m
        
        m = a % m
        
        a = t
        
        t = y
        
        y = x - q * y
        
        x = t
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `m` is 0, `m0` is (10^9 + 7), `y` is undefined, `x` is undefined, due to the final value of `a` being 0 the loop terminates and avoids further execution.
    if (x < 0) :
        x = x + m0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is 0, `m` is 0, `m0` is 1000000007. If `x` is less than 0, `x` is either undefined or a positive number greater than 1000000007. No further execution occurs due to the termination of the loop.
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is either undefined or a positive number greater than 1000000007
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a modulo value `m`. It returns 0 if `m` is equal to 1. Otherwise, it performs a series of calculations, ultimately returning a value `x` which can be negative or greater than `m0` (10^9 + 7). The function may not handle all edge cases properly, as it can result in an undefined behavior for `y` and `x` if the loop does not execute as expected.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4, and A is a list of N positive integers where each A[i] satisfies 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6.
def func_6():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    answer = {}
    for i in range(n):
        cnt = {}
        
        x = arr[i]
        
        i = 2
        
        while i * i <= x:
            while x % i == 0:
                x /= i
                cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1
            i += 1
        
        if x != 1:
            cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        for key in cnt:
            answer[key] = max(answer.get(key, 0), cnt[key])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is 1 or less, `cnt` contains prime factors of the last element of `arr` with their respective counts, `answer` contains the maximum counts of each prime factor across all elements of `arr`.
    lcm = 1
    for prime in answer:
        for _ in range(answer[prime]):
            lcm = func_2(lcm, prime)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is 1 or less, `cnt` contains prime factors of the last element of `arr` with their respective counts, `answer` contains the maximum counts of each prime factor across all elements of `arr`, `lcm` is the least common multiple based on the prime factors from `answer`.
    ans = 0
    for x in arr:
        ans = func_1(ans, func_2(lcm, func_4(x)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is updated to the result of `func_1` applied to the final value of `ans` and the result of `func_2(lcm, func_4(x))`, `arr` is a list of elements processed through the loop.
    ans = int(ans)
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer N followed by a list of N positive integers. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) based on the prime factorization of the integers in the list, and then processes this LCM with each integer in the list using a series of functions (func_1, func_2, and func_4) to produce a final result, which it prints. The function handles prime factor counts and ensures the LCM includes the maximum counts of each prime factor found across the integers. It also assumes valid input as per the constraints stated.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
