The function accepts an integer `a` and a list `b` of positive integers. It returns 1 if `b` is 0; otherwise, it evaluates the last element of `b`. If the last element is odd, it returns the result of `func_2` with `a` and the result of `func_3` called with `b - 1`. If the last element is even, it calculates `temp` as the result of `func_3` called with `b / 2` and then returns `func_2` with `temp` passed as both arguments. Note that `b` should be treated as an integer rather than a list when checking for zero and when performing arithmetic operations, which may lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
