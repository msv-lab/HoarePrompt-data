To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly calculates the area of a star based on the given parameters (number of corners, `n`, and radius, `r`).

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers, `n` and `r`, which represent the number of corners of the star (where `n` is prime and `n >= 5`) and the radius of the circumcircle (`1 <= r <= 10^9`). This matches the problem description.

2. **Mathematical Calculation**:
   - The area of the star is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{n \cdot r^2 \cdot \sin(\frac{\pi}{2n}) \cdot \sin(\frac{\pi}{n})}{\sin(\frac{3\pi}{2n})}
     \]
   - The program implements this formula correctly in the line:
     ```python
     ans = float(n * r * r * math.sin(pi / (2 * n)) * math.sin(pi / n) / math.sin(3 * pi / (2 * n)))
     ```
   - This matches the requirement of the problem description to calculate the area of the star.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated area, which is exactly what is required by the problem description.

4. **Precision**:
   - The problem description states that the relative error should not be greater than \(10^{-7}\). The calculations using Python's `math` module (which uses floating-point arithmetic) are sufficient to ensure that the precision is maintained within the acceptable limits for this problem.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - With the input constraints provided (specifying `n` as a prime number and `r` within the set limits), the program will operate correctly for any valid inputs as per the description.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the program implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description without any deviations or errors.

Correctness: **True**
