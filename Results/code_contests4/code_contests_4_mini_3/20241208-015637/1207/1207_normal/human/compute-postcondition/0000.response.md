The values of `n` and `r` are both assigned from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The previous state indicates that `n` is a prime integer within the range 5 ≤ n < 10^9, and `r` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `r` will be replaced by the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is replaced by a prime integer from input; `r` is replaced by an integer from input**
