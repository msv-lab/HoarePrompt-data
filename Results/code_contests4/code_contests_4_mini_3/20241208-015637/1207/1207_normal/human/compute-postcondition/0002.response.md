The variable `ans` is assigned a complex expression involving the variables `n`, `r`, and `pi`. The values of `n` and `r` are prime integer and integer inputs respectively, while `pi` is a constant with the value of 3.141592653589793. The calculation involves the sine function applied to various fractions of `pi`, which will yield a specific float value for `ans`. However, since the specific values of `n` and `r` are not provided, we cannot calculate an exact numerical output for `ans`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationships and calculations made with the variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is a prime integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, `pi` is 3.141592653589793; `ans` is calculated as float(n * r * r * math.sin(pi / (2 * n)) * math.sin(pi / n) / math.sin(3 * pi / (2 * n)))**
