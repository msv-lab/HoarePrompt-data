To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the impact of the print statement on the program.

1. The variable `ans` is calculated using the formula provided. Since `n` is a prime integer from input, and `r` is also an integer from input, the specific values of `n` and `r` will determine the ultimate value of `ans`. The value of `pi` has been defined as 3.141592653589793.

2. The output of the `print(ans)` statement will display the calculated value of `ans`, but since the actual values of `n` and `r` are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of `n` and `r`.

3. The output state after executing the code will reflect that `ans` has been calculated based on the formula and is printed out.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a prime integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, `pi` is 3.141592653589793; `ans` is calculated and printed based on the formula provided.**
