The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by the absence of parameters in the function definition. However, based on the provided constraints, `n` is a prime integer such that \( 5 \leq n < 10^9 \), and `r` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^9 \). 

Since the output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, we can summarize that the function potentially processes these two variables `n` and `r` in some manner. Without specific output details, we can only describe the constraints of `n` and `r`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but it utilizes a prime integer n (5 ≤ n < 10^9) and an integer r (1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9) in its operations. The specific return value is not provided.**
