The code assigns a constant value to the variable `pi`, which does not depend on the values of `n` or `r`. Since `n` and `r` are replaced by integers from input, their values remain unchanged by this line. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a prime integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, and `pi` is 3.141592653589793.

Output State: **`n` is a prime integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, `pi` is 3.141592653589793**
