Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, a prime integer `n` (where 5 ≤ n < 10^9) and an integer `r` (where 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9), from input and calculates a mathematical expression involving these values. It then prints the result of the calculation as a floating-point number. The function does not return a value, as the output is printed directly. There are no explicit checks for invalid input or handling for edge cases in the calculation. **
