#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000, and NUMBERS is a list of n - 1 distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to N.
def func_1(N, NUMBERS):
    n = int(N)
    numbers = [int(s) for s in NUMBERS.split(' ')]
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `numbers`, and `numbers` is a list of integers.
    sys.stdout.write(str(int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` (where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and a string `NUMBERS` representing a list of `N - 1` distinct integers in the range from 1 to N. It calculates the sum of the integers provided in `NUMBERS`, and then it outputs the missing integer from the range 1 to N that is not included in the list. The function does not return a value; instead, it writes the missing number directly to standard output.
