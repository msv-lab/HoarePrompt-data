The function accepts an integer `N` (where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and a string `NUMBERS` representing a list of `N - 1` distinct integers in the range from 1 to N. It calculates the sum of the integers provided in `NUMBERS`, and then it outputs the missing integer from the range 1 to N that is not included in the list. The function does not return a value; instead, it writes the missing number directly to standard output.
