According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list contains at least one integer, the loop will execute. Given that `n` is equal to `N` and `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, we can assume that `numbers` should contain at least one integer derived from the string `NUMBERS`. 

At the start of the loop, `sum` is initialized to 0, but this does not affect the ability for the loop to execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `numbers` list must have at least one integer.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the string `NUMBERS` with at least 1 integer**.
