The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(N)`. Since `N` is already an integer, `n` will have the same value as `N`. The other variables (`NUMBERS`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is equal to `N`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is equal to `N**
