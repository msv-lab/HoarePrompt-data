The value of `sum` is increased by `num`, but the specific values of `sum` and `num` are not provided. The previous state indicates that `N` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100000, and `n` is equal to `N`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `numbers` must have at least one more element, which is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `sum` due to the addition of `num`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is increased by `num`.**
