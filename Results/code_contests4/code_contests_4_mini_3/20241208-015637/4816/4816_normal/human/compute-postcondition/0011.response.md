The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `N` and `NUMBERS`. `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000. `NUMBERS` is a list of n - 1 distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to N. After executing the function body, it returns an integer representing the missing number from the sequence of integers from 1 to N. The missing number is the only integer in that range that is not included in `NUMBERS`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N and a list of distinct integers NUMBERS, and returns the missing integer from the range 1 to N that is not present in NUMBERS.**
