The value of `sum` is increased by `num`. The previous values indicate that `sum` was already increased by `num` in a loop, and since `numbers` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again, we can confirm that `num` holds the next element. However, the exact values of `sum` and `num` are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is increased by `num`, and `numbers` must have at least one more element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is increased by `num`, and `numbers` must have at least one more element.**
