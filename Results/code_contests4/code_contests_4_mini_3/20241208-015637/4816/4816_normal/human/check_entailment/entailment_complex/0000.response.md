Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here’s a detailed explanation of why the program meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two inputs: an integer `N` which represents the total number of episodes (with constraints 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000), and a string `NUMBERS` which contains `N - 1` distinct integers (the episodes that have been watched). The program correctly parses these inputs.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the sum of the watched episodes from the list `numbers`. This is done using a loop that iterates over each number and accumulates their sum in the variable `sum`. This correctly reflects the requirement to determine which episode is missing.

3. **Finding the Missing Episode**: The program calculates the expected sum of the first `N` natural numbers using the formula \( \frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} \). This formula accurately gives the total sum of episode numbers from 1 to N. By subtracting the sum of the watched episodes from this expected sum, the program effectively identifies the missing episode.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the missing episode number directly to standard output, which aligns with the problem description.

Thus, the function implements the required logic to find the missing episode number correctly for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios that would cause it to fail based on the provided specifications. Hence, the program is correct.
