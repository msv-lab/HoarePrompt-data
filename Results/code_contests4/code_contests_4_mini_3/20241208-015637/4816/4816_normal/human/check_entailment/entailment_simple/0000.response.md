To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. There are `n` episodes in total, numbered from `1` to `n`.
2. Polycarpus has watched `n - 1` episodes, and these episodes are distinct integers within the range `1` to `n`.
3. The output should be the single episode number that has not been watched.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
- The function `func_1(N, NUMBERS)` takes:
  - `N`: an integer representing the total number of episodes.
  - `NUMBERS`: a space-separated string of `n - 1` integers that represent the episodes that have been watched.

- The main steps executed in the function are:
  1. Convert `N` to an integer.
  2. Convert `NUMBERS` from a string to a list of integers.
  3. Calculate the sum of the watched episodes.
  4. Calculate the expected sum of all episode numbers from `1` to `n` using the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
  5. The unwatched episode is then determined by subtracting the sum of watched episodes from the expected total sum.
  6. The result is printed.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Input Constraints**: The function correctly handles the constraints provided (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
2. **Distinctness**: The program does not explicitly enforce or check for distinctness of the episodes in the input, but it assumes that the input follows the problem description.
3. **Logic for Finding the Unwatched Episode**: 
   - The calculation \( n(n + 1)/2 \) correctly calculates the total sum of all episodes.
   - The subtraction of the sum of watched episodes from this total sum correctly identifies the missing episode.
  
4. **Output Format**: The function writes the result correctly in the expected format.

### Conclusion:
The implementation of the function aligns with the problem description. It correctly computes the unwatched episode number based on the input provided. Given all the checks, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
