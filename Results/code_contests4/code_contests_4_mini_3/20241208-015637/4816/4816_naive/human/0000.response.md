To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
Polycarpus watches episodes of a season of a sitcom and has forgotten to watch one. Given the total number of episodes `n` and a list of `n-1` watched episodes, the task is to identify the one episode he hasn't watched.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(N, NUMBERS):
    n = int(N)
    numbers = [int(s) for s in NUMBERS.split(' ')]
    assert n + 0 == len(numbers) + 1
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
    sys.stdout.write(str(int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)) + '\n')
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `N` (the total number of episodes) and `NUMBERS` (the watched episodes as a string).
   - It converts `N` to an integer and splits the `NUMBERS` string into a list of integers.

2. **Assertion**:
   - The assertion `assert n + 0 == len(numbers) + 1` checks that the number of watched episodes is indeed `n - 1`. If this condition fails, the program will raise an assertion error, which is a good way to ensure input validity.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the watched episodes.

4. **Finding the Missing Episode**:
   - It uses the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, `n * (n + 1) / 2`, and subtracts the sum of the watched episodes from it to find the missing episode.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Values**:
   - If `n = 2`, the only watched episode could be either `1` or `2`. The program must handle this correctly, which it does, as the sum calculation and the formula will yield the correct missing episode.

2. **Maximum Input Values**:
   - If `n = 100000`, it should still perform efficiently without running into integer overflow issues, which Python handles well.

3. **Invalid Input**:
   - The program does not handle invalid inputs gracefully since it makes an assertion. If `NUMBERS` doesn't have exactly `n - 1` episodes, it will raise an error.

4. **Performance**:
   - The approach is efficient, involving a single pass to sum the episodes and a constant time calculation for the expected sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the missing episode based on the provided problem description. It handles the valid input case correctly and efficiently, and it adheres to the constraints. The lack of error handling for invalid inputs is noted, but since the assertion checks for validity, it is reasonable to assume that valid input is provided in the context of competitive programming.

Given all the analysis and the fact that it works correctly for all potential valid cases, the program meets the correctness criteria.

Correctness: **True**.
