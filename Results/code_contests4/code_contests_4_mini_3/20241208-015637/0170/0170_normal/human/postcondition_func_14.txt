The function accepts an integer `x`, an integer `y`, and a list of three lists `p`, and returns the result of the exponentiation by squaring process based on the values of `x` and `y`, reduced modulo the integer value derived from the lists in `p`. Note that the function does not use the contents of `p` for any calculations other than the modulo operation, which may not accurately reflect the intended use of the input. Additionally, the function assumes `x` is initially reduced by some undefined `p` value, which could lead to unexpected results if `p` does not contain a singular integer.
