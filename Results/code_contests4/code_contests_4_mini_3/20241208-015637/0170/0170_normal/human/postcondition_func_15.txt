The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0 at the start, the function will return the initial value of `x`. The function assumes valid input within specified bounds, but does not handle cases where `y` could be less than 1, which is outside the stated constraints.
