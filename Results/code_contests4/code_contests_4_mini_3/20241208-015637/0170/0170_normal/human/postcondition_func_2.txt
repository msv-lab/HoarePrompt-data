The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object of integers obtained from space-separated input values. These integers are converted from string format to integer format. Each integer is expected to be within the range of 1 to 100, but there is no explicit error handling for cases where the input may not meet the conditions. The function does not validate the input or ensure that the integers are distinct among the lists mentioned in the annotations.
