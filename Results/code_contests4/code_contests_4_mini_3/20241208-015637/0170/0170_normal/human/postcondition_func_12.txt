The function accepts an integer `n` in the range [3, 100] and an integer `r` that should be chosen from one of the sequences contained in the list `r`. It returns the result of the binomial coefficient calculation using the formula factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1))). However, there is no validation in the code to ensure that `r` is within the valid range of integers for the sequences, which could lead to errors if `r` is outside the expected range. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `r` could be negative or greater than `n`, which would also cause computation issues.
