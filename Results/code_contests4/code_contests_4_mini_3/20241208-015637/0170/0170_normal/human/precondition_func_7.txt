l is a list containing multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four lines: the first line is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), the third line is a list of n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100), and the fourth line is a list of n integers c_1, c_2, …, c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). For all i in the range [0, n-1], a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.
