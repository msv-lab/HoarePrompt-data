t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100. The sequences a, b, and c are lists of integers where each list has n integers and for each index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), a_i, b_i, and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100, and a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.
