The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, and an integer `num`. It returns a list of lists with dimensions `n x m`, where each inner list contains the integer `num` repeated `m` times. There are no checks for the validity of `n`, `m`, or `num`, so it assumes they are provided as specified in the annotations.
