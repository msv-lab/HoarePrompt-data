The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` containing three tuples of integers. It returns the integer result of dividing `x` by the length of `y` (which is always 3), returning `x // 3` if `x` is divisible by 3, or `x // 3 + 1` if not. The function does not properly handle edge cases where `y` might not contain exactly three tuples, leading to potential incorrect behavior.
