x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and for each test case, y is a list of three tuples, each containing n integers (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) where the integers are in the range 1 to 100, and each tuple represents the sequences a, b, and c respectively, with the condition that no two integers in the same position of the tuples are equal.
