The function accepts an integer `n` between 3 and 100 and returns a list of integers representing each digit of `n`. If `n` is a single-digit number, it returns a list containing that single digit; if `n` is a two-digit number, it returns a list of the two digits. The function does not perform any additional validation beyond the stated constraints.
