The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and checks various conditions to determine if `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3 (but greater than 1), or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If `n` passes these checks, it further checks divisibility by numbers starting from 5, increasing by 6 each time, up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is found to be divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`. If all checks are passed, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not evaluate sequences `a`, `b`, and `c` as described in the annotations—this aspect is not implemented in the code.
