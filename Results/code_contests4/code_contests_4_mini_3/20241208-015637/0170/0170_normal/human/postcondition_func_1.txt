The function accepts input data which includes the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it expects to handle integer sequences `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i`. However, the function only reads and returns the input data without processing or validating the sequences according to the specified constraints on their values. It does not handle the integers `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i` explicitly within the function, nor does it check if the constraints (distinctness and range) are satisfied. Therefore, the functionality is limited to returning the raw input without any additional checks.
