x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), y is an integer representing the number of elements in the sequences (3 ≤ y ≤ 100), and p is a list of three lists, each containing y integers (1 ≤ p[i][j] ≤ 100) such that for each i (0 ≤ i < y), p[0][i] ≠ p[1][i], p[0][i] ≠ p[2][i], and p[1][i] ≠ p[2][i].
