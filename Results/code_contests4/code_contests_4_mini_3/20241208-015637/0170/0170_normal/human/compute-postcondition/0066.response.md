The variable `c` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are the results of separate calls to `func_5()`, but the specific values returned by `func_5()` are unknown. Therefore, `c` will be a new value from another call to `func_5()`, which is also unknown. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ans`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()` which is greater than the number of iterations already executed; `ans` is a list of length `n` with values from `a`, `b`, and `c`; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `c` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`**.
