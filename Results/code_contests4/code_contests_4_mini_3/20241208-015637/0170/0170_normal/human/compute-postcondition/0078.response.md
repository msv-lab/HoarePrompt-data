Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is a list of length `n`, and `i` is 1. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` is updated to `b[i]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.***
