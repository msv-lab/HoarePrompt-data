According to the code, the loop iterates over the `args` variable. The loop can execute again if there are more items in `args` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, which indicates that the loop has already started iterating. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` must be the next item in `args`. 

If we denote the current iteration index as `current_index`, the next iteration will involve `current_index + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have more items beyond the current index.

State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute again `args` must have more items, and `x` will be the next item in `args` with index `current_index + 1`**
