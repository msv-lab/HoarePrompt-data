To analyze the given code snippet, we need to take into account the previous values of the affected variables and how the code modifies them.

1. `ans` is a list initialized with zeros, and its length is `n`.
2. The previous assignments indicate that `a`, `b`, and `c` are lists (or arrays) returned by `func_5`, and their lengths must be at least `n` since we are assigning `ans[i] = c[i]`.
3. The code assigns `c[i]` to `ans[i]`. 

Since `i` is initialized to 1, `ans[1]` will be assigned the value of `c[1]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ans`, specifically its second element, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with 0s, `a` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `b` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `c` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, the value of `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, the value of `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.**
