The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates on predefined input constraints where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an integer indicating the size of the sequences. The sequences `a`, `b`, and `c` are lists of integers of size `n`, where each element meets specific criteria regarding their values and uniqueness among the lists.

The function's output will depend on the logic applied to the sequences `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the given constraints. However, specific return values or conditions under which the function outputs results are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but processes predefined input constraints for `t`, `n`, and lists `a`, `b`, and `c` to produce a result based on the logic applied to these inputs.**
