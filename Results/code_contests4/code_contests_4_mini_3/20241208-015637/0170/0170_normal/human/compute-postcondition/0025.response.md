Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and prints provided arguments to a specified output stream, separating them with a defined separator. The first argument is printed without a separator, and it can append an optional ending string. If the 'flush' keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output stream. The function does not handle any test case logic or constraints, as suggested by the annotations. **
