The variable `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The value of `b` is now determined by the output of `func_5()`, but since `func_5()` is not executed in the provided context, we can't specify the exact value of `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()` which is greater than the number of iterations already executed; `ans` is a list of length `n` with values from `a`, `b`, and `c`; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`.
