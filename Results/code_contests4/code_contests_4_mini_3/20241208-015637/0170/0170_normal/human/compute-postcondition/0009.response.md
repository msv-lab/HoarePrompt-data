According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args`. If `args` contains more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, indicating that we are not at the start of the loop. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to refer to the next element in `args`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `args` beyond the current position of `x`. 

State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute again `args` must have at least one more element, and `x` is the next element in `args`.**
