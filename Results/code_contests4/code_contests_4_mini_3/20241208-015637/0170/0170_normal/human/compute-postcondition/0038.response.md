According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and runs until `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because if `n` is 1, the loop will not run at all. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` will be initialized to 1. 

So, for the loop to be executed the first time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is now 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with 0s, `a` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `b` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `c` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]**
