Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[2]` is equal to `b[2]`. Otherwise, `ans[2]` is assigned the value of `c[2]`.***
