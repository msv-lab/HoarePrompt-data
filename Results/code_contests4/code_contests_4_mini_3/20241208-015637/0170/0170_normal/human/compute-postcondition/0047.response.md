Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `a[1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, and if `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.***
