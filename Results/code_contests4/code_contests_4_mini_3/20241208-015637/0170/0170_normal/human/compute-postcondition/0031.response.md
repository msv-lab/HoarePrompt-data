According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range provided by `func_1()` returns a positive integer. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `n` is greater than 0, meaning `func_1()` must also return a positive integer for the loop to execute again. Since the loop variable is represented by an underscore (`_`), it does not affect the state. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a list of length `n`. This suggests that for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` needs to return a value indicating that it can iterate again.

To summarize, for the loop to execute again, the conditions remain the same as they were in the previous state, and the `func_1()` function needs to return a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of length `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `func_1()` must return a positive integer.**
