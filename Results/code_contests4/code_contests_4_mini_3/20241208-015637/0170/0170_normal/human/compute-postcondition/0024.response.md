The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of integers `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i` according to the specified constraints. 

The function returns results based on the input values, but the specific output is not provided in the description. However, we can infer that it involves processing the integers for each test case and returning some computed results based on the logic defined within the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes multiple test cases, returning results based on the given constraints for each test case.**
