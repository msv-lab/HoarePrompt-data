According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and runs while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, meaning the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute once more, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which now is 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`**
