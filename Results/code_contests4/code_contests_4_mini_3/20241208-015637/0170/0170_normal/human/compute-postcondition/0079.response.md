According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues until `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Given that `n` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. In terms of the list `ans`, after checking `ans[0]`, the next value `ans[1]` will be updated based on the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now 2 and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is 2**
