According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making it 3. Additionally, since `n` is greater than 1, it must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is a list of length `n`, and `i` is 3.**
