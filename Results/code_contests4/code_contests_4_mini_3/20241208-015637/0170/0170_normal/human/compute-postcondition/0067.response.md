The code `ans = [0] * n` initializes the list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` is already assigned and is greater than the number of iterations already executed. The previous states of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not affect the initialization of `ans`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `c` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`**.
