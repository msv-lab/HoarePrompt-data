The code specifies that it assigns values to the variables `sep` and `file` from the keyword arguments `kwargs`. It retrieves the value for `sep`, defaulting to a space `' '` if not provided, and retrieves the value for `file`, defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not provided. Since this code does not modify any of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, or `c_i`, and only handles the keyword arguments, the output state focuses on the new variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer for each test case such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a_i`, `b_i`, `c_i` are integers for each `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`) with 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i`, `c_i` ≤ 100, where `a_i` ≠ `b_i`, `a_i` ≠ `c_i`, and `b_i` ≠ `c_i`; `sep` is either the provided separator or ' '; `file` is either the provided file or `sys.stdout`.**
