To determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time, we first analyze the provided information.

1. The loop is controlled by `func_1()`, which returns a certain number of iterations. We need to know the current iteration count and the value returned by `func_1()` to understand how many times the loop has executed and how many times it can execute again.
  
2. The current state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `t` is within the range of 1 to 100, `n` is a positive integer, and `ans` is a list with `n` elements, ensuring no two consecutive elements are the same. The function `func_20` has been called with `ans`, but we do not have the result of `func_1()` or the current iteration count.

Given that we don't have specific information about how many times the loop has executed or the current state of the loop variable, we can only infer that for the loop to execute one more time, the following states must be adjusted:

- The loop will execute again if `func_1()` returns a value greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred.
- The value of `_` (the loop variable) should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, assuming the loop has executed `k` times already, we can conclude:

- The next value for `_` would be `k + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact values here, we summarize the necessary state adjustments.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is a list of length `n` with values from `a`, `b`, and `c`, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than the number of iterations already executed.**
