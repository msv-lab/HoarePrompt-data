Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is a list of length `n`, and `i` is 3. If `ans[2]` is not equal to `a[3]`, then `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `a[3]`. If `ans[2]` is equal to `b[3]`, then `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `b[3]`; otherwise, `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `c[3]`.***
