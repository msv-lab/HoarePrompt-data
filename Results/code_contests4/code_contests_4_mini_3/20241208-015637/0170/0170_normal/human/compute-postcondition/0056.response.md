The value of `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 3, so `ans[3]` will take the value of `b[3]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ans`, and `a`) remain unchanged, but we do not have the specific value of `b[3]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, and `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `b[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `b[3]`.**
