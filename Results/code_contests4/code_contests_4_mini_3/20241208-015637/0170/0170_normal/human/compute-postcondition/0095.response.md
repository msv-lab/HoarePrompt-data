Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases where for each test case it reads an integer `n` and three lists `a`, `b`, and `c`, each containing `n` integers. It constructs a new list `ans` where each element is taken from `a`, `b`, or `c`, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in `ans` are the same. The function then calls `func_20` with the constructed `ans` list for each test case. It does not accept parameters directly but relies on predefined input constraints. **
