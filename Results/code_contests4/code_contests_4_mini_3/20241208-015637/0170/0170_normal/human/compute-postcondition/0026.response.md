`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not directly affected by this assignment, but we need to note the context. Given that `i` is 3, `ans[3]` will take the value of `c[3]`. Since `c[i]` exists and is indexed by `i`, we can assume `c` has at least 4 elements (0 to 3). Therefore, we can't determine the specific values of `ans[i]` or `c[i]` without knowing `c`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `c[3]`.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `c[3]`.**
