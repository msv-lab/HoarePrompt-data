The value of `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is 2 and `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, the value of `ans[2]` will become equal to `a[2]`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `b`, `c` are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `ans[2]` is equal to `a[2]`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`**
