According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`.**
