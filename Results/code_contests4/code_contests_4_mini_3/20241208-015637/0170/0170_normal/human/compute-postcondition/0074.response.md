The code `ans[i] = b[i]` assigns the value of `b[i]` to `ans[i]`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, so this operation will affect `ans[1]`. The previous value of `ans[i - 1]`, which is `ans[0]`, is equal to `a[i]`, and it is noted that `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`.

Since `i` is 1, the assignment will specifically update `ans[1]` with the value from `b[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected in this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[i - 1]` equal to `a[i]`, `ans[i - 1]` not equal to `b[i]`, and `ans[i]` is now equal to `b[i]`.**
