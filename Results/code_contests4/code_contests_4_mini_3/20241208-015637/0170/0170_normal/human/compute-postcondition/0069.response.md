According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since the range starts at 1). Given that `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to begin executing. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 1, as that is the starting point of the `range(1, n)`. The other variables `t`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute but should be recognized as part of the overall program state.

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 and `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is 1**
