The value of `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `ans[1]` will be assigned the value of `a[1]`. The previous state of `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with 0s, so `ans[0]` was already assigned the value of `a[0]`, but `ans[1]` is currently 0 before this assignment. 

The condition that `ans[i - 1]` (which is `ans[0]`) is not equal to `a[i]` implies that the assignment will occur without any issues. 

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, and `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `a[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `a[1]`.**
