Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is assigned based on the conditions checking previous values of `ans` and the corresponding values in `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, `ans[0]` is `a[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, or `c[i]` based on the conditions relative to `ans[i - 1]`.**
