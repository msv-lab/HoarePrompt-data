Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with 0s, `a` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `b` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `c` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, the value of `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, and `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`.***
