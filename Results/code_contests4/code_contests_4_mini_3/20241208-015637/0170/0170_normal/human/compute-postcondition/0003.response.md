According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `args` variable. For the loop to execute, `args` must be a collection (like a list or tuple) that contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is True, which indicates that the loop has not yet executed. Therefore, for the loop to be executed for the first time, `args` must contain at least one element, and `x` will take the value of the first element in `args`.

State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a collection with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`**
