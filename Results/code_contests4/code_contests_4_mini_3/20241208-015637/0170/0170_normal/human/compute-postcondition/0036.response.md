The code initializes the variable `ans` as a list with `n` elements, all set to 0. The previous values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of the `ans` list based on its initialization.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is assigned a positive integer; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with 0s; `a` is assigned a value returned by `func_5`; `b` is assigned a value returned by `func_5(); `c` is assigned a value returned by `func_5()`**
