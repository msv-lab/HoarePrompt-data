The value of `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 2, so `ans[2]` is updated to be equal to `b[2]`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ans`, `a`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, and `ans[2]` is now equal to `b[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have values returned by `func_5`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans[2]` is equal to `b[2]**
