The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters directly but expects to read from a file named 'input.txt' and writes the output to a file named 'output.txt'. The expected input format is defined by the context, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100, and lists `a`, `b`, `c` must each contain `n` integers between 1 and 100, ensuring the elements of these lists are distinct at each index. However, the function does not process or validate this input data in any way, making it limited in functionality to simply handling file input/output.
