Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

One key issue arises in the loop where the `ans` list is constructed. Specifically, consider the logic within the loop that populates `ans`:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if ans[i - 1] != a[i]:
        ans[i] = a[i]
    elif ans[i - 1] != b[i]:
        ans[i] = b[i]
    else:
        ans[i] = c[i]
```

This logic fails to consider the case where the last element of `ans` (i.e., `ans[n-1]`) must not be equal to the first element (`ans[0]`). The problem states that `p_i ≠ p_{(i mod n) + 1}`, which means that the first and last elements of the sequence must also be different.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
1 2 1
2 1 2
3 3 3
```

In this case, the program would produce an output like `1 2 1`, which violates the requirement that `p_1 ≠ p_3` (1 is equal to 1).

Thus, the program fails to produce a valid sequence for this input, which demonstrates that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is false.
