You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three sequences: a_1, a_2, …, a_n; b_1, b_2, …, b_n; c_1, c_2, …, c_n.

For each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.

Find a sequence p_1, p_2, …, p_n, that satisfy the following conditions:

  * p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}
  * p_i ≠ p_{(i mod n) + 1}.



In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements i,i+1 adjacent for i<n and also elements 1 and n) will have equal value.

It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100): the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100): the number of elements in the given sequences.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains n integers c_1, c_2, …, c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.

Output

For each test case, print n integers: p_1, p_2, …, p_n (p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}, p_i ≠ p_{i mod n + 1}).

If there are several solutions, you can print any.

1 2 1 2
1 3 4 3 2 4 2
1 3 2
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2

Note

In the first test case p = [1, 2, 3].

It is a correct answer, because:

  * p_1 = 1 = a_1, p_2 = 2 = b_2, p_3 = 3 = c_3 
  * p_1 ≠ p_2 , p_2 ≠ p_3 , p_3 ≠ p_1 



All possible correct answers to this test case are: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].

In the second test case p = [1, 2, 1, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = a_3, p_4 = a_4. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.

In the third test case p = [1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = b_3, p_4 = b_4, p_5 = b_5, p_6 = c_6, p_7 = c_7. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value that is provided as input by the user. It does not handle any exceptions or validate the input range, so if the user enters a non-integer value, it will raise a ValueError.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts input data which includes the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it expects to handle integer sequences `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i`. However, the function only reads and returns the input data without processing or validating the sequences according to the specified constraints on their values. It does not handle the integers `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i` explicitly within the function, nor does it check if the constraints (distinctness and range) are satisfied. Therefore, the functionality is limited to returning the raw input without any additional checks.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object of integers obtained from space-separated input values. These integers are converted from string format to integer format. Each integer is expected to be within the range of 1 to 100, but there is no explicit error handling for cases where the input may not meet the conditions. The function does not validate the input or ensure that the integers are distinct among the lists mentioned in the annotations.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object that converts a space-separated string of input values into strings, after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. However, it relies on user input and does not handle any potential errors or edge cases that may arise from invalid input.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. The contents of the list are based on integer constraints defined for test cases that involve integers `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i` which are not explicitly passed to `func_5` but are instead presumably defined in the broader scope of the program.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` initializes a new thread to execute the `main` function, but it does not accept any parameters directly. It sets the recursion limit and stack size for the thread, which may be necessary for handling deep recursive calls or large data in the `main` function. However, without the implementation of `main`, the specific output or behavior based on the lists `a`, `b`, and `c` is not defined in this code. Therefore, the function primarily serves as a setup for threading without providing direct functionality on its own.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a tuple `item` containing three sequences of integers (a, b, c) and returns the second sequence of integers `b`. It does not perform any validation on the contents of the tuple or the sequences, assuming they adhere to the conditions specified in the preconditions.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list `l` containing multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four lines of data as specified. It returns the list `l` sorted in descending order based on the values determined by the function `getKey`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, and an integer `num`. It returns a list of lists with dimensions `n x m`, where each inner list contains the integer `num` repeated `m` times. There are no checks for the validity of `n`, `m`, or `num`, so it assumes they are provided as specified in the annotations.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three sequences of integers. It returns the list of tuples `x` along with the result of the boolean expression `x and not (x & (x - 1))`, which checks if `x` is non-empty and if `x` has a single bit set in its binary representation, yielding either `True` or `False`. However, this boolean operation does not have a meaningful interpretation with a list of tuples, and it may not behave as expected for the intended context.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. It does not handle any edge cases since the input is assumed to be valid within the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 100).
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts an integer `n` between 3 and 100 and returns a list of integers representing each digit of `n`. If `n` is a single-digit number, it returns a list containing that single digit; if `n` is a two-digit number, it returns a list of the two digits. The function does not perform any additional validation beyond the stated constraints.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts an integer `n` in the range [3, 100] and an integer `r` that should be chosen from one of the sequences contained in the list `r`. It returns the result of the binomial coefficient calculation using the formula factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1))). However, there is no validation in the code to ensure that `r` is within the valid range of integers for the sequences, which could lead to errors if `r` is outside the expected range. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `r` could be negative or greater than `n`, which would also cause computation issues.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` containing three tuples of integers. It returns the integer result of dividing `x` by the length of `y` (which is always 3), returning `x // 3` if `x` is divisible by 3, or `x // 3 + 1` if not. The function does not properly handle edge cases where `y` might not contain exactly three tuples, leading to potential incorrect behavior.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts an integer `x`, an integer `y`, and a list of three lists `p`, and returns the result of the exponentiation by squaring process based on the values of `x` and `y`, reduced modulo the integer value derived from the lists in `p`. Note that the function does not use the contents of `p` for any calculations other than the modulo operation, which may not accurately reflect the intended use of the input. Additionally, the function assumes `x` is initially reduced by some undefined `p` value, which could lead to unexpected results if `p` does not contain a singular integer.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0 at the start, the function will return the initial value of `x`. The function assumes valid input within specified bounds, but does not handle cases where `y` could be less than 1, which is outside the stated constraints.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and checks various conditions to determine if `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3 (but greater than 1), or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If `n` passes these checks, it further checks divisibility by numbers starting from 5, increasing by 6 each time, up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is found to be divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`. If all checks are passed, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not evaluate sequences `a`, `b`, and `c` as described in the annotations—this aspect is not implemented in the code.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters directly but expects to read from a file named 'input.txt' and writes the output to a file named 'output.txt'. The expected input format is defined by the context, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100, and lists `a`, `b`, `c` must each contain `n` integers between 1 and 100, ensuring the elements of these lists are distinct at each index. However, the function does not process or validate this input data in any way, making it limited in functionality to simply handling file input/output.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        n = func_1()
        a = func_5()
        b = func_5()
        c = func_5()

            else:
                ans[i] = c[i]
        func_20(*ans)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function processes a series of test cases where for each test case it reads an integer `n` and three lists `a`, `b`, and `c`, each containing `n` integers. It constructs a new list `ans` where each element is taken from `a`, `b`, or `c`, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in `ans` are the same. The function then calls `func_20` with the constructed `ans` list for each test case. It does not accept parameters directly but relies on predefined input constraints.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
