The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. The contents of the list are based on integer constraints defined for test cases that involve integers `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i` which are not explicitly passed to `func_5` but are instead presumably defined in the broader scope of the program.
