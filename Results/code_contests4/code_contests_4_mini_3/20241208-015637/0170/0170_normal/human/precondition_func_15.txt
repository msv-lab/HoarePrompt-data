x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100); for each test case, y is an integer representing the number of elements in the sequences (3 ≤ y ≤ 100), followed by three lists of integers a, b, and c of length y, where each integer in these lists (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) satisfies the condition that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, and b_i ≠ c_i for all i.
