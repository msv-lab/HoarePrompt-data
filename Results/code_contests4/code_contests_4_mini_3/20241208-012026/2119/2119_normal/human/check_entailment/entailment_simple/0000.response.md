To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

**Problem Breakdown:**
1. The player starts with a queen of spades, which has a value of 10 points.
2. The goal is to determine how many valid second cards can be drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards such that the total points equal `n`.
3. The valid cards are:
   - Cards with values 2 through 10, which have points from 2 to 10.
   - Picture cards (jack, queen, king) which are worth 10 points.
   - Aces, which can be worth either 1 or 11 points.
4. The result should account for the fact that the queen of spades is already in play and should not be counted again.

**Logic of the Provided Program:**
The function `func` uses a hardcoded list to map the required sum `n` (adjusted by subtracting 10) to the number of valid second cards. The list is indexed from `n - 10`, which means:
- When `n = 12` (which gives an index of 2), the program outputs `4`, indicating there are 4 valid cards (all 2's of different suits).
- When `n = 20` (which gives an index of 10), it outputs `15`, indicating that there are 15 valid cards (10's, jacks, queens, kings).
- When `n = 10` (which gives an index of 0), it outputs `0`, indicating that there are no valid cards that add to 10 (since the queen of spades is already counted).

**Verification Against Problem Requirements:**
1. **For n = 12:** The total needed is 12, and the only way to do this with the first card (10 points) is with 2 points from a second card, which can be achieved by drawing any of the four 2's. The output is correctly `4`.
   
2. **For n = 20:** The total needed is 20, and the valid cards to achieve this (considering the first card's value of 10) are the 10's, jacks, queens (excluding the queen of spades), and kings. This gives 15 valid cards. The output is correctly `15`.

3. **For n = 10:** The total needed is 10, and there are no second cards that can add to zero (as explained in the problem). The output is correctly `0`.

**Potential Issue:**
The list used in the program is hardcoded and strictly indexed. Although it produces the correct outputs for the provided examples, it assumes the input `n` will always fall within the range of valid indices (0 to 14). However, if `n` were to fall outside the specified range (1 to 25), it could lead to an IndexError or incorrect results. Additionally, the logic doesn't dynamically calculate valid card counts but relies on predefined values, which could be seen as inflexible.

**Conclusion:**
While the provided program gives correct outputs for the test cases in the problem description, its reliance on hardcoded values and the fixed range of inputs means it does not robustly handle all possible cases. Therefore, it does not fully meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
