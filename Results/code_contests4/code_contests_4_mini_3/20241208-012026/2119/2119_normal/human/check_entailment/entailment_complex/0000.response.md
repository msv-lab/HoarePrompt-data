Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks for the number of ways to get a second card such that the sum of the points equals `n`, given that the first card is the queen of spades, which is worth 10 points. Therefore, the required value for the second card to achieve this sum is `n - 10`.

2. **Card Values**: The valid card values in blackjack are:
   - Cards from 2 to 10 are worth their face values (2-10 points).
   - The jack, queen, and king are each worth 10 points.
   - An ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points.

3. **Calculation of Valid Cards**: 
   - If `n` is less than 10, there are no valid cards since the minimum value that can be added to 10 is 2 (10 + 2 = 12). Thus the output should be `0`.
   - If `n` is between 10 and 20, the valid cards would include any card worth `n-10` points, excluding the queen of spades which is already in play.
   - If `n` is greater than 20, the valid cards would be the 10-point cards (tens, jacks, queens, kings), as well as the ace valued at 11, leading to a total of 15 possible cards.

4. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The provided program uses a fixed list to print outputs based on adjusted input values, which does not correctly account for the logic described above.
   - For example, if `n = 10`, it should output `0`, but the program will raise an `IndexError` because it is trying to access an invalid index in the list.
   - The program does not dynamically calculate the number of valid cards based on the input value `n`.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Thus, it is incorrect and does not handle all edge cases properly.
