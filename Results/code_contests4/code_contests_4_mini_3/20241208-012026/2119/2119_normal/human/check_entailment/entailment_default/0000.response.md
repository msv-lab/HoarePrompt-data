To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break down the components step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task requires determining how many ways the player can get a second card such that the total points equal a specified number `n`. The first card is fixed as the queen of spades, which is worth 10 points. 

### Card Values:
- Cards 2-10 have values 2-10 (4 of each).
- Jacks, Queens, and Kings (including the queen of spades) are valued at 10 points (4 of each, but one queen is already used).
- Aces can be either 1 or 11 points.

### The Required Output:
- The output should be the number of valid second cards that, when added to 10 (the value of the queen), equal `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The program uses a list to index results based on the input adjusted by 10:
```python
print[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0][input() - 10]
```

- The list is indexed using `input() - 10`, which means valid inputs must be between 10 and 25 (inclusive). Inputs outside this range will lead to an `IndexError`.
- The values in the list correspond to the number of valid cards for each possible total points from 10 to 25.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate the function accepts no parameters and prints a value from a pre-defined list based on user input. It also mentions that an `IndexError` will occur if the input is outside the valid range.

### Validating Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum input (n = 1)**: 
   - The correct output should be 0 since you can't achieve 1 point with a queen worth 10.

2. **Maximum input (n = 25)**:
   - The correct output should be 0 because no card can add to 10 to make 25.

3. **Input of 10**:
   - The output should be 0 (no second card can add to 10).
   
4. **Input of 12**:
   - The output should be 4 (four 2s).
   
5. **Input of 20**:
   - The output should be 15 (all the 10-value cards, minus the queen of spades).

The code handles these cases correctly, except for the potential for an error when the input is outside of the range 10-25, which is not addressed in the problem statement nor handled gracefully.

### Conclusion:
The program does not work correctly for inputs outside the specified range, which violates the problem description's requirements. Therefore, even though the outputs for valid inputs appear to be correct, the program's handling of invalid inputs leads to it being incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program fails to handle cases where the input is outside of the expected range (1 ≤ n ≤ 25), resulting in an `IndexError`, which is not part of the problem description.
