The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes an integer input from the user, which is expected to be in the range of 1 to 25, and uses this input to index into a predefined list. The list contains integer values, and the input is adjusted by subtracting 10 from it to derive the index. If the adjusted input is within the valid range (0 to 15), the function will print the corresponding value from the list. However, if the input value is less than 10 or greater than 25, it will result in an `IndexError` due to attempting to access an invalid index in the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to print a value from a fixed list based on user input, but it may raise an error if the input is outside the expected range.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prints a value from a pre-defined list based on user input, adjusted by subtracting 10. If the input is outside the range of 10 to 25, it will raise an IndexError due to invalid list indexing. **
