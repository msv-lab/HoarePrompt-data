The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraint that the integer `n` is within the range of 1 to 25. Since no specific output conditions are provided, the functionality of the function remains unspecified. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraint that n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 25, but the specific return value is not provided.**
