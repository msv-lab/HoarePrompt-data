Correctness: **False**.

The provided program uses a list to directly map inputs to outputs based on the required sum of points. However, there are critical flaws in its logic. 

For example:
- When the input is `11`, the expected output should be `4` (four 2's of different suits), but the program does not handle this case as it maps to a value that doesn't correspond to the expected outcome.
- Specifically, it also fails to account for the fact that the card values must be calculated correctly based on what the player's first card is, which is a queen (10 points). 

The program does not handle all possible values of `n` from 1 to 25 correctly, as it only considers a specific set of outputs based on a predefined list. Thus, the mapping does not cover all cases, leading to incorrect results for various inputs.
