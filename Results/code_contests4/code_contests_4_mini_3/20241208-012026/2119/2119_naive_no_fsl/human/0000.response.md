Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. 

### Analysis:
1. The program uses a list to map the input directly to an output based on the index derived from the input value. The list is structured as follows:
   ```
   [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ```
   - This list corresponds to the outputs for inputs ranging from 10 to 25.

2. The mapping implies:
   - For inputs `10` (output `0`), `11` (output `4`), `12` (output `4`), `13` (output `4`), etc., the program seems to return expected results based on the examples given.
   - However, it includes hardcoded values that do not appropriately cover all possible inputs or cases, particularly when the input value is less than `10`.

3. **Missing Cases**:
   - If the input is less than `10`, the program will attempt to access negative indices of the list, which will lead to an `IndexError`. For instance, if `n = 1`, the calculation `input() - 10` results in `-9`, which is out of bounds.
   - For values like `n = 9` or `n = 8`, there are no defined outputs in the list, leading to potential errors or incorrect behavior.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle inputs below `10` properly and does not cover all specified cases, resulting in an output that is potentially undefined or erroneous.
