To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have two children at positions A and B on a number line.
2. The child at A can move a distance of V per second, and the child at B can move a distance of W per second.
3. We need to determine if the child at A can catch the child at B within T seconds.

### Requirements:
- The child at A can reach a position `A + V * T` after T seconds.
- The child at B can reach a position `B + W * T` after T seconds.
- If A < B, to catch the child at B, we need `A + V * T` to be greater than or equal to `B + W * T`.
- If A > B, to catch the child at B, we need `B + W * T` to be greater than or equal to `A + V * T`.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(A, B, V, W, T)` implements this logic:
1. It calculates `la` as `A + V * T`.
2. It calculates `lb` as `B + W * T`.
3. If A < B, it checks if `la >= lb`.
4. If A > B (the else case), it checks if `lb >= la`.

### Logical Flow:
- The program correctly identifies the two cases (A < B and A > B).
- It appropriately checks whether the child at A can catch the child at B based on their respective movements and the total distance they can travel in T seconds.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as specified in the description. It calculates the positions of both children after T seconds and determines if the child at A can catch the child at B based on their speeds and initial positions.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
