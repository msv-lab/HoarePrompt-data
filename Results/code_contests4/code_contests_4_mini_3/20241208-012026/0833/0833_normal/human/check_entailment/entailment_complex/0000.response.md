To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it correctly implements the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Two children are at positions A and B, with speeds V and W, respectively.
2. We need to determine if the child at position A ("it") can catch the child at position B within T seconds.
3. The child at A can move to `A + V * T` in T seconds.
4. The child at B can move to `B + W * T` in T seconds.
5. "It" catches the other child if both children are at the same position after T seconds.

### Annotated Program Logic:
```python
def func_1(A, B, V, W, T):
    la = A + V * T  # Position of "it" after T seconds
    lb = B + W * T  # Position of the other child after T seconds
    if (A < B):
        return la >= lb  # Checks if "it" can catch the other child
    else:
        return lb >= la  # Checks if "it" can catch the other child
```

### Analysis:
1. The program calculates `la` (the position of "it" after T seconds) and `lb` (the position of the other child after T seconds).
2. It then checks whether `la` is greater than or equal to `lb` if `A < B`, or whether `lb` is greater than or equal to `la` if `A > B`.

### Correctness Review:
- The conditions used in the program:
  - If `A < B`, "it" must move faster or at least as fast as the other child to catch up. The condition `la >= lb` checks this.
  - If `A > B`, the condition `lb >= la` checks if the other child is able to move away faster than "it" can reach her.
  
### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the case where `A` and `B` might be very close to each other or far apart, as it only checks the relative speeds and positions after T seconds.
- It also adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, ensuring that A is never equal to B, and all input values are within specified ranges.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required to determine whether "it" can catch the other child within the specified time T, based on their starting positions and speeds.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True**
