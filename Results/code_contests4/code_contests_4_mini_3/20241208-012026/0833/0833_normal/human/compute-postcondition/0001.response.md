In the given code, `lb` is assigned the value of `B + W * T`. Since `B`, `W`, and `T` are integers within the specified ranges, the calculation of `lb` will depend on their specific values. The initial state of `A`, `B`, `V`, `W`, and `T` is provided, and we know that `la` is already calculated as `A + V * T`. 

The value of `lb` is directly influenced by the values of `B`, `W`, and `T`. The previous values of these variables will determine the outcome for `lb`. 

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9 and A != B; `V` and `W` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); `T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); `la` is calculated as `A + V * T`; `lb` is calculated as `B + W * T`.**
