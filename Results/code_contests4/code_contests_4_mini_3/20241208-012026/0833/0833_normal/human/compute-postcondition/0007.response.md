Functionality: ** The function accepts five integer parameters A, B, V, W, and T. It calculates two values, la = A + V * T and lb = B + W * T. The function returns True if la is greater than or equal to lb when A is less than B, and returns True if lb is greater than or equal to la when A is greater than or equal to B. The function effectively checks which of the two calculated values is greater based on the initial values of A and B, ensuring that A is never equal to B as per input constraints. **
