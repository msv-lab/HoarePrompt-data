The function `func_1` accepts parameters `A`, `B`, `V`, `W`, and `T`. Here are the details: 

- `A` and `B` are integers with the constraint that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9 and A != B.
- `V` and `W` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- `T` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

Based on the conditions provided in the output:

- **Case 1**: If `A` is less than `B`, the function returns whether `la` (calculated as `A + V * T`) is greater than or equal to `lb` (calculated as `B + W * T`).

- **Case 2**: If `A` is greater than or equal to `B`, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `lb` (which is `B + W * T`) is greater than or equal to `la` (which is `A + V * T`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `A`, `B`, `V`, `W`, and `T`, and based on the comparison of `A` and `B`, it returns a boolean value indicating the relationship between the calculated values `la` and `lb`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters A, B, V, W, and T, and returns a boolean value based on the comparison of la and lb, where la is A + V * T and lb is B + W * T.**
