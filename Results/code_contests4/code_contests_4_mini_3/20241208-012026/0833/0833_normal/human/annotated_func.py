#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9 and A != B; V and W are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); T is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
def func_1(A, B, V, W, T):
    la = A + V * T
    lb = B + W * T
    if (A < B) :
        return la >= lb
        #The program returns whether la, which is A + V * T, is greater than or equal to lb, which is B + W * T, given that A is less than B.
    else :
        return lb >= la
        #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether lb is greater than or equal to la, where lb is calculated as B + W * T and la as A + V * T, given that A is greater than or equal to B.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five integer parameters A, B, V, W, and T. It calculates two values, la = A + V * T and lb = B + W * T. The function returns True if la is greater than or equal to lb when A is less than B, and returns True if lb is greater than or equal to la when A is greater than or equal to B. The function effectively checks which of the two calculated values is greater based on the initial values of A and B, ensuring that A is never equal to B as per input constraints.
