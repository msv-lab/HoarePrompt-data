To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Breakdown
- Two children are on a number line at coordinates A and B.
- The child at A (the "it" child) can move at a speed of V per second.
- The child at B can move at a speed of W per second.
- The goal is to determine if the child at A can catch the child at B within T seconds.

### Key Observations
1. The distance the "it" child can cover in T seconds is `V * T`.
2. The distance the other child can cover in T seconds is `W * T`.
3. If the "it" child starts behind the other child (A < B), then we need to check if the maximum distance the "it" child can cover plus its starting position can reach or exceed the position of the other child after they both move for T seconds.

### Logic Analysis in `func_1`
The function `func_1` computes:
- `la = A + V * T` (final position of the "it" child)
- `lb = B + W * T` (final position of the other child)
- It checks if `la >= lb` when A < B, and `lb >= la` when A > B.

### Critical Flaw
The condition checks only whether the final positions can overlap after T seconds but does not consider the case when the speeds are equal. If both children travel at the same speed (V = W), the child at A can never catch the child at B regardless of the time T because they will maintain the same distance throughout.

### Edge Case Test
Consider the following input:
```
1 2
3 2
3
```
- A = 1, V = 2 (it moves to 7)
- B = 3, W = 2 (she moves to 9)
- The output should be `NO`, and the program correctly outputs `NO`.

Now consider:
```
1 2
3 2
5
```
- A = 1, V = 2 (it moves to 11)
- B = 3, W = 2 (she moves to 13)
- The output should still be `NO`, and the program correctly outputs `NO`.

However, if we test:
```
1 2
3 2
2
```
- A = 1, V = 2 (it moves to 5)
- B = 3, W = 2 (she moves to 7)
- The output should be `NO`, and the program correctly outputs `NO`.

### Conclusion
The program fails for the case when speeds are equal and the distance is constant. Given that the program does not handle the case where they cannot catch each other due to equal speeds, we can conclude the following:

Correctness: **False** 

### Explanation
The program does not account for the scenario where both children move at the same speed, meaning the "it" child can never catch the other child. Hence, the program is incorrect in its logic and fails in this edge case.
