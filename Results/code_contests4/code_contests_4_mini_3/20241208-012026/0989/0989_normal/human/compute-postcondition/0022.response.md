The code `tem[i] = str(int(tem[i]) + 1)` takes the current value of `tem[i]`, converts it to an integer, increments it by 1, and then converts it back to a string before assigning it back to `tem[i]`. 

Since `i` is defined as `n - 3`, its value will depend on the value of `n`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be at least `-2`. The output state will depend on the specific value of `tem[i]` prior to the execution of the code snippet. However, since `tem` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value.

Therefore, we can say that `tem[i]` is updated based on its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 3`, and `tem[i]` is updated to str(int(tem[i]) + 1)**
