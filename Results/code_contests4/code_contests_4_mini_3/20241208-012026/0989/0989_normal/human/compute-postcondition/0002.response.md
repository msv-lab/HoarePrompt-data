The variable `tem` is assigned the value `'1'` concatenated with `'0'` repeated `(n - 1)` times. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `tem` will be a string that starts with `'1'` followed by `n - 1` zeros. The value of `s` and its length do not affect the computation of `tem`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the specific assignment to `tem` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `tem` is '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros.**
