The variable `tem[i]` is assigned the value '0', regardless of its previous value. The initial state indicates that `tem[i]` was not equal to '9', and now it is updated to '0'. Other variables remain unaffected, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement as stated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `tem[i]` is '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
