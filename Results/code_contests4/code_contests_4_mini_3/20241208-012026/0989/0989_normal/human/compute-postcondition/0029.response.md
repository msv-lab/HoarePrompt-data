Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer and `s` is a string of length that is a multiple of `n`. If the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, the output is `ans1` (a string of '9's repeated `len(s) // n` times). Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `tem` is formed by taking the first `n` characters of `s` and incrementing the last character (if it is not '9'), or setting all characters to '0' if they are all '9'. The output is `ans1` if it is greater than `s`, otherwise it is `ans2` (the modified `tem` repeated `len(s) // n` times).***
