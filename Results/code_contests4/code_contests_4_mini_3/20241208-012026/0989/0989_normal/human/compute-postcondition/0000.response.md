The variables `n` and `s` are assigned values based on user input. `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, converting the input string to an integer, while `s` is assigned the value of `stdin.readline().strip()`, which reads a line from standard input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. Since the initial state provided only specifies the constraints on `L` and `A` but does not provide their specific values, we assume they can be any valid values within those constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input read from stdin and stripped of whitespace.**
