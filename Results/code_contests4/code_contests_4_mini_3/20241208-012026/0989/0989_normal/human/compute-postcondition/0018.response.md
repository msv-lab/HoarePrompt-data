The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `tem[i]` is updated to `str(int(tem[i]) + 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
