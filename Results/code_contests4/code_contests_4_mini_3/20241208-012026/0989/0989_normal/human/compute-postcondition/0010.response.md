According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, as it iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. The states `ans1` and `tem` are derived from `s` and `n`, and they don't affect the loop's ability to execute. 

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need `n` to be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `0` when the loop executes for the last time. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time**
