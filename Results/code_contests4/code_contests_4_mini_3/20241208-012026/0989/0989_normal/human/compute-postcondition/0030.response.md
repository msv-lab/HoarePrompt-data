Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer and `s` is a string stripped of whitespace. If the length of `s` is not a multiple of `n`, the output is a string `tem` which consists of '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros, repeated `len(s) // n + 1` times. If the length of `s` is a multiple of `n`, and if the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, the output is a string of '9's repeated `len(s) // n` times. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `tem` is formed by taking the first `n` characters of `s` and incrementing the last character (if it is not '9'), or setting all characters to '0' if they are all '9'. The output will be `ans1` if it is greater than `s`, otherwise, it will be `ans2`, which is the modified `tem` repeated `len(s) // n` times.***
