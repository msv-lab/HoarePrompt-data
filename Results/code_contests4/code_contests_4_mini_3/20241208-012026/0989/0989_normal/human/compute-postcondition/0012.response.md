The value of `tem[i]` is updated by converting it to an integer, adding 1, and then converting it back to a string. Since `i` is `n - 1` and `tem[i]` is not '9', the previous value of `tem[i]` can be any valid integer string from '0' to '8'. Therefore, after the operation, `tem[i]` will increase by 1, resulting in values from '1' to '9'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and `tem[i]` is updated to `str(int(tem[i]) + 1)`**
