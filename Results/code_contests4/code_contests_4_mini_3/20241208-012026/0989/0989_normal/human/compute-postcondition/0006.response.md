The variable `ans1` is assigned the value `'9' * len(s)`, which means it will be a string composed of '9' repeated for the length of `s`. The variable `ans2` is assigned the value `'1' + '0' * n`, which will result in a string that starts with '1' followed by '0' repeated `n` times. 

Given that the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9', `ans1` will be a string of '9's of the same length as `s`, and `ans2` will be a string that represents the number `10^n` (for example, if `n` is 2, `ans2` would be '100').

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input read from stdin and stripped of whitespace (length is a multiple of `n`), `ans1` is a string of '9's with length equal to `s`, and `ans2` is '1' followed by '0' repeated `n` times.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input read from stdin and stripped of whitespace, `ans1` is a string of '9's with length equal to `s`, `ans2` is '1' followed by '0' repeated `n` times.**
