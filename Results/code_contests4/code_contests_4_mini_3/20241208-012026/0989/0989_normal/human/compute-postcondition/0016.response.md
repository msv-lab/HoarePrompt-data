According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. This means `i` will become `n - 2`. 

Furthermore, since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Thus, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
