According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` as it iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n - 3`. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the loop is valid.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
