You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Alice became interested in periods of integer numbers. We say positive X integer number is periodic with length L if there exists positive integer number P with L digits such that X can be written as PPPP…P. For example:

X = 123123123 is periodic number with length L = 3 and L = 9

X = 42424242 is periodic number with length L = 2,L = 4 and L = 8

X = 12345 is periodic number with length L = 5

For given positive period length L and positive integer number A, Alice wants to find smallest integer number X strictly greater than A that is periodic with length L.

Input

First line contains one positive integer number L \ (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5) representing length of the period. Second line contains one positive integer number A \ (1 ≤ A ≤ 10^{100 000}).

Output

One positive integer number representing smallest positive number that is periodic with length L and is greater than A.

Examples

Input


3
123456


Output


124124


Input


3
12345


Output


100100

Note

In first example 124124 is the smallest number greater than 123456 that can be written with period L = 3 (P = 124).

In the second example 100100 is the smallest number greater than 12345 with period L = 3 (P=100)
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, and A is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100,000 characters, where each character is a digit from 1 to 9, and A is strictly less than 10^100,000.
def func():
    n, s = int(input()), stdin.readline().strip()
    if (len(s) % n) :
        tem = '1' + '0' * (n - 1)
        print(tem * (len(s) // n + 1))
    else :
        if (s[:n] == '9' * n) :
            ans1, ans2 = '9' * len(s), '1' + '0' * n
            print(ans1 if ans1 > s else ans2 * (len(s) // n))
        else :
            ans1, tem = s[:n] * (len(s) // n), list(s[:n])
            for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if tem[i] != '9':
                    tem[i] = str(int(tem[i]) + 1)
                    break
                
                tem[i] = '0'
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s`, with the last character incremented by 1 (if it was not '9'), or all characters set to '0' if they were all '9'.
            ans2 = ''.join(tem) * (len(s) // n)
            print(ans1 if ans1 > s else ans2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer and `s` is a string of length that is a multiple of `n`. If the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, the output is `ans1` (a string of '9's repeated `len(s) // n` times). Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `tem` is formed by taking the first `n` characters of `s` and incrementing the last character (if it is not '9'), or setting all characters to '0' if they are all '9'. The output is `ans1` if it is greater than `s`, otherwise it is `ans2` (the modified `tem` repeated `len(s) // n` times).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer and `s` is a string stripped of whitespace. If the length of `s` is not a multiple of `n`, the output is a string `tem` which consists of '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros, repeated `len(s) // n + 1` times. If the length of `s` is a multiple of `n`, and if the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, the output is a string of '9's repeated `len(s) // n` times. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `tem` is formed by taking the first `n` characters of `s` and incrementing the last character (if it is not '9'), or setting all characters to '0' if they are all '9'. The output will be `ans1` if it is greater than `s`, otherwise, it will be `ans2`, which is the modified `tem` repeated `len(s) // n` times.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
