`hand` is modified by appending the character `str[i]` at index `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `hand` will now include the character at index 1 of the string `str`. The previous state of `hand` will determine its new state. Since `str` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P', and `i` is 1, `hand` will have an additional character appended to it. The states of `n`, `count`, and `i` are not affected. 

Output State: **`str` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P'; `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100 and greater than 0; `count` is either 0 or 1; `hand` has 2 characters (original character + str[1]); `i` is 1**
