Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P', processes it to count the number of segments of different characters, where each segment can consist of up to 5 identical characters. It returns the total count of these segments, incrementing by one if the last segment is not empty. The function does not handle edge cases related to invalid characters in the input string or strings longer than 100 characters, as assumed by the precondition. **
