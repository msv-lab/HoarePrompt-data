Postcondition: ***`str` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P', `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100 and greater than 0, and `count` is either 0 or 1. If `str[i]` equals the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` has one more element and `count` remains 0. Otherwise, `count` is 1, `hand` is set to contain only the first character of `str`, and `i` remains 0.***
