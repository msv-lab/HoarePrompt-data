Postcondition: ***`str` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P'; `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100 and greater than 0; `count` is either 0, 1, or 2; if `str[i]` is equal to `hand[-1]` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` now has 2 characters (the original character plus the character at index 1) and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `hand` is set to the character at index `i` of `str` and `i` remains 1.***
