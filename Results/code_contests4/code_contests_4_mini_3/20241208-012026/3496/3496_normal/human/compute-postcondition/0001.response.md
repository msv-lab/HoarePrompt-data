The value of `n` is assigned the length of `str`. Since `str` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P', we can determine that `n` will be a positive integer representing the number of characters in `str`, which does not exceed 100. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `str` is assigned a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P'; `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100 representing the length of `str`.

Output State: **`str` is assigned a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P'; `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100 representing the length of `str`.**
