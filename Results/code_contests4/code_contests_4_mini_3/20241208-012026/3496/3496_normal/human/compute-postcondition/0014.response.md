Postcondition: ***`str` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P', `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100 and greater than 0, `count` is either 0 or 1. If `hand` was empty, it now contains the first character of `str`, making its length 1, and `i` is 0. If `hand` was not empty, and if `str[i]` equals the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` has one more element and `count` remains 0; otherwise, `count` is set to 1, `hand` is reset to contain only the first character of `str`, and `i` remains 0.***
