Postcondition: ***`str` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P'; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `hand` is updated to include the character at index 2 of `str`. If the length of `hand` is 0, `hand` becomes a list containing the character at index 2 of `str`. If the length of `hand` is not 0, `hand` is updated to include the character at index 2 of `str`; if `str[i]` is equal to the last character of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` is updated to include the character at index 2 of `str`. Otherwise, `hand` remains as a list containing the character at index 2 of `str` with `count` possibly being 1, 2, or 3.***
