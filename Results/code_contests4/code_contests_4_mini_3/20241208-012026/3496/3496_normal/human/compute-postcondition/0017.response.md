The code `hand.append(str[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `str` to the list `hand`. Given that `i` is 1, we will append the second character of `str` (since indexing starts at 0). The initial state does not change any other variables, so the output state reflects the updated `hand` with the appended character from `str`.

Output State: **`str` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P', `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100 and greater than 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, `hand` now has 2 characters (the original character plus the character at index 1), `i` is 1.**
