The code initializes an empty list `hand`. The values of the other variables (`str`, `n`, and `count`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `str` is assigned a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P'; `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100; `count` is 0; `hand` is an empty list.

Output State: **`str` is assigned a non-empty string consisting of characters 'C' and 'P'; `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 100; `count` is 0; `hand` is an empty list.**
