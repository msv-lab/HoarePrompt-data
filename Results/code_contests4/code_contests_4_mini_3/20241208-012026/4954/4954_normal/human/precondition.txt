N is a positive integer representing the number of code pieces (1 <= N <= 20), M is a positive integer representing the number of characteristics for each code piece (1 <= M <= 20), C is an integer, B is a list of M integers where each B_i is between -100 and 100, and A is a 2D list of integers where each A_{ij} is between -100 and 100 for i in range(N) and j in range(M).
