Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. However, this does not directly affect the logic but could lead to runtime errors in a Python 3 environment.

2. The code initializes `B` using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means `B` is a map object in Python 2. This should be converted to a list for further operations. In Python 3, it will need to be explicitly converted to a list; otherwise, operations on `B` will not work as intended.

3. The code reads each row of `A` using `A = map(int, raw_input().split())`, which also should be converted to a list for proper handling.

4. The program calculates the sum of products of the corresponding elements of `A` and `B` correctly with `sum(tmp) + C > 0`, which aligns with the requirement of the problem description.

5. After processing all codes, the program correctly prints the count of codes that satisfy the condition.

However, the program lacks sufficient handling for the case of reading input and storing it correctly in Python 3. If run in a Python 3 environment, it would raise errors. Moreover, if any of the assumptions regarding input format are not met (e.g., incorrect number of integers per line), the program will fail.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description due to potential input handling issues and format inconsistencies, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
