Precondition: **N is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), M is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), C is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), and B is a list of M integers where each B_i is in the range (-100 <= B_i <= 100). A is a 2D list of integers with N rows and M columns, where each A_{ij} is in the range (-100 <= A_{ij} <= 100).**
