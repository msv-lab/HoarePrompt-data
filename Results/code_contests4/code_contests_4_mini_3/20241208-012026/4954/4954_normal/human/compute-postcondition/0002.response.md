The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. There are no changes to the values of `N`, `M`, `C`, or the list `B`, as they remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `ans`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `M` is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), `C` is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), `B` is a list of `M` integers where each `B_i` is in the range (-100 <= B_i <= 100); `ans` is 0**
