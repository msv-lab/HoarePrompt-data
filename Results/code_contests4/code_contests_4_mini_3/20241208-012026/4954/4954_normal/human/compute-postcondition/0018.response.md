Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is equal to the previous `i + 1`, which is less than `N`; `A` is a map object containing integers from the input; `tmp` is a list containing the products of elements from `A` and `B` for indices in the range of `M`. If the sum of `tmp` plus `C` is greater than 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1.***
