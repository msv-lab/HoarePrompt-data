Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than 1, `M` is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), `C` is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), `B` is a list of `M` integers where each `B_i` is in the range (-100 <= B_i <= 100), `A` is a list of integers obtained from input; `tmp` is a list of products of corresponding elements of `A` and `B` for the first `M` indices. If the sum of `tmp` plus `C` is greater than 0, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
