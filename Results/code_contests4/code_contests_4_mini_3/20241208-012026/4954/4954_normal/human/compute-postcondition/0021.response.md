The function `func` accepts several parameters: `N`, `M`, `C`, `B`, and `A`. 

- `N` is a positive integer that must be between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `M` is a positive integer that must also be between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `C` is an integer that can range from -100 to 100 (inclusive).
- `B` is a list of integers with a length of `M`, where each element `B_i` is in the range from -100 to 100 (inclusive).
- `A` is a 2D list (a list of lists) containing integers with `N` rows and `M` columns, where each element `A_{ij}` is in the range from -100 to 100 (inclusive).

The output of the function is not provided in the constraints, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information. Therefore, we can only outline the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (positive integer), M (positive integer), C (integer), B (list of M integers), and A (2D list of integers with N rows and M columns).**
