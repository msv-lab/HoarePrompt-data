According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `N`. The loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `N-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Since `N` is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` was incremented, we can conclude that `i` is now equal to the previous value plus 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is equal to the previous `i + 1`, which must be less than `N`**
