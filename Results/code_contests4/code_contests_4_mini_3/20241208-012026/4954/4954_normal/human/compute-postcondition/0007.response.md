The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 0, so after execution, `ans` will be 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `M` is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), `C` is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), `B` is a list of `M` integers where each `B_i` is in the range (-100 <= B_i <= 100), `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and `tmp` is a list of products of corresponding elements from `A` and `B` for indices in the range of `M`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `M` is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), `C` is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), `B` is a list of `M` integers where each `B_i` is in the range (-100 <= B_i <= 100), `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and `tmp` is a list of products of corresponding elements from `A` and `B` for indices in the range of `M`.**
