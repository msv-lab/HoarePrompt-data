The variable `A` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts a line of input, `split()` divides that input into separate strings, and `int` converts those strings to integers. The specific values of `N`, `M`, `C`, and `B` are not affected by this operation, but `A` will contain the integers obtained from the input. Since we don't know the specific integers from the input, we will represent `A` as a list of integers based on the unspecified input. 

The output state thus reflects the unchanged variables and the new variable `A`, which now holds a list of integers.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 1, `M` is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), `C` is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), `B` is a list of `M` integers where each `B_i` is in the range (-100 <= B_i <= 100), `A` is a list of integers obtained from input.**
