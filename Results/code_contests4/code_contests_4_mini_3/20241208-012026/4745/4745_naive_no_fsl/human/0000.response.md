Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
5
3 3 2 2 1
```

In this case, the heights are strictly decreasing, and the program will output "Yes" because it can decrease the heights accordingly to make them non-decreasing. However, the correct output should be "No" because the only allowed operation is to decrease the height by 1 at most once for each square, and there is no way to rearrange these squares to meet the non-decreasing requirement starting from the leftmost square.

The logic in the program fails in scenarios where the heights are not strictly increasing but require multiple decreases to achieve a non-decreasing order. Hence, the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description for all potential inputs.
