To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program in conjunction with the requirements stated.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program must determine if it is possible to perform operations to make the heights of the squares non-decreasing from left to right. The allowed operations are:
1. Decrease the height of a square by 1.
2. Do nothing.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The first line reads `N`, the number of squares.
   - The second line reads `H`, a list of heights.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program initializes `last` to the height of the last square and iterates backwards through the list of heights.
   - For each height `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is greater than `last`.
   - If the difference (`d`) between `arr[i]` and `last` is greater than 1, it prints `No` and exits.
   - If the height `arr[i]` is not greater than `last`, it updates `last` to the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`.

3. **Final Decision**:
   - If the loop completes without printing `No`, it prints `Yes`.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program checks if any height exceeds the last height by more than 1. If it does, it concludes that it is impossible to adjust the heights to meet the non-decreasing requirement, as you can only decrease heights or keep them the same.
- However, the logic has a flaw: it only checks if the difference is more than 1 but does not account for the fact that when moving left from the last square, any square can still be reduced to the height of the previous square as long as the heights eventually settle to a non-decreasing order.
  
### Example Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   ```
   4
   1 3 2 1
   ```
   - The program would check heights as follows:
     1. `1` (last) - no action, `last` becomes `1`.
     2. `2` (current) - `2 > 1`, `d = 1`, allowed, `last` becomes `1`.
     3. `3` (current) - `3 > 1`, `d = 2`, prints `No`.
   - The correct output should be `No`, which it produces.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   5
   1 2 1 1 3
   ```
   - The program would check heights as follows:
     1. `3` (last) - no action, `last` becomes `3`.
     2. `1` (current) - `1 <= 3`, allowed, `last` becomes `1`.
     3. `1` (current) - `1 <= 1`, allowed, `last` remains `1`.
     4. `2` (current) - `2 > 1`, `d = 1`, allowed, `last` becomes `1`.
     5. `1` (current) - `1 <= 1`, allowed, `last` remains `1`.
   - The correct output should be `Yes`, which it produces.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles situations where a height can be reduced to match the previous height in the sequence. It fails to ensure that all heights can be adjusted appropriately to meet the non-decreasing condition. 

Thus, the program does not fully align with the problem description, as it does not properly check all necessary conditions for the heights to be non-decreasing.

Correctness: **False**
