Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the heights of the squares non-decreasing by decreasing the heights by at most 1 or doing nothing.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Logic for Non-Decreasing Order**: The program checks the squares in reverse order (from right to left) and maintains a variable `last` to track the minimum height allowed for the current square. If the height of the current square is greater than `last`, it calculates the difference and checks if that difference is greater than 1. If it is, the program prints "No" and exits. This logic is flawed because there can be cases where a square's height is not greater than the `last` but still does not allow for a valid non-decreasing sequence when considered with the left neighbors.

2. **Failure to Consider All Cases**: The program only looks at whether the current height can be reduced to match the previous `last` height. It does not check if reducing a square's height by 1 would make it impossible for subsequent squares to satisfy the non-decreasing condition. For example, if the heights are `[4, 2, 3]`, the program would output "Yes" because it reduces the `4` to `3`, but the correct answer should be "No" because the heights cannot be made non-decreasing.

3. **Incorrect Output on Valid Inputs**: The implementation may produce incorrect results for valid inputs where the height difference allows for adjustments but still cannot satisfy the non-decreasing condition.

### Conclusion:
The logic of the program fails to consider the necessary conditions for all potential cases of making the heights non-decreasing. Therefore, it does not accurately fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
