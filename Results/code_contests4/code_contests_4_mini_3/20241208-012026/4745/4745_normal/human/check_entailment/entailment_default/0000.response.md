To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the task:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array of heights for squares.
- We can either decrease the height of any square by 1 or do nothing.
- We need to determine if we can make the heights non-decreasing from left to right.

### Code Analysis:
The program reads the number of squares and their respective heights. It then iterates through the heights from the last square to the first square. The logic checks if any square's height exceeds the last square's height by more than 1. If it does, it prints "No"; otherwise, it maintains the minimum height observed so far.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. If the heights are already in non-decreasing order, the program should return "Yes".
2. If there is a height that is greater than the last height by more than 1, it should return "No".
3. The program must handle cases where all squares are of the same height.
4. The program must handle cases where the heights contain large values (up to \(10^9\)).

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function checks for elements greater than the last element by more than 1. This aligns with the program's logic. However, it does not explicitly mention handling scenarios where squares can be decreased to achieve the non-decreasing condition.

### Potential Case Issues:
Let's consider a scenario where:
- Input: `5` (number of squares) and heights `1 2 3 5 4`
- The output should be "Yes" because we can decrease the last height (5) to 4, making the sequence non-decreasing.

The program does not account for the possibility of decreasing heights properly since it only checks the last height and fails to consider that we might need to decrease earlier squares to maintain non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where a square needs to be decreased to allow for a non-decreasing order. The output hints support that the code checks the condition but do not clarify that it needs to handle potential decreases more flexibly.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
