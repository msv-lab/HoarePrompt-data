The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without changing any variable values. The previous values of `last`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `last` is updated to the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `n - 2`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`; 'No' is printed, and the program exits without further execution.

Output State: **`last` is updated to the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `n - 2`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`; 'No' is printed, and the program exits without further execution.**
