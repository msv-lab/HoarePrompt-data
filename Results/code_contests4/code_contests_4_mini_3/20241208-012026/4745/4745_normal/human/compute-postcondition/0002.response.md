Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `H` is a list of `N` integers where each `H_i` is such that 1 <= `H_i` <= 10^9; `n` is assigned the value of `int(stdin.readline())`; `arr` is a list of integers converted from the input; `last` is assigned the value of `arr[n - 1]`.**
