According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined in the for loop. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to `i - 1`. 

Since the loop starts with `i` at `n - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least `0`. Thus, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is decremented to `n - 2`. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`, allowing `i` to be `0` (which is the next value in the range).

State: **`last` is updated to the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
