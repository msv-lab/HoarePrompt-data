Output State: **`last` is the minimum value from the list `arr`, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `H` is a list of `N` integers where each `H_i` is such that 1 <= `H_i` <= 10^9, `n` is the value of `int(stdin.readline())`, and `i` is -1 (indicating the loop has finished executing).**
