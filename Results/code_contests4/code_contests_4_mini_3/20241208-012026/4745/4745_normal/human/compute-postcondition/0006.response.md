Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `H` is a list of `N` integers where each `H_i` is such that 1 <= `H_i` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, `d` is `arr[i] - last` (which is positive), and `d` is greater than 1.***
