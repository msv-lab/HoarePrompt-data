The code provided is a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. There are no variable assignments or calculations that affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`last` is updated to the minimum value between `last` and `arr[n - 2]`; `i` is `n - 2`; `d` is assigned the value `arr[i] - last`, and the output is 'No'.**
