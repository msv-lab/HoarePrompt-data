The value of `last` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `arr[i]`. Since `last` is defined as the minimum value between its previous value and `arr[i]`, it can either stay the same or change to `arr[i]` if `arr[i]` is smaller. The output state will reflect the updated value of `last` based on this operation, but the exact values of `last` and `arr[i]` are not provided. Thus, the output state indicates the relationship without specific values.

Output State: **`last` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `arr[i]`**
