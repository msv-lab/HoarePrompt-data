The function `func` does not accept any parameters as defined in the function signature. However, it operates on a predefined list `H` of integers, which has a length `N` constrained to be a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. Each integer in the list `H` is also constrained to be between 1 and 10^9. 

The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot derive a specific return value. Therefore, we can only describe the constraints of the input list `H` and the fact that the function does not take any parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates on a list H of integers where the length of H is a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 100000) and each element H_i in H is an integer (1 <= H_i <= 10^9). The function does not accept any parameters.**
