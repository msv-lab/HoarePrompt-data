Postcondition: ***`last` is updated to the minimum value between `last` and `arr[n - 2]`. If `arr[n - 2]` is greater than `last`, then `d` is assigned the value of `arr[i] - last`, and if `d` is greater than 1, the output is 'No' and the program exits. If `arr[i]` is not greater than `last`, the program continues without any output or exit.***
