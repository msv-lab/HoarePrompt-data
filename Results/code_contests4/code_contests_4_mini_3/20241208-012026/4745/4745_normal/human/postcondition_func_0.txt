The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from input. It checks if there are any elements in the list that are greater than the last element (from the end of the list) by more than 1. If such an element exists, it prints 'No' and terminates. If all elements are within the allowed difference of 1 from the last element, it prints 'Yes'. It does not take any parameters directly.
