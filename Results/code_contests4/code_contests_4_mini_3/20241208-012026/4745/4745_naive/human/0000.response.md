To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to determine whether the program can always correctly decide if it's possible to make the heights of the squares non-decreasing from left to right by either decreasing the height of a square by 1 or doing nothing.

The program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of squares and their respective heights.
2. It initializes `last` to the height of the last square.
3. It iterates backwards through the squares:
   - If the current square's height is greater than `last`, it calculates the difference `d`.
   - If `d` is greater than 1, it prints 'No' and exits, as a height reduction of more than 1 would not allow for the heights to become non-decreasing.
   - It updates `last` to be the minimum of `last` and the current square's height.

The key points to consider:
- The program only allows a maximum reduction of 1 for any square that is higher than the `last` square being considered.
- If any square is more than 1 unit higher than the `last`, the program deems it impossible to achieve a non-decreasing order.

Let's consider an edge case:
- Input: `5\n3 2 2 2 1\n`
  - The heights are `[3, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.
  - Starting from the last square with height `1`, the program will evaluate:
    - Square 4 (height 2): `2 > 1`, `d = 1`, permissible. Update `last` to 1.
    - Square 3 (height 2): `2 > 1`, `d = 1`, permissible. Update `last` to 1.
    - Square 2 (height 2): `2 > 1`, `d = 1`, permissible. Update `last` to 1.
    - Square 1 (height 3): `3 > 1`, `d = 2`, which is greater than 1. The program will print 'No'.

However, in reality, it is possible to reduce the first square from 3 to 2, thus allowing the sequence to become `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, which is non-decreasing.

Thus, the program fails for this input case. 

Correctness: **False**.
