The value of `flag` is assigned to 1. The previous value of `flag` was 0, so now it becomes 1. The variables `count` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `flag` is 1, and `a` is the first character read from standard input.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `flag` is 1, and `a` is the first character read from standard input.**
