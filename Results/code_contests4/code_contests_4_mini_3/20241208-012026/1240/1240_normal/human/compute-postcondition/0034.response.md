Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 and `flag` is 0. If `a` is '/', then if `flag` is 0, `flag` is set to 1 and `a` remains the first character read from standard input. If `flag` is not 0, `flag` remains 0 and `a` remains the first character read from standard input. If `a` is a newline character, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining `count` as 0 and `flag` as 0. Otherwise, if `a` is not a newline character, `count` is set to 1, `flag` remains 0, and the character `a` is written to standard output.***
