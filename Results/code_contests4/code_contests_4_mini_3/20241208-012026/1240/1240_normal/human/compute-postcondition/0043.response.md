The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. The values of `flag` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `flag` is 0, and `a` is an input character from stdin.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `flag` is 0, and `a` is an input character from stdin**
