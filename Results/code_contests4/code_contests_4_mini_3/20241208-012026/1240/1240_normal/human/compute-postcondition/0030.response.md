`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after this operation, `count` becomes 1. The other variables, `flag` and `a`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `flag` is 0, and `a` is the first character read from standard input.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `flag` is 0, and `a` is the first character read from standard input.**
