The code `sys.stdout.write('/')` writes the character '/' to the standard output. It does not affect the values of the existing variables `count`, `flag`, or `a`. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged in terms of variable values. 

Output State: **`count` is 0, `flag` is 0, `a` is the first character read from standard input; '/' is written to standard output.**
