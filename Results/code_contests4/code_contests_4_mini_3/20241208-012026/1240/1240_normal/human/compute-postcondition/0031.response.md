The code `sys.stdout.write(a)` outputs the character stored in variable `a` to standard output. The values of the other variables, `count` and `flag`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `flag` is 0, and the character `a` is written to standard output.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `flag` is 0, and the character `a` is written to standard output.**
