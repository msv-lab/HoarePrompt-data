The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`. `path` is a non-empty string that represents a file system path, starting with at least one '/' character and containing only lowercase Latin letters and '/' characters. The length of `path` does not exceed 100 characters. The function processes this input and, based on its logic (not described in detail), it will return a specific output related to the input path. However, the exact nature of the output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-empty string `path` that represents a file system path and return an output based on that path.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string path representing a file system path and returns an output based on that path.**
