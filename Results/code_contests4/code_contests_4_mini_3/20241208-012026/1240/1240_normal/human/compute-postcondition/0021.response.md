Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 and `flag` is 0. If `a` is equal to '/', then `flag` is changed to 1. If `a` is equal to '\n', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a` is not equal to '/' or '\n', `count` is set to 1 and the value of `a` is written to standard output.***
