Functionality: ** The function reads characters from standard input one at a time until it encounters a newline character. It counts the number of non-newline characters read. If it encounters a '/' character, it ensures that only one '/' is printed in sequence, regardless of how many are read consecutively. If no non-newline characters are read before the newline, it outputs a single '/'. The function does not accept any parameters and primarily interacts with standard input and output. **
