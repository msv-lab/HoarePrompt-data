The value of `flag` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `flag` was `0`, so now `flag` changes from `0` to `1`. The other variables `count` and `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `flag` is 1, `a` is an input character from stdin.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `flag` is 1, `a` is an input character from stdin**
