Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 and `flag` is 0. If `a` is '/', then `flag` is set to 1 if it was initially 0, and `count` remains 0. If `flag` was not 0, then both `count` and `flag` stay unchanged with `a` still being the input character. Otherwise, if `a` is a newline character, execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not a newline, `count` is updated to 1, `flag` is reset to 0, and the character `a` is written to stdout.***
