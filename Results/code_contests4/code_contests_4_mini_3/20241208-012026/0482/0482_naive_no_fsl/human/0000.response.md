To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the size of the array `n` and the threshold `k`, followed by the array of integers. This part seems to be correctly implemented.

2. **Count Calculation for k = 1**: The program has a special case when `k == 1`, where it calculates the total number of subarrays directly using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This is correct because every subarray has at least one element, which satisfies the condition of having at least one equal number.

3. **Count Calculation for k > 1**:
   - The program initializes a dictionary `d` to keep track of the indices of occurrences of each integer in the array.
   - It also maintains a variable `leftmost` to track the leftmost index of valid subarrays.
   - For each element in the array, if the element has been seen before, it updates its index list in the dictionary.
   - If the length of this index list reaches `k`, it checks if the `k-th` occurrence is to the right of the `leftmost` index. If so, it updates `leftmost`.
   - The count of valid subarrays is incremented by `leftmost + 1` for each position in the array.

4. **Potential Issue**: The main issue with this implementation arises from the way it updates the count. The condition `if dvalk > leftmost` is supposed to ensure that the `k-th` occurrence is valid, but it does not correctly account for all subarrays that can be formed with `k` occurrences. Specifically:
   - It might miss counting valid subarrays when the same value appears in a non-contiguous manner.
   - The calculation of the number of valid subarrays does not seem to fully account for all combinations that include `k` or more equal numbers, especially when there are multiple occurrences of numbers that can overlap.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5 2
1 2 1 2 1
```
The valid subarrays with at least 2 equal numbers should include:
- (1, 2, 1)
- (2, 1, 2)
- (1, 2, 1, 2)
- (1, 2, 1, 2, 1)
- (1, 1)
- (2, 1, 2)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 1)
- (1, 1)

In total, there are more valid subarrays than what the current logic would count.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning and the identified issue, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
