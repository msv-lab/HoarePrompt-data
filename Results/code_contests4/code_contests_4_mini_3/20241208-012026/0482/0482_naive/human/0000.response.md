To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the specified problem description, we will analyze the program's logic and how it handles the requirements. 

The problem requires counting the number of subarrays with at least `k` equal numbers in an array of integers.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n` and `k`, as well as the array of integers. This part seems correct.
  
2. **Count Calculation**:
   - If `k == 1`, it calculates the total number of subarrays using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This is correct since every subarray will have at least one of its elements.
   
   - For `k > 1`, the program uses a dictionary to track the indices of occurrences of each number. It then checks if the count of occurrences reaches `k`. If it does, it updates the `leftmost` index of the `k-th` occurrence and adds to the count based on this index.

3. **Logic for Counting Valid Subarrays**:
   - The logic for counting valid subarrays depends on correctly maintaining the `leftmost` index and ensuring that it counts all valid subarrays ending at the current index.
   - The program adds `leftmost + 1` to `count`, which represents all indices from 0 to `leftmost` that can form valid subarrays with the current index `i`.

### Potential Issue
1. **Edge Case with Non-Unique Integers**:
   - Consider the input: 
     ```
     5 2
     1 1 2 2 1
     ```
   - The expected valid subarrays containing at least two equal numbers are:
     - (1,1)
     - (1,1,2)
     - (1,2,2)
     - (2,2)
     - (2,1)
     - (1,1,2,2)
     - (1,1,2,2,1)
   - The expected count is 7, but the logic used in the program might miss counting some valid subarrays due to how it manages `leftmost`.

2. **Off-by-One Error**:
   - The calculation of `count` via `leftmost + 1` could potentially lead to an off-by-one error because it might add extra counts in certain scenarios where `leftmost` does not properly reflect the starting point of valid subarrays.

### Conclusion
Given these analyses and the potential issues identified with the handling of counts and edge cases, we can conclude that the program does not correctly implement the solution for all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails in specific cases where the distribution of numbers results in missed subarray counts.
