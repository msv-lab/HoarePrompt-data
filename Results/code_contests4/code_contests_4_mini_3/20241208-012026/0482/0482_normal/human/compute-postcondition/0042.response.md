Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `k` is updated to the second value from input. If `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`, and `count` remains 0. The array `vals` has at least 2 elements, `val` is the second value in `vals`, `i` is 1; `d[val]` is updated by appending `i` to it; `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`; `dvalk` is assigned the value from `dval` at index -k. Otherwise, no changes are made to `leftmost`, `count`, `vals`, `val`, `i`, `d`, `dval`, or `dvalk`.***
