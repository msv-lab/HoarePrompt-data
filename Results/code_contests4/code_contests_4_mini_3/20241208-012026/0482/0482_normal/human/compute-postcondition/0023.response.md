Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is 0, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 0, and `val` is the first entry in `vals`. If `val` is a key in the dictionary `d`, then if the length of the list `d[val]` is less than `k`, the program remains in its initial state. Otherwise, `leftmost` is updated to `dval[k]`, which is greater than the original `leftmost`, and `i` and `val` remain unchanged. If `val` is not a key in `d`, then `d` is updated to include `{val: [0]}` while all other variables remain unchanged.***
