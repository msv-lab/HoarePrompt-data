The `pass` statement does not change the values of any variables, nor does it affect the flow of the program. The state of all variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is 0, `d` has `val` as a key with its corresponding list, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 0, `val` is the first entry in `vals`, `dval` is the list found in `d[val]`, and the length of `dval` is less than `k`.
