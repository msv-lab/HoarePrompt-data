In the provided code snippet, `d[val]` is being assigned the value `[i]`. Here, `val` is the second value in `vals`, and `i` is currently `1`. This assignment indicates that the key `val` in the dictionary `d` will now hold a list containing the single element `1`. The previous states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is updated to `0`, `leftmost` is -1, `vals` must have at least 2 elements, `val` is the second value in `vals`, `i` is 1, and `d[val]` is assigned the value `[1]`.**
