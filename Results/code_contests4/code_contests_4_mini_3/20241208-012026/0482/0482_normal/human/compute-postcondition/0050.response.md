The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 400,000\).
- `k` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1,000,000,000\).

Based on the output conditions provided, the functionality of the function is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the function performs some operations involving the parameters and returns a specific result based on those operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the list, `k` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.**
