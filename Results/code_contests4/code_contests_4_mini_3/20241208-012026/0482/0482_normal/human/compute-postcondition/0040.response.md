The statement `dvalk = dval[-k]` assigns the value from the list `dval` at the index `-k` to `dvalk`. The variable `k` is updated to the second value from input, which is guaranteed to be valid since `n` is greater than 0 and `vals` has at least 2 elements. 

Given that `dval` is derived from `d[val]`, it is assumed that `dval` has enough elements to access `-k`. The value of `dvalk` will thus be the element at the index `-k` of `dval`.

Since `k` represents a valid index, this means `dval` must have at least `k` elements to avoid any IndexError. 

The output state reflects that `dvalk` has been successfully assigned a value based on the defined conditions.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is 0, `leftmost` is -1, `vals` must have at least 2 elements, `val` is the second value in `vals`, `i` is 1; `d[val]` is updated by appending `i` to it; `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`; `dvalk` is assigned the value from `dval` at index -k.**
