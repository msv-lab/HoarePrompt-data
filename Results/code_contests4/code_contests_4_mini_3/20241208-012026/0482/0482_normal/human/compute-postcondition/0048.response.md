Postcondition: ***`n` is updated to the first value from input and remains a positive integer. If `k` is equal to 1, `count` is calculated as `n * (n + 1) / 2`. If `k` is greater than 1, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is the total accumulated value based on `leftmost`, where `leftmost` is the maximum index of the last `k` occurrences of any value in `vals` or -1 if no such occurrences exist, `d` holds a mapping of values to their indices in `vals`, and `vals` is a map of the first `n` integers from input.***
