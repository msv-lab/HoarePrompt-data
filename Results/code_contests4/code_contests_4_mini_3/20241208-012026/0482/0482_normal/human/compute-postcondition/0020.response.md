Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is 0, `d` has `val` as a key with its corresponding list, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 0, `val` is the first entry in `vals`, and `dval` is the list found in `d[val]`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, the program remains in its initial state. Otherwise, `leftmost` is updated to `dval[k]`, which is greater than the original `leftmost`, and `i` and `val` remain unchanged.***
