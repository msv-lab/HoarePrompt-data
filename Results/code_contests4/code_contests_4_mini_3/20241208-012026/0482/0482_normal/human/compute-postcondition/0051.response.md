Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` positive integers. If `k` is 1, it calculates and prints the sum of the first `n` integers. If `k` is greater than 1, it counts the number of valid indices based on the last `k` occurrences of each integer in the list, accumulating these counts and printing the total. The function also handles the case when `k` is larger than the number of occurrences of a value, but it does not explicitly address cases where `n` is 0 or where no valid occurrences exist for any value, leading to potential inaccuracies in the output.**
