Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is updated to `leftmost + 1`, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 1, `val` is the second entry in `vals`, and `d[val]` is updated to include `i`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, `dval` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `leftmost` is updated to `dvalk`, `dval` is reassigned with the updated value of `d[val]`, and `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval` at index `-k`, provided that `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost`.***
