Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is updated to 0, `leftmost` remains -1 if `len(dval)` is less than `k`. If `len(dval)` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `dval[k]` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to `dval[k]`, while `count` remains 0. The array `vals` has at least 2 elements, `val` is the second value in `vals`, `i` is 1; `d[val]` is updated by appending `i` to it, and `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. If `len(dval) >= k`, then `dvalk` is assigned the value from `dval` at index -k. Otherwise, no changes occur to `leftmost`, `count`, `vals`, `val`, `i`, `d`, `dval`, or `dvalk`.***
