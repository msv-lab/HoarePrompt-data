`d[val]` is assigned a list containing the value `[i]`, where `i` is 0. Since `val` is not currently a key in the dictionary `d`, this assignment will create a new key-value pair in `d` with `val` as the key and `[i]` (which is `[0]`) as the corresponding value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is 0, `d` now contains `{val: [0]}`, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 0, `val` is the first entry in `vals`, and `val` is not a key in the dictionary `d` before this operation.
