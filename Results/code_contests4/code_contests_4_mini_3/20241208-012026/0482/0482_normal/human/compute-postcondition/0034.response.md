Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is updated to `leftmost + 1`, and `leftmost` is -1. If `val` is in `d`, then `d[val]` is updated to include `i`, and if the length of `d[val]` is less than `k`, `dval` remains unchanged; otherwise, `leftmost` is updated to `dval[k]`, `dval` is reassigned with the updated value of `d[val]`, and `dval[k]` is assigned the value of `dval` at index `-k`, provided that `dval[k]` is greater than `leftmost`. If `val` is not in `d`, then `d[val]` is assigned the list containing `i`, which is 1.***
