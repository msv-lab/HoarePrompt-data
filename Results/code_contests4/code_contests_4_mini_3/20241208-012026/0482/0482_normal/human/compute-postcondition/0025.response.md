According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `vals` list and the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `vals`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `vals` has at least one entry since `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the `vals` list must have at least 2 entries.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is updated to `leftmost + 1`, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 1, and `val` is the second entry in `vals`, for the loop to execute a second time `vals` must have at least 2 entries.**
