The value of `dvalk` is assigned the value from the list `dval`, specifically the element at the index `-k`. The variable `k` is updated to the second value from input, and `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. Since `dval` is a list, `dval[-k]` retrieves the `k`-th element from the end of the list. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is updated to `leftmost + 1`, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 1, `val` is the second entry in `vals`, `d[val]` is updated to include `i`, and `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval` at index `-k`.**
