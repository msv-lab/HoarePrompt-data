The variable `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`. The value of `dvalk` is determined by the value of `dval`, which was previously assigned as `d[val]`, and `dvalk` is accessing the value from `dval` at index `-k`. The previous state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `k` has been updated to a valid integer, and `vals` has at least 2 elements, ensuring that `val` and `d[val]` are valid. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in the value of `leftmost`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is 0, `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`, `vals` must have at least 2 elements, `val` is the second value in `vals`, `i` is 1; `d[val]` is updated by appending `i` to it; `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`; `dvalk` is assigned the value from `dval` at index -k.**
