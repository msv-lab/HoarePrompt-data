Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, and `count` is updated to 0. `leftmost` remains -1 if `len(dval) < k`. If `len(dval) >= k` and `dval[k] > leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to `dval[k]`. `d[val]` is updated by appending `i` to it, and `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. If `len(dval) >= k`, then `dvalk` is assigned the value from `dval` at index -k. If `val` is not in `d`, then `d[val]` is assigned the value `[1]` without any changes to `leftmost`, `count`, `vals`, `val`, `i`, or `dval`.***
