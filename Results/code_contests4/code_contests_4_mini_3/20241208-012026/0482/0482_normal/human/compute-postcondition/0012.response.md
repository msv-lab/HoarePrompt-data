The variable `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, which means it retrieves the list associated with the key `val` in the dictionary `d`. The value of `d[val]` depends on the previous state of the dictionary `d`, which contains `val` as a key and has been updated to include `i` in its list. 

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `count`, `leftmost`, and `i`) remain unchanged during this operation. Thus, we can summarize the output state based on the retrieval of `d[val]` and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to the second value from input, `count` is 0, `d` has `val` as a key with its corresponding list, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 0, `val` is the first entry in `vals`, `dval` is the list found in `d[val]`.**
