To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the logic and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have three logos represented by rectangles defined by their width and height.
2. We need to determine if we can fit these three logos onto a square billboard without overlapping and without leaving any empty space.
3. The logos can be rotated, meaning we can swap width and height.

### Program Logic:
The program defines a function `func_1` that checks various configurations of the logos to see if they fit into a square billboard. It checks several specific cases based on the heights and widths of the logos and attempts to print the arrangement if possible.

### Potential Issues:
1. The function does not comprehensively check every possible arrangement of the three logos.
2. It checks only a limited set of conditions and orientations, which may not cover all configurations that could potentially fit on a billboard.
3. The program assumes that if one arrangement fails, it moves on to check another but doesn't ensure that all combinations of logo placements are validated.

### Example Case to Test:
Consider the logos with dimensions:
- Logo A: 1x2
- Logo B: 2x1
- Logo C: 2x1

In this case, the logos can be arranged as follows on a 2x2 billboard:
```
AA
BB
```
However, the program may not correctly identify this arrangement because it has a limited set of checks and does not evaluate all combinations.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not account for all possible arrangements of the logos and can fail for certain configurations, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle various arrangements comprehensively, leading to potential cases where valid configurations are missed.
