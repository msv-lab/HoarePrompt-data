To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires placing three logos on a square billboard without overlapping and without leaving any empty space. The program attempts to evaluate several configurations by making comparisons and checking if the logos can fit on a square billboard.

However, the program implementation does not cover all possible configurations adequately. For example, it only checks specific arrangements and does not account for all potential orientations and placements of the logos. 

One potential case where the program can fail is if we have the following input:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
In this case, the logos are all 1x1 rectangles. The output should allow a square of side 3 (3x3) to be filled completely with the letters A, B, and C in a 3x3 grid:
```
AAA
BBB
CCC
```
However, the logic in `func_1` does not accommodate this scenario since it checks for specific dimensions and arrangements that do not cover all cases. 

Additionally, the logic primarily focuses on specific pairings and does not explore all combinations, which could lead to missing valid configurations. 

Hence, the program does not ensure that all cases are accounted for, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is incomplete.

Correctness: **False**.
