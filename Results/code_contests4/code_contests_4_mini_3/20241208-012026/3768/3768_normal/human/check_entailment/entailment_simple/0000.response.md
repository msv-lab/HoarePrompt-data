Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Logic for Fitting Logos**: The program uses several if-conditions to check specific configurations for placing the logos. However, it does not comprehensively check all possible arrangements of the logos on the billboard. The problem description states that the logos can be rotated and must fit without leaving empty space, but the program does not account for all configurations or the possibility of the logos being placed in different orientations.

2. **Output Format**: The program attempts to print the output in a specific format based on the conditions checked, but it does not ensure that the output always reflects a valid filled square billboard without empty spaces. The requirement is to fill the billboard completely with logos and not produce any empty space, which is not guaranteed by the existing logic.

3. **Missing Cases**: There are scenarios that are not handled by the current `if` structure. For instance, it does not evaluate if the total area of the logos \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) exactly matches the area of a square billboard of side \(n\). The program also does not account for cases where the logos might fit in a different arrangement.

4. **Inconsistent Return Values**: The return values indicating whether the arrangement is possible (`True` or `False`) do not align with the output requirements (printing `-1` for impossible arrangements), leading to a misunderstanding of the function's purpose.

5. **Unclosed Parentheses**: There are syntax issues such as unclosed parentheses in the print statements, which would lead to runtime errors.

Due to these issues, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description, leading to an incorrect implementation.
