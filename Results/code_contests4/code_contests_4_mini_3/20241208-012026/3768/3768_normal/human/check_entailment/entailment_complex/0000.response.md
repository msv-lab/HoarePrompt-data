Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the main issues identified:

1. **Placement Logic**: The logic for placing the logos on the billboard is incomplete and does not consider all possible arrangements. The problem description states that the logos can be placed in various configurations on a square billboard, but the program only checks a few specific conditions and fails to comprehensively cover all scenarios.

2. **Square Billboard Dimension**: The problem requires that the logos completely fill a square billboard with no empty space left. However, the program does not calculate the total area needed for the logos or ensure that it can fit them into a square configuration. It only checks for specific relationships between the dimensions, which may not guarantee a successful arrangement.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the dimensions of the square billboard when conditions are met, but it does not correctly format the output according to the requirements. The arrangement of letters representing the logos may not yield a valid filled square without gaps or overlaps since the logic for printing them is not robust.

4. **Return Values**: The program contains return statements but does not handle the case where it is impossible to fit the logos (i.e., it should return -1 in such cases). The final return of `False` does not align with the problem's requirements.

In summary, the program fails to correctly implement the conditions necessary to determine if the logos can be placed on a square billboard without overlapping or leaving empty space, leading to the conclusion that it does not meet the problem requirements.
