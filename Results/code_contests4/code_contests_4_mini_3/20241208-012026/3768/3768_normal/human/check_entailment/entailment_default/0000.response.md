To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description and output hints, let's analyze both aspects step by step.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem asks us to determine if three logos can fit perfectly on a square billboard without overlapping and without leaving any empty space. Each logo can be rotated, and we need to check various configurations of the logos to find a valid arrangement. 

### Provided Code Analysis
The program reads the dimensions of three logos and checks various configurations using a function `func_1`. 

1. The function checks specific relationships between the dimensions of the logos based on their height and width.
2. It prints the size of the billboard and the configurations of logos based on the matched conditions.
3. If no configuration fits, it returns `-1`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Size Logos**: If all logos are the smallest possible size of 1x1, it should be checked if they can fit on a 3x3 billboard without overlapping.
2. **Non-Rectangular Configurations**: The code should ensure that even if the logos are configured in certain ways, the total area covered must be equal to the area of the square billboard.
3. **Rotation Handling**: The function checks some rotations, but it might not cover all possible configurations exhaustively.

### Output Hints Analysis
According to the output hints:
- The function checks for specific relationships between the logo dimensions and prints configurations when conditions are met.
- It does not handle cases where the input might be invalid or not strictly positive integers.

### Conclusion on Correctness
- The logic in the code does not cover all possible arrangements and configurations of the logos that could fit into a square billboard; it primarily checks a few specific scenarios.
- The output hints state that certain relationships are checked, but if none of the conditions are met, it might return false without checking for all configurations.
  
### Final Assessment
Given the analysis, especially regarding the lack of exhaustive checking for all arrangements and the behavior of handling input, we can conclude that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Reason**: The program does not check all possible logo arrangements and rotations, leading to cases where valid configurations are not considered. For example, if logo dimensions are such that they could fit in a different arrangement that the code does not currently check, the program will incorrectly return `-1`.
