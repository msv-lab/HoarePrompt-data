Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100) representing the dimensions of the logos for three companies. If the height of logo A (ya) is less than the height of logo B (yb), then it is not the case that `xa` is equal to `xc` and `ya + yc` is equal to `yb`.***
