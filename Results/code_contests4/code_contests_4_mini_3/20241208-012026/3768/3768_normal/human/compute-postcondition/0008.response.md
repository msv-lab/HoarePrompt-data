Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100) representing the dimensions of the logos for three companies. The height of logo A (ya) is equal to the height of logo B (yb). It is not the case that `xa` is equal to `xc` and `ya + yc` is equal to `yb. The sum of the widths of logos A and B is equal to the width of logo C (xa + xb = xc), and the sum of the heights of logos A and C is equal to the height of logo C (ya + yc = xc).***
