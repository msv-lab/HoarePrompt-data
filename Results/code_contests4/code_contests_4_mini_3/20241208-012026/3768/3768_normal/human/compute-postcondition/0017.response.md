Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100) representing the dimensions of the logos for three companies. The height of logo A (ya) is equal to the height of logo B (yb). It is not the case that `xa + xb` is equal to `xc` or `ya + yc` is equal to `yb`. Additionally, at least one of the following is true: `xa + xb` is not equal to `xc` or `ya + yc` is not equal to `yb`. Furthermore, it is true that `ya` is not equal to `yc` or `xa + xb + xc` is not equal to `yc`.***
