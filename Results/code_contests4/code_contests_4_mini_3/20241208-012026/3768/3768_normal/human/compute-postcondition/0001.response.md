Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100). The size of logo A is (xa, ya), the size of logo B is (xb, yb), the size of logo C is (xc, yc), and the height of logo A (ya) is less than the height of logo B (yb). Additionally, `xa` is equal to `xc` and the sum of `ya` and `yc` is equal to `yb`.***
