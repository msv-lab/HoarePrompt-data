Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers. The height of logo A (ya) is greater than the height of logo B (yb). `xb` is equal to `xc`, and the sum of the height of logo B (yb) and the height of logo C (yc) is equal to the height of logo A (ya). If the height of logo A (ya) is equal to the height of logo B (yb), then it is not the case that `xa + xb` is equal to `xc` and `ya + yc` is equal to `yb`. At least one of the following is true: `xa + xb` is not equal to `xc` or `ya + yc` is not equal to `yb`. Additionally, it is true that `ya` is not equal to `yc` or `xa + xb + xc` is not equal to `yc`.***
