The code `print(yb)` outputs the value of `yb`. The previous state indicates that `ya + yc = yb`, and since `ya` and `yc` are positive integers, `yb` is determined by the sum of these two values. However, since we do not have specific values for `ya` and `yc`, we can only state the relationship.

The output state will reflect that `yb` is printed based on that relationship.

Output State: **`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers; `ya + yc = yb`, and `print(yb)` outputs the value of `yb`.**
