Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers. The height of logo A (ya) is greater than the height of logo B (yb), `xb` is not equal to `xc`, and `yb + yc` is equal to `ya`. At least one of the following is true: `xa + xb` is equal to `xc` or `ya + yc` is not equal to `yb`. It holds that `ya` is not equal to `yc` or `xa + xb + xc` is equal to `yc`. Additionally, `xa` is equal to `xb`. Furthermore, `xc` is equal to `xa` and `ya + yb + yc` is equal to `xa`.***
