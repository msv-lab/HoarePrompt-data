Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid triples (i, j, k) such that `ai·aj·ak` is minimized. 

### Issues with the program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Product**: The program sorts the array and then selects the third element (after the first two minimums) to determine the minimum product. However, it does not properly consider all possible combinations of three elements that could yield the minimum product. The minimum product is not necessarily formed by the three smallest distinct values; it could also come from the scenario where the smallest values are repeated.

2. **Counting Only the Last Element**: The loop is counting how many times the third element (after sorting) occurs in the list, which is incorrect. The program fails to consider how to actually form the triples from the indices of these elements.

### Example where it fails:
Consider the input:
```
n = 5
a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
```
The minimum product here is `1 * 1 * 2 = 2`, and the valid index triples are:
- (0, 1, 2)
- (0, 1, 3)
- (0, 1, 4)
- (1, 0, 2)
- (1, 0, 3)
- (1, 0, 4)
- (2, 0, 1)
- (3, 0, 1)
- (4, 0, 1)
- (2, 1, 4)
- (3, 1, 4)
- (4, 1, 2)
- (4, 1, 3)
- (2, 3, 4)
- (3, 2, 4)

There are a total of 10 valid triples, which the current program does not account for correctly. 

Thus, the program is incorrect.
