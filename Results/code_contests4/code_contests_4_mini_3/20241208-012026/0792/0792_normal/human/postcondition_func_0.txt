The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list and counts how many times the third smallest element occurs consecutively starting from the fourth element in the sorted list. It then prints this count. If there are fewer than four elements that are equal to the third smallest element, it will return a count of 1 if it exists, or 0 if it does not.
