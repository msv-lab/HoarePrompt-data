`x` is assigned the value of the third element in the list `a`, which is accessed using `a[2]`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers from input and `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, it implies that `a` has at least three elements. The output state will reflect the assignment of `x`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the sorted list of integers from input; `x` is the third element of the list `a`.**
