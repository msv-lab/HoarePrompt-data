The variable `ans` is initialized with the value 1. The states of the other variables `n`, `a`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the sorted list of integers from input; `x` is the third element of the list `a`; `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the sorted list of integers from input; `x` is the third element of the list `a`; `ans` is 1**
