The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` does not change, and the contents of `a` are updated to be in sorted order. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new state of `a` after sorting, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the sorted list of integers from input.**
