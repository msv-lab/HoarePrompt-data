The value of `a` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which will convert a line of input (split by spaces) into integers. However, since the specific input is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values that `a` will hold. The previous values of `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers from input.**
