The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 5 elements, `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `i` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
