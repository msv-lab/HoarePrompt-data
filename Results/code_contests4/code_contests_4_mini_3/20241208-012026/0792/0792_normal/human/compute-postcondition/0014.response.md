Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 5 elements; `x` is the third element of the list `a`; `i` is 4. If `a[i]` equals `x`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
