The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 5 elements; `x` is the third element of the list `a`; `i` is 5, and we break out of the loop.
