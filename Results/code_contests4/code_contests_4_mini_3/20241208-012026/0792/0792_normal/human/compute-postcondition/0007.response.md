`ans` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `ans` is 1, the new value of `ans` becomes 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 3, and the element at index `i` of list `a` is equal to `x`.
