The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the logic defined within the function. However, the exact return value is not specified in the given output. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a` within the defined constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list a of n positive integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).**
