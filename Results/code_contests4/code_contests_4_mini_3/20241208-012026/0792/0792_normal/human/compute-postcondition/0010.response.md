Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, and `x` is the third element of the list `a`. If the element at index `i` (which is 3) of list `a` is equal to `x`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, if the element at index `i` is not equal to `x`, `ans` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
