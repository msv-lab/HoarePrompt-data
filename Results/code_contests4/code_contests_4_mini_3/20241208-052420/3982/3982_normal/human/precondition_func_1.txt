n is an integer representing the number of robbers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), m is an integer representing the number of searchlights (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), and each robber's coordinates (a_i, b_i) and each searchlight's coordinates (c_j, d_j) are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6 for all valid i and j.
