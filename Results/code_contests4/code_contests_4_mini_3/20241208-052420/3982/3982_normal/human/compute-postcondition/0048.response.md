According to the code, the loop iterates over the `lights` collection. Since `lights` contains at least one light, the loop has executed at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `lx` and `ly` represent the coordinates of the first light in `lights`. For the loop to execute again, it must move to the next light in the collection. 

Given that `lights` has at least one light, and since we don't know how many lights are in the collection, the loop can continue as long as there are remaining lights. 

If the loop has executed once, it means that the first light's coordinates have been assigned to `lx` and `ly`. To execute the loop a second time, the next light's coordinates will be assigned to `lx` and `ly`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop is now working with the next light in the `lights` collection.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `lights` contains at least one light, `lx` and `ly` are the coordinates of the next light in `lights`.**
