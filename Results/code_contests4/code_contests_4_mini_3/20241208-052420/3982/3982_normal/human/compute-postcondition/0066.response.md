The value of `avail[i]` is assigned the value `0`, and since `i` is `0`, `avail[0]` is set to `0`. The previous state of `avail` is a list initialized with zeros, so there is no change in the value of `avail[0]`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, `ans` is 500000, and `i` is 0; `avail[0]` is now 0 (unchanged).

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, `ans` is 500000, and `i` is 0; `avail[0]` is now 0 (unchanged)**.
