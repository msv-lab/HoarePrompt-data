Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is either 0 or 500001, `r` is either 500000 or 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is either 0 or not equal to 0, and `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, the values of `l`, `r`, `avail`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `psum_min`, and `psum` remain unchanged. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, then `l` is updated to 500001, and the values of `r`, `avail`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `psum_min`, and `psum` remain unchanged.***
