The value of `ep` is defined as `min(500000, x)`, and from the initial state, we know that `x` can take a value such that `ep` is less than `ans`, which is `500000`. Therefore, `ep` will be a value between 0 and 500000. 

The code snippet decrements `avail[ep + 1]` by 1. Since `ep` is less than `ans`, we can assume `ep + 1` will be a valid index in the `avail` list.

The initial state indicates that `avail` is a list of size `1000002` initialized to `0`. Therefore, after executing the line `avail[ep + 1] -= 1`, the value at index `ep + 1` will be reduced by 1, but the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0 except avail[ep + 1] which is decremented by 1, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 0, `x` is `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[0]`, `sp` is either `500000 - y` or 0, `ep` is min(500000, x)**.
