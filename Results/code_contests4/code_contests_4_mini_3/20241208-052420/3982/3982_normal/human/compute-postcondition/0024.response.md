According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` collection. For the loop to execute, `lights` must contain at least one element, as it iterates over the pairs `(lx, ly)` in `lights`. 

The states provided:
- `n` is between 1 and 2000 (not directly affecting the loop execution).
- `m` is between 1 and 2000 (not directly affecting the loop execution).
- `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber (not directly affecting the loop execution).
- `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are derived from the `lights`, ensuring that they contain non-negative values, but do not indicate the existence of elements in `lights`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the essential condition is that `lights` must not be empty. Therefore:

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry`, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` contains at least one element (lx, ly)**
