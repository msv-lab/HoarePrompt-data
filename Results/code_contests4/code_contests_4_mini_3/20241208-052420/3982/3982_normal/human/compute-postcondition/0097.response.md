To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is between 1 and 2000.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is 1000001.
   - `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`.
   - `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`.
   - `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`.
   - `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `avail[sp] += 1` increments the value at index `sp` in the `avail` list by 1.

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `sp` is determined by the expression `max(0, ans - y)`. Since `ans` and `y` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `sp`, but it will be either:
     - `sp = ans - y`, if `ans - y` is positive.
     - `sp = 0`, if `ans - y` is negative or zero.
   - Therefore, `avail[sp]` will be incremented by 1, affecting the value at that specific index in the `avail` list.

4. **Output State Description:**
   - Since we cannot determine the exact values of `sp`, `ans`, or `y`, we express the output state with respect to the variable changes and conditions:
   - The `avail` list is modified at index `sp`, leading to `avail[sp]` being increased by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`, `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x)**.
