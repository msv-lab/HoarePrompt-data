The code initializes `rel_lights_x` as an empty list. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `robbers`, and `lights` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `robbers` is the value returned by `func_4(n, 2)`; `lights` is the value returned by `func_4(m, 2)`; `rel_lights_x` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `robbers` is the value returned by `func_4(n, 2)`; `lights` is the value returned by `func_4(m, 2)`; `rel_lights_x` is an empty list.**
