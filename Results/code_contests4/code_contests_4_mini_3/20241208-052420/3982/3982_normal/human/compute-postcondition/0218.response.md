The value of `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`INF`) and `psum` (which is `ax`). Since `ax` is the first element in `avail`, it is a specific value. Therefore, `psum_min` is updated to `min(INF, ax)`, which will be `ax` itself, as `ax` is less than `INF`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`psum` is `ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 1 element, `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
