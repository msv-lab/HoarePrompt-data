`rel_lights_x` is a collection that is being appended with the value of `x`. Since `x` is defined as `lx - rx` and both `lx` and `rx` are specific values that ensure `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the value being appended is valid. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `lights` contains at least one light, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first light in `lights`, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first light in `lights`, `x` and `y` are assigned values based on `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`, and `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`.
