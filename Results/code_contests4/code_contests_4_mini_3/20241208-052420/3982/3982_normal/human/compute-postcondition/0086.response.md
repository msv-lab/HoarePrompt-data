To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we need to determine the values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` in the calculation of `sp`.

Given:
- `ans` is 500000
- `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]` (the specific value of `rel_lights_x[1]` is unknown)
- `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]` (the specific value of `rel_lights_y[1]` is unknown)

The expression to evaluate is:
```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

Breaking it down:
1. Calculate `x + y - ans`. Since `ans` is 500000, this becomes `x + y - 500000`.
2. Then, compute `x - (x + y - 500000)` which simplifies to `x - x - y + 500000`, resulting in `500000 - y`.
3. Finally, `sp` will be computed as `max(0, 500000 - y)`.

Since `y` is unknown but is derived from `rel_lights_y[1]`, the output state reflects the range of possible values for `sp` based on the value of `y`.

Thus, the output state will indicate that `sp` is dependent on the value of `y`:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0 except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 1, `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is max(0, 500000 - y)**
