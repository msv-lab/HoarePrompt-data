According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than `r`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is 1000001. Since 0 is less than 1000001, the loop can execute. 

No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time because the current values of `l` and `r` already satisfy the condition.

State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, and `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0**
