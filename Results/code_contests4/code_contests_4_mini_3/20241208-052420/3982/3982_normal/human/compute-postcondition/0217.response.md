`psum` is incremented by `ax`. Given that the initial value of `psum` is 0 and `ax` is the first element in `avail`, the new value of `psum` becomes `0 + ax`, which is `ax`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum` is `ax`, `psum_min` is INF, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 1 element, and `ax` is the first element in `avail`.

Output State: **`psum` is `ax`, `psum_min` is INF, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 1 element, `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
