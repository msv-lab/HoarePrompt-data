According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. The loop iterates over each element in the `avail` list, and since it has at least 1 element, it has executed at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, which is between 1 and 2000, and `ax` is the current element from the list `avail`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ax` will take the next value from `avail`. Given that `avail` has a size of 1000002, if the loop has already executed for the first element, we can conclude that `ax` will be set to the next element in `avail`.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, the current state of `i` remains unchanged, and now `ax` will be the second element in the list `avail`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 2 elements, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to `min(INF, ax)`, `psum` is `ax`**
