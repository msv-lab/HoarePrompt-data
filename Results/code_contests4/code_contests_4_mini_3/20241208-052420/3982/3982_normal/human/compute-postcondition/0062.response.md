The code initializes the list `avail` with a size of \(10^6 + 1 + 1\), which is \(10^6 + 2\). This means `avail` will contain \(1,000,002\) elements, all initialized to `0`. The values of `n`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, and `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, and `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0.**
