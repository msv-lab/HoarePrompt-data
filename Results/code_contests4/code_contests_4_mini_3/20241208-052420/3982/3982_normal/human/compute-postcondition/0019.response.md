The code appends the value of `x` to the `rel_lights_x` collection. The value of `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`, where `lx` is the third element in `lights` and `rx` is not specified in the initial state but is assumed to be a relevant value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `robbers` is a non-empty collection; `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`; `rel_lights_y` includes the value of `y`; `lights` is a non-empty collection with at least 3 elements; `lx` is the third element in `lights`; `ly` is the third element in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `robbers` is a non-empty collection; `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`; `rel_lights_y` includes the value of `y`; `lights` is a non-empty collection with at least 3 elements; `lx` is the third element in `lights`; `ly` is the third element in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`.**
