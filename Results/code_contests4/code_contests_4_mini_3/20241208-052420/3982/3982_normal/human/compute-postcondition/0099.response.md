Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`, `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x). If `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
