To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the initial state and the loop code.

1. **Initial Variables**:
   - `psum_min` starts as `INF`.
   - `n` is between 1 and 2000, indicating that `avail` will have at least 1 element.
   - `ans` remains either 250000, 500000, or 750001.
   - `psum` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `ax` in the `avail` list.
   - During each iteration:
     - `psum` is incremented by the current value `ax`.
     - `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the current `psum`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - After all iterations, `psum` will equal the sum of all elements in `avail` since it's cumulatively adding each `ax`.
   - `psum_min` will be the smallest cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, which will be the minimum value of `psum` among all iterations.

Given that there are `n` elements in `avail`, the loop will execute `n` times. The output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is between 1 and 2000, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001.**
