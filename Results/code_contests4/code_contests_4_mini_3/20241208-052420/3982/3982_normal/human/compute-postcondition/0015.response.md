The value of `y` is appended to the `rel_lights_y` collection. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this action, and since `y` is already defined in the initial state as `y = ly - ry`, it retains its calculated value. Therefore, the output state reflects that `y` has been added to `rel_lights_y`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection, `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` now includes the value of `y`, `lights` is a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements, `lx` is the second element in `lights`, `ly` is the second element in `lights`, `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, and `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.**
