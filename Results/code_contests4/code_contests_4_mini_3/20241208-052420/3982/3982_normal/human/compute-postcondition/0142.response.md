To analyze the provided code snippet, we first need to understand the components involved:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is between 1 and 2000 (not specifically defined).
  - `i` is 1.
  - `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]` (value unknown).
  - `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]` (value unknown).
  
The computation performed by the code is:
```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

Given this, we can evaluate the expression:

1. `x + y` is computed, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not known.
2. `ans` is not defined in the initial state, making it impossible to evaluate `x + y - ans` directly.
3. The result of `x - (x + y - ans)` simplifies to `ans - y`, since `x` cancels out.
4. The `max(0, ans - y)` function determines `sp`. Since `ans` and `y` are unknown, we cannot specifically define `sp` either.

Since `sp` is dependent on the values of `ans` and `y`, we can only state that `sp` has been calculated, but its value remains unknown.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 1; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]; `sp` is calculated as max(0, ans - y) but its value is unknown.**
