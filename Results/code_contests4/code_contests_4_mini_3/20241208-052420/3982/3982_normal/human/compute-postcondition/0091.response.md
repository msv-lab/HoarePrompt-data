Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, and `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `sp` is dependent on the value of `y`, and `avail` is updated based on `sp`. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1; otherwise, there are no changes to `avail`.**
