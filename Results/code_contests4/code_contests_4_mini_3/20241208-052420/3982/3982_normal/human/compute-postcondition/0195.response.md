According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, and since `n` is at least 1, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is non-negative, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
