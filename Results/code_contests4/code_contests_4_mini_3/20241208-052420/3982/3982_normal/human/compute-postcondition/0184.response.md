According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 2000, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The state of `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The values of `psum`, `psum_min`, and `ans` do not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be initialized to 0, and `n` must be at least 1. 

State: **`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is non-negative, `i` is 0**
