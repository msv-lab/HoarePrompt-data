To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is between 1 and 2000.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is 1000001.
   - `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0 except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1.
   - `ans` is 500000.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]` (value not specified).
   - `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]` (value not specified).
   - `sp` is `max(0, 500000 - y)`.
   - `ep` is `min(500000, x)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The statement `avail[sp] += 1` means that 1 will be added to the index `sp` of the `avail` list.
   - The value of `sp` is determined by `max(0, 500000 - y)`. Since `y` is unknown, `sp` can either be `500000 - y` (if `500000 - y` is positive) or `0` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `500000`).
   - Therefore, `avail[sp]` will be incremented, affecting the `avail` list at the index corresponding to `sp`.

3. **Output State:**
   - Since `sp` is dependent on the unknown value of `y`, we describe the outcome based on the possible scenarios for `sp`.
   - The `avail` list is updated at index `sp`. If `sp` is a positive integer, then that specific index in the list is incremented by 1; if `sp` is 0, then `avail[0]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is updated at index `sp`, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 1, `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is `max(0, 500000 - y)`, `ep` is `min(500000, x)`**
