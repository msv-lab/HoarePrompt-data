The value of `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `psum`. Given that `psum` is `3 * ax` and `psum_min` is `ax`, we can compare these two values.

Since `psum_min` is `ax` and `psum` is `3 * ax`, we can determine that `3 * ax` is always greater than or equal to `ax` for non-negative values of `ax`. Thus, `min(ax, 3 * ax)` will always result in `ax`.

Therefore, `psum_min` remains `ax` after the execution of the code, and the states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`psum` is `3 * ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ax` is the third element in `avail`, and `psum_min` remains `ax`.**
