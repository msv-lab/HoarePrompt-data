Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, where `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`, `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1. In all cases, `i` remains 1, and `x` and `y` take the values from `rel_lights_x[1]` and `rel_lights_y[1]` respectively.***
