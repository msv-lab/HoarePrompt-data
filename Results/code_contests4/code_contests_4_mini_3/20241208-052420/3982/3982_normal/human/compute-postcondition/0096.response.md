To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we will analyze the variables involved.

- `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. This means that `ep` will take the lesser value between `ans` and `x`.
- The variable `ans` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
- The initial state indicates that `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`, but we do not have the specific value of `rel_lights_x[1]`.

Since we lack specific values for `ans` and `x`, we can only express the result in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ep` is assigned a minimum value based on the undetermined variables:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`, `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x)**
