The value of `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `psum`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `r`, `avail`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `psum`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 3 elements, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `psum`.
