The variable `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. Given that `i` is currently 1, `x` will take the value from the second element of the `rel_lights_x` list (considering indexing starts at 0). The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is non-negative, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`.
