The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`, where `ans` is a known value and `x` is also a known value derived from the previous state. The value of `ep` will be the lesser of `ans` or `x`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `y`, `sp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment and the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 0; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`; the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`; `sp` is assigned the value of max(0, x - (x + y - ans)); `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x)**
