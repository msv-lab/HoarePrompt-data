Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 0; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`. If the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `sp` is assigned the value of max(0, x - (x + y - ans)); `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x); `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1; if `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made in the program state.***
