The code appends the value of `x` to the list `rel_lights_x`. The initial state indicates that `x` is already assigned the value of `lx - rx` and that it is non-negative. Since `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx`, adding `x` to `rel_lights_x` does not change the non-negativity property of the values in the collection. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` has one more non-negative value, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry`, `x` is assigned the value of `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value of `ly - ry`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` has one more non-negative value, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry`, `x` is assigned the value of `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value of `ly - ry`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.**
