According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. For the loop to execute, `avail` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is between 1 and 2000, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop but may influence the content of `avail`. At the end of the last iteration, `psum` is 0, `psum_min` is INF, and `ans` is non-negative. 

For the loop to be executed, the list `avail` must contain at least one element. Assuming `ans` is non-negative, this means that the elements in `avail` from index 0 to `ans` should be properly defined and updated based on previous conditions.

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, `avail` should have at least one element, and `ax` should be the first element in the `avail` list.

State: **`psum` is 0, `psum_min` is INF, `ans` is non-negative, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` is a list with at least 1 element, and `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
