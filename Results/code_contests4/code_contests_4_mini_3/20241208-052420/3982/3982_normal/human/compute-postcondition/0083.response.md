According to the code, the loop's ability to execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is between 1 and 2000, the loop can execute at least once more. 

After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0 except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1, `ans` remains 500000, `i` is 1, while `x` is `rel_lights_x[0]` and `y` is `rel_lights_y[0]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
