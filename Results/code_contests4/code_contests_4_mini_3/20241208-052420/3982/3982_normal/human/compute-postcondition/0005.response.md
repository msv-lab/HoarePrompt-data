According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `robbers`. For the loop to execute, `robbers` must be a collection (like a list or a set) that contains at least one element (i.e., at least one robber). As stated, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are empty lists, which does not influence the execution of the for loop.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `robbers` contains at least one robber. Assuming `func_4(n, 2)` returns a list of tuples representing the positions of the robbers, we need to ensure that there is at least one tuple.

Thus, for the loop to be executed for the first time, `robbers` should not be empty. 

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection returned by `func_4(n, 2)` with at least one element, `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list**.
