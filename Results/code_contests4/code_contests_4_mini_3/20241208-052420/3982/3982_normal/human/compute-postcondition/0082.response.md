Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0 except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `ep` is min(500000, x), `sp` is either `500000 - y` or 0, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. `ans` remains 500000, `i` is 0, while `x` is `rel_lights_x[0]` and `y` is `rel_lights_y[0]`.***
