The code appends the value of `y` to the list `rel_lights_y`. Since `y` was previously assigned the value `ly - ry`, and given that `y` is greater than or equal to 0, the list `rel_lights_y` will now contain the value of `y`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection, `rel_lights_x` contains the value `x`, `rel_lights_y` now contains the value `y`, `lights` is a non-empty collection, `lx` is the first element in `lights`, `ly` is the first element in `lights`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection, `rel_lights_x` contains the value `x`, `rel_lights_y` now contains the value `y`, `lights` is a non-empty collection, `lx` is the first element in `lights`, `ly` is the first element in `lights`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.**
