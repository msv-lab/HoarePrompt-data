To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the line on the existing variables.

1. The variable `psum_min` is reassigned the minimum value between its current value (`psum_min`) and the value of `psum`.
2. The variable `psum` is calculated as `2 * ax`, where `ax` is previously defined but not provided in the initial state, so we treat it as a single variable.
3. Since we do not know the specific values of `ax`, we cannot determine the exact values of `psum` and thus cannot determine a specific value for `psum_min` after the operation.

Given that `psum_min` was originally `min(INF, ax)` and `psum` is `2 * ax`, the output state reflects that `psum_min` has been updated based on the comparison with `psum`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 2 elements, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `psum`, `psum` is `2 * ax`**.
