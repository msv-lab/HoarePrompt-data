`ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The values of `ans` and `x` are not specified, but `x` is derived from `rel_lights_x[2]`. Since `n` is between 1 and 2000 and `i` is 2, we can infer that `x` has a defined value. The output state reflects that `ep` will take the lesser of `ans` or `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 2; `x` is rel_lights_x[2]; `y` is rel_lights_y[2]; `sp` is assigned the value of max(0, x - (x + y - ans)); `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x).

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 2; `x` is rel_lights_x[2]; `y` is rel_lights_y[2]; `sp` is assigned the value of max(0, x - (x + y - ans)); `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x)**.
