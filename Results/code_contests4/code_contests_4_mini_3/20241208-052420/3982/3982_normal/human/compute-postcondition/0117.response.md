The variable `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. Given that `ans` is 500000, the new value for `l` becomes 500000 + 1, which is 500001. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 500001, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is not equal to 0, and `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 500001, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is not equal to 0, and `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail.**
