The value of `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. The variable `i` is 1, so `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`**
