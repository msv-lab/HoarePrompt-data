The variable `psum` is updated by adding the value of `ax` to its current value. Given that `psum` is initially `2 * ax`, after executing the code, the new value of `psum` will be `2 * ax + ax`, which simplifies to `3 * ax`. The values of `psum_min` and `ans` remain unchanged, and `avail` is not modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum` is `3 * ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `ax` is the third element in `avail`.

Output State: **`psum` is `3 * ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `ax` is the third element in `avail`.**
