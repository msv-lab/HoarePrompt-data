According to the code, the loop iterates over the `avail` list. For the loop to execute, `avail` must contain at least one element. Since `n` is between 1 and 2000, it implies that `avail` should have a size of `n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n >= 1`, which ensures that `avail` has at least one element.

At the start of the first iteration, the variable `ax` will be assigned the first element of the `avail` list. Since the `avail` list is based on the cumulative counts involving `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`, we assume that there is at least one valid entry calculated.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following states need to be established: `n` is at least 1, and `ax` is the first element of the `avail` list.

State: **`psum_min` is `INF`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `avail`**
