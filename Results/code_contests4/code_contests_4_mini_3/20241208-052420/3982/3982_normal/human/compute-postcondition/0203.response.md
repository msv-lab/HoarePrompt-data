Postcondition: ***`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is non-negative, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
