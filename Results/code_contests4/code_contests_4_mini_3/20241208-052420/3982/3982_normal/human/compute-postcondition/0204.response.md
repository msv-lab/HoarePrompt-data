According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 1, which means that for the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2.

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2, as `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is non-negative, `i` is 2, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`.**
