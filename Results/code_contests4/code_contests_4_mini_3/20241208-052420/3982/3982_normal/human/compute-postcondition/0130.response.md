In the given code, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 0. The value of `y` will be determined by accessing the first element of the `rel_lights_y` list (since indexing starts at 0). The variable `n` remains unaffected in this operation.

Since the initial state indicates that `n` is between 1 and 2000 and `i` is 0, we do not have specific values for `rel_lights_y`. Therefore, we can only conclude the effect of the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 0; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]**.
