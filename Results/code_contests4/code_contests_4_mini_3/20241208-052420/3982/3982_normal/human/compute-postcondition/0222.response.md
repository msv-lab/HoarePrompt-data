According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If the list has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` has at least 2 elements, and `ax` is currently the second element in `avail`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `avail` must have at least 3 elements, and `ax` must be updated to the third element in the list. 

State: **`psum` is `2 * ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `ax` is the third element in `avail`.**
