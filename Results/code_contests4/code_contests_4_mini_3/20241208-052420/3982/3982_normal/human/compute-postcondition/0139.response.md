According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is between 1 and 2000, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
