According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` collection. For the loop to execute at least once, `lights` must contain at least one element, which means it should not be empty. Given that `n` and `m` are integers and do not directly affect the loop's execution, we must focus on the `lights` collection.

Since `robbers` is confirmed to be non-empty and `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are empty lists, we need to ensure that the variable `lights` is defined and contains at least one element before the loop starts. 

Assuming the `lights` collection is derived from the `robbers` or some other logic that is not provided, we can denote that for the loop to execute:

- `lights` must be a non-empty collection.
- We can assume `lx` and `ly` will take the first element from `lights` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state would reflect that `lights` is a non-empty collection, and we can initialize `lx` and `ly` based on the first element of that collection.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection, `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` is a non-empty collection and `lx`, `ly` are the first elements in the lights collection.**
