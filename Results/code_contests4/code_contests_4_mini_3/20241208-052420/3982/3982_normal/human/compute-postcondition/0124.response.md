The code assigns the value 0 to `avail[i]`. The value of `i` is determined by the range of `ans`, which can be either 250001, 500001, or 750002. The value `avail` at the index `i` is updated to 0, but since `avail[0]` is already 0, the value at that index remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `l` is 0; `r` is either 500000 or 1000001; `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001; `avail[0]` is assigned the value 0; `avail[i]` is now 0 where `i` is either 250001, 500001, or 750002.**
