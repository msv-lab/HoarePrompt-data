The variable `psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`, which indicates a very large value typically used to represent infinity in algorithms. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `r`, `avail`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged, as this line only affects `psum_min`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with the final updates from the loop, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, and `psum_min` is set to `INF`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with the final updates from the loop, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to `INF`.**
