The variable `psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`, which is the first element in the list `avail`. The previous value of `psum` is `0`, so after executing the code, `psum` becomes `0 + ax`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 1 element, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to `INF`, `psum` is `ax`, where `ax` is the first element of `avail`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 1 element, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to `INF`, `psum` is `ax`**
