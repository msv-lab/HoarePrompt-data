The value of `x` is calculated as `lx - rx` and is assigned to `x`. The `rel_lights_x` collection, which already contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx`, now has the value of `x` appended to it. Since `x` is a non-negative value, the state of `rel_lights_x` is updated to include one more non-negative value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` and now includes `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry` with one more value which is `y`, `x` is assigned the value of `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value of `ly - ry`.**
