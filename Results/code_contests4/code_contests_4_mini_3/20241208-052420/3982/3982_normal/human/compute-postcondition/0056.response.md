The code appends the value of `y` to the list `rel_lights_y`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but `rel_lights_y` is modified to include the new value of `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`; `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`; `rel_lights_y` now includes the value of `y`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`; `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`; `rel_lights_y` now includes the value of `y`.**
