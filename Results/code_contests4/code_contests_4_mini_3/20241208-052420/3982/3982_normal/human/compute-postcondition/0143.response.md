The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The value of `x` is assigned from `rel_lights_x[1]`, while `ans` is an unknown value. The `min` function will return the smaller of the two values: `ans` or `x`. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 1; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]; `sp` is calculated as max(0, ans - y) but its value is unknown; `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x).

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 1; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]; `sp` is calculated as max(0, ans - y) but its value is unknown; `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x)**.
