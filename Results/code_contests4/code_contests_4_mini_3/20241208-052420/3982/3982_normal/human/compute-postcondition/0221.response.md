The value of `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `psum`. Given that `psum` is `2 * ax` and `psum_min` is currently `ax`, we need to compare `ax` and `2 * ax`. Since `2 * ax` is always greater than or equal to `ax` for non-negative values of `ax`, the minimum will be `ax`. Therefore, after executing the code, `psum_min` remains unchanged. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum` is `2 * ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `ax` is the second element in `avail`.

Output State: **`psum` is `2 * ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `ax` is the second element in `avail`.**
