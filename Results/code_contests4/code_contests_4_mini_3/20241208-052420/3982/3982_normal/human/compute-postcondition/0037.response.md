The code appends the value of `x` to the list `rel_lights_x`. The previous values of `rel_lights_x` are not specified, but after this operation, `x` will be included in `rel_lights_x`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry` with the value `y` included, and `y` is assigned the next value from `rel_lights_y`.
