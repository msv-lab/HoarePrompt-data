`psum` is incremented by `ax`, and since `psum` was previously `2 * ax`, after the execution, `psum` will be `2 * ax + ax`, which simplifies to `3 * ax`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `3 * ax`, `ax` is the third element of `avail`.

Output State: **`psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `3 * ax`, `ax` is the third element of `avail`**
