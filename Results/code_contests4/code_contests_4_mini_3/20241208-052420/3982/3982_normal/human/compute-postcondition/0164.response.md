The variable `psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`. Since `psum` was previously equal to `ax`, after the execution of the code, `psum` will now be `2 * ax`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `2 * ax`, `ax` is the second element of `avail`.

Output State: **`psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `2 * ax`, `ax` is the second element of `avail`**
