The `rel_lights_y` collection is modified by appending the value of `y` to it. The previous values of `rel_lights_y` and `y` are not specified, but since `y` has been calculated as `ly - ry`, it will have a specific value based on the current states of `ly` and `ry`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `robbers` is a non-empty collection; `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`; `rel_lights_y` now includes the value of `y` appended; `lights` is a non-empty collection with at least 3 elements; `lx` is the third element in `lights`; `ly` is the third element in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`**
