The variable `psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`. The value of `ax` is the third element in the list `avail`, but its specific value is not provided. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 3 elements, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is the minimum of its previous value and `psum`, `psum` is updated to `psum + ax`.
