According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `ans`. The current value of `i` is determined by the range defined in the loop, which extends from 0 to `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `ans`, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `ans + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `ans` must be at least 0, and the new value of `i` will be `ans + 1`.

State: **`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is between 1 and 2000, `ans` is non-negative, `avail[0]` is set to 0, for the loop to execute a second time i must be `ans + 1`.**
