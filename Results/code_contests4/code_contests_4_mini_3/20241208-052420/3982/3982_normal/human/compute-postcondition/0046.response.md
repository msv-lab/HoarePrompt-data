The `rel_lights_y` collection is updated with the value of `y`. The previous state of the variables indicates that `x` and `y` are calculated from the coordinates of the first light in `lights`, and we know that `rel_lights_x` already includes the value of `x`. The value of `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`, which means that the collection now contains at least one more element.

Since `rel_lights_y` is being modified but the exact previous contents of `rel_lights_y` are not provided, we can only state that `y` is added to it.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `lights` contains at least one light, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first light in `lights`, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first light in `lights`, `x` and `y` are assigned values based on `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`, `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x`, and `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.**
