The value of `psum` is incremented by `ax`. The previous value of `psum` is `ax` (as given), and since `psum` starts with `ax`, after the execution, `psum` will be `2 * ax`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 2 elements, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to `min(INF, ax)`, `psum` is `2 * ax`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 2 elements, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to `min(INF, ax)`, `psum` is `2 * ax`**
