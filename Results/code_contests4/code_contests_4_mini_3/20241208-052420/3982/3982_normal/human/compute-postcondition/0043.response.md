The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the results of the calculations `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`, respectively. However, the values of `rx` and `ry` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific values of `x` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `lights` contains at least one light, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first light in lights, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first light in lights; `x` and `y` are assigned values based on the expressions `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`, which cannot be determined without `rx` and `ry`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `lights` contains at least one light, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first light in lights, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first light in lights; `x` and `y` are assigned values based on `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`.**
