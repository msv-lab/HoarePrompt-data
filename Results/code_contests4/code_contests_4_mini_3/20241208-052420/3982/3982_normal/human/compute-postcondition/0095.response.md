To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we first need to analyze the provided variables and their relationships.

1. The variable `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`.
2. The variable `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`.
3. The variable `ans` is not defined in the initial state; thus, it is treated as an unknown value.
4. The expression `x + y - ans` is evaluated, and we need to consider that if this value is less than `0`, `max(0, ...)` will return `0`.

The expression `sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))` can be simplified as follows:

- The calculation within the parentheses becomes `x + y - ans`.
- Therefore, `sp` is assigned the maximum value between `0` and `x - (x + y - ans)`, which simplifies to `sp = max(0, ans - y)`.

Since `ans`, `x`, and `y` are not explicitly defined in terms of specific values in the initial state, the output state will reflect these relationships without concrete numerical values.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`**.
