The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the calculations involving `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, and `ry`. Since `lx` and `ly` are the coordinates of the next light, and `rx` and `ry` are the corresponding coordinates of the robber, `x` and `y` will be determined by subtracting the robber's coordinates from the light's coordinates. The specific values of `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, and `ry` are not provided, but we know that `lx` and `ly` will yield at least one light remaining for the loop to execute a second time.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000; `x` and `y` are the results of the calculations `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000; `x` and `y` are calculated as `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`, respectively.**
