According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, starting from `i = 0` and going up to `i = n - 1`. The initial value of `i` is 500000, which means it is already past the starting point of the loop. For the loop to execute correctly, `i` needs to be reset to 0, and `n` should be greater than 0. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` should be reset to 0.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
