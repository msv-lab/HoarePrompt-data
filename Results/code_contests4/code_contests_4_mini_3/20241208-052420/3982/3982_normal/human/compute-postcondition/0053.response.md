According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `lights` collection. Since `lights` contains at least one light, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `lx` and `ly` are the coordinates of the light that was processed, and `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` have been updated with the relative positions `x` and `y`, which were calculated using `lx` and `ly`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lights` must still contain at least one additional light beyond the one currently being processed. The loop iterates over each light in `lights`, so if there are `k` lights initially, after processing one light, there must be at least `k-1` lights remaining for the loop to execute again.

Since `lights` initially had at least one light, we can conclude that after processing one light, there must still be at least one remaining light. Therefore, if the current light was `lx` and `ly`, the next light coordinates will be the next light in the `lights` collection.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `lights` contains at least one additional light for the loop to execute a second time, `lx` and `ly` will be the coordinates of the next light in the collection.**
