The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `f`, which is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of robbers. Each tuple `(a_i, b_i)` consists of two non-negative integers, where \(0 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^6\). The function checks if the parameter `dim`, which is not explicitly included in the function signature but is referenced in the output description, is not empty. If `dim` is not empty, it returns a list generated by calling `func_5` with the coordinates of robbers `f` and the elements of the searchlights `dim`, starting from the second element, repeated `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, the function simply returns the list of tuples representing the coordinates of robbers `f`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to accept a list of tuples `f` representing the coordinates of robbers and return a modified list based on the coordinates of searchlights if available, or the list of robbers otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `f` representing the coordinates of robbers and returns a modified list based on the coordinates of searchlights if `dim` is not empty; otherwise, it returns the list of tuples representing the coordinates of robbers `f`.**
