The code appends the value of `x` to the list `rel_lights_x`. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are used directly in the append operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `y`, along with the addition of `x` to `rel_lights_x`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `x` and `y` are calculated as `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`, respectively; `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`.**
