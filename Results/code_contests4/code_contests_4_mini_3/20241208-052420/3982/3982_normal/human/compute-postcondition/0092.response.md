According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is between 1 and 2000, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` is currently 0, it will become 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1 (as it is currently between 1 and 2000).

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.**
