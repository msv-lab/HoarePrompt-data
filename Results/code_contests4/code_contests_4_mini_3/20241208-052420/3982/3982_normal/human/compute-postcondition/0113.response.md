To analyze the output state of the program after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the initial state provided.

The loop iterates over the `avail` list, which has a size of 1000002. The variable `psum` accumulates the sum of the elements in `avail`, while `psum_min` keeps track of the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations.

Given that `n` is between 1 and 2000 and `avail` has at least 1 element, we can summarize the following:

1. After all iterations, `psum` will equal the sum of all elements in the `avail` list.
2. `psum_min` will be the minimum value of `psum` during the entire process, which will be less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `avail`.
3. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum of `psum` during the iterations, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`.**
