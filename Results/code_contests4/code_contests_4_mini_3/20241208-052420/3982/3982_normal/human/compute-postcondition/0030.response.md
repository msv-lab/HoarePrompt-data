According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lights`, which is an iterable collection. If `lights` contains more pairs of `(lx, ly)`, the loop can execute again for the next pair. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `x` is assigned the value of `lx - rx`, and `y` is assigned the value of `ly - ry`. Since `rel_lights_x` has one more non-negative value and `rel_lights_y` has one more value which is `y`, it indicates that the loop has processed one pair of lights.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lights` must contain at least one more pair of coordinates. If the last processed pair was the first pair, then the next pair will be the second pair in the collection. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that the loop will process the next pair of `(lx, ly)`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` with one more non-negative value added, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry` with one more value which is `y`, `x` is assigned the value of the next `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value of the next `ly - ry`; for the loop to execute a second time, `lights` must have at least 2 pairs of coordinates.**
