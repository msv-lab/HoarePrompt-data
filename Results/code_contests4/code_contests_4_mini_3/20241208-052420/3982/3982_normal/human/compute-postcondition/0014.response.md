The code appends the value of `x` to the collection `rel_lights_x`. The previous value of `x` is derived from the calculation `x = lx - rx`, where `lx` is the second element in `lights` and `rx` is an unknown value. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection, `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the value `y`, `lights` is a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements, `lx` is the second element in `lights`, `ly` is the second element in `lights`, `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection, `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the value `y`, `lights` is a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements, `lx` is the second element in `lights`, `ly` is the second element in `lights`, `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`**.
