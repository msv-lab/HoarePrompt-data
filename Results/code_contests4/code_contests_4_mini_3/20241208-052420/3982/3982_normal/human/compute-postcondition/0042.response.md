According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` collection. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in `lights`, which implies that it is not empty. Additionally, since `robbers` is already stated to have at least one remaining robber after processing one, that condition is satisfied.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `lx` and `ly` would represent the respective coordinates of the last light processed. Therefore, for the loop to be executed again, `lights` must contain at least one light, and `lx` should correspond to the first light's x-coordinate and `ly` to the first light's y-coordinate in the `lights` collection.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `lights` contains at least one light, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first light in lights, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first light in lights**.
