According to the code, the loop iterates over the `avail` list, and the variable `ax` takes on each element of this list in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `ax`, and `ax` is the first element of `avail`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ax` must be updated to the next element in the `avail` list. If `avail` has more elements, `ax` will take on the second element of the list. Therefore, we must ensure that `avail` has at least 2 elements for the iteration to occur again.

State: **`psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `ax`, `ax` is the second element of `avail` for the loop to execute a second time `avail` must have at least 2 elements.**
