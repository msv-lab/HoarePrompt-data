According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `robbers` collection. If there is at least one remaining robber, the loop can execute for that robber. At the end of the last iteration, `robbers` has at least one remaining robber, and the loop has processed one of them, meaning there will now be one less robber in the collection. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must still be at least one remaining robber in the `robbers` collection after this iteration. Therefore, if the previous iteration processed one robber, we can say that there will be at least one remaining robber.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber after processing one, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for each `lx` in `lights` where `lx - rx >= 0`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry` for each `ly` in `lights` where `ly - ry >= 0.`, for the loop to execute again there must be at least one remaining robber in `robbers`.**
