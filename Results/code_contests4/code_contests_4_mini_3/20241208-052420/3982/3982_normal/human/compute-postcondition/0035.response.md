According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `lights` collection. If there are more light pairs to process, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx`, and `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry`. Since `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are derived from `lights`, for the loop to execute one more time, `lights` must contain at least one more pair of `(lx, ly)`. 

Assuming the loop has processed the current light pair, we can denote that the next light pair `(lx, ly)` will be the next element. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `x` should be assigned the next value from `rel_lights_x`, and `y` should be assigned the next value from `rel_lights_y`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry` with the value `y` included, for the loop to execute a next time `lights` must contain at least one more pair of `(lx, ly)`, and `x` is assigned the next value from `rel_lights_x`, `y` is assigned the next value from `rel_lights_y`.**
