According to the code, the loop iterates over the `avail` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `avail` must not be empty. Given that `avail` is a list of size 1000002, we need to ensure it has at least one element. The current state indicates nothing about the contents of `avail`, but since its size is 1000002, it can be assumed that it has been initialized and should contain valid elements for the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, the variables `ans`, `psum_min`, and `psum` would remain unchanged unless modified in the loop body, which is currently omitted. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `avail` contains elements, and we can assume the first iteration will set `ax` to the first element in `avail`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with at least 1 element, `ans` is 500000, `i` is `n`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to `INF`, `psum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
