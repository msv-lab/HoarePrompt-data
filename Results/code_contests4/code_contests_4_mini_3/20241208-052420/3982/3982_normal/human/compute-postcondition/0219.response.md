According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If `avail` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `psum` is `ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, and `ax` is the first element in `avail`. Since `ax` takes the value of the first element in `avail`, after the first iteration, `ax` will update to the second element of `avail` for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `avail` must have at least 2 elements and `ax` will need to be the second element in `avail`.

State: **`psum` is `ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 2 elements, `ax` is the second element in `avail`**
