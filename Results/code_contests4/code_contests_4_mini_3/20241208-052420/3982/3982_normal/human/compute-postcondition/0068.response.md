`avail[i]` is assigned the value 0. Given that `i` is 1, `avail[1]` is set to 0. The previous state of `avail[1]` is not mentioned, but since it is initialized to 0, it remains unchanged. Other variables (`n`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 1, and `avail[1]` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 1, and `avail[1]` remains 0.**
