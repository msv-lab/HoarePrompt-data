Postcondition: ***`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is non-negative, `i` is 2, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `sp` is calculated as max(0, x - (x + y - ans)), `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the `avail` array.***
