`ans` is assigned the value of `l + (r - l) // 2`. The value of `l` can be either 0 or 500001, and the value of `r` can be either 500000 or 1000001. 

1. If `l` is 0 and `r` is 500000:
   - `ans = 0 + (500000 - 0) // 2 = 250000`
   
2. If `l` is 0 and `r` is 1000001:
   - `ans = 0 + (1000001 - 0) // 2 = 500000`
   
3. If `l` is 500001 and `r` is 500000:
   - The loop cannot execute again since `r` is not greater than `500001`.
   
4. If `l` is 500001 and `r` is 1000001:
   - `ans = 500001 + (1000001 - 500001) // 2 = 750001`

Therefore, the output state reflects all possible values for `ans` based on the combinations of `l` and `r`, while also noting that if `l` is 500001 and `r` is 500000, the loop cannot execute again.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `l` is either 0 or 500001; `r` is either 500000 or 1000001; `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001; Loop cannot execute again if `l` is 500001 and `r` is 500000.**
