The values of `l` and `r` are assigned the values `0` and `10 ** 6 + 1`, respectively. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state of `n` while reflecting the new values of `l` and `r`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`; `n` is between 1 and 2000; `l` is 0; `r` is 1000001**
