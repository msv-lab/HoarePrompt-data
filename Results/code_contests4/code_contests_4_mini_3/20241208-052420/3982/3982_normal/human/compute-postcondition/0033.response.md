The value of `y` is appended to the list `rel_lights_y`, which already contains non-negative values. The previous values of `rel_lights_y` are not specified, but we know that it now includes one additional value, which is `y`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `robbers`, and `rel_lights_x` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx`, `rel_lights_y` now includes one more value `y`, `x` is assigned the value of `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value of `ly - ry`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx`, `rel_lights_y` now includes one more value `y`, `x` is assigned the value of `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value of `ly - ry`.**
