The code `rel_lights_y.append(y)` adds the current value of `y` to the collection `rel_lights_y`. Since `y` is already included in `rel_lights_y`, the collection will now contain an additional instance of `y`. The other variables, such as `n`, `m`, `robbers`, `rel_lights_x`, and the existing values in `rel_lights_y`, remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` now includes an additional instance of `y`, and `y` is assigned the next value from `rel_lights_y`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` now includes an additional instance of `y`, `y` is assigned the next value from `rel_lights_y`.**
