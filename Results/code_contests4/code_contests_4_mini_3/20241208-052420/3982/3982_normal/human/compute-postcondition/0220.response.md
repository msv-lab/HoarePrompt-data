`psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`, which is the second element in the list `avail`. Since `psum` was initially `ax`, after the operation, `psum` will now be `2 * ax`. The states of the other variables (`psum_min`, `ans`, and `avail`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum` is `2 * ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `ax` is the second element in `avail`.

Output State: **`psum` is `2 * ax`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `ans` is non-negative, `avail` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `ax` is the second element in `avail`.**
