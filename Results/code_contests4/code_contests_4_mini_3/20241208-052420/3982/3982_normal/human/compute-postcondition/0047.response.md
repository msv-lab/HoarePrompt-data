Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a collection with at least one remaining robber, `lights` contains at least one light, `lx` is the x-coordinate of the first light in `lights`, `ly` is the y-coordinate of the first light in `lights`, `x` and `y` are assigned values based on `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`. If `x` and `y` are both non-negative, then `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x`, and `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.***
