The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the calculations involving `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, and `ry`. The values of `lx` and `ly` are the second elements in the `lights` collection, and we assume `rx` and `ry` are defined variables related to the position of the relative lights. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `x` and `y` based on their previous values. The exact numerical values cannot be determined without knowing `rx` and `ry`, but the relationships will hold.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection, `rel_lights_x` contains the value `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the value `y`, `lights` is a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements, `lx` is the second element in `lights`, `ly` is the second element in `lights`, `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`**.
