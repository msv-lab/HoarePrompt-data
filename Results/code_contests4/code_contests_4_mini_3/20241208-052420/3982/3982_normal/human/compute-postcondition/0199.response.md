The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. Here, `ans` is non-negative and `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`. The exact values of `ans` and `x` are not specified, but we know that `ep` will take the minimum of the two.

Thus, the output state reflects that `ep` is determined based on the values of `ans` and `x`. 

Output State: **`ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`**
