Output State: **`l` is 500001, `r` is the final value determined by the last iteration of the loop, `n` is between 1 and 2000, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with values modified during the loop execution, `ans` is the last computed value that determines the mid-point of the search space, `psum` is the final sum of all elements in `avail`, and `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered throughout all iterations.**
