`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is 1. The specific value of `rel_lights_y[1]` is not provided, but since `n` is between 1 and 2000 and `i` is 1, we know that accessing `rel_lights_y[1]` is valid. The value of `x` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `y`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 1; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]**
