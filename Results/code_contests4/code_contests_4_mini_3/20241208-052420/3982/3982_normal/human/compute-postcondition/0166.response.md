According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `avail` list and the iteration over its elements. The loop will iterate through each element of `avail`. At the end of the last iteration, `ax` is the second element of the `avail` list, and `n` is at least 1, which indicates that there is at least one element in the `avail` list to iterate over.

Since `ax` is set to the second element of `avail`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ax` needs to be set to the third element of `avail`, and the loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `avail`.

State: **`psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `2 * ax`, `ax` is the third element of `avail`**
