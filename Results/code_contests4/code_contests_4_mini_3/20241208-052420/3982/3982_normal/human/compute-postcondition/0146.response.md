Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 1; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]; `sp` is calculated as max(0, ans - y); `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x); `avail[sp]` is increased by 1; if `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
