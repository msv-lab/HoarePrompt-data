According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `lights` collection. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `lx` and `ly` are the first elements in `lights`, meaning that the loop has executed once for this first element. For the loop to execute a second time, it must move to the next element in the `lights` collection.

Since `lights` is non-empty and has already been iterated over for the first element, we can infer that there must be at least two elements in `lights` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, after processing the first element, the next values for `lx` and `ly` will be the second element in the `lights` collection.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `robbers` is a non-empty collection, `rel_lights_x` contains the value `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the value `y`, `lights` is a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements, `lx` is the second element in `lights`, `ly` is the second element in `lights`**
