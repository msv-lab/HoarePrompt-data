Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0 except `avail[ep + 1]` which is decremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. `ans` is 500000, `i` is 0, `x` is `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[0]`, `sp` is either `500000 - y` or 0, and `ep` is min(500000, x).***
