To analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state, we need to break down the components:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is between 1 and 2000
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is 1000001
   - `avail[sp]` is increased by 1 (this is a previous state change)
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`
   - `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`
   - `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`
   - `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `avail[ep + 1] -= 1` modifies the `avail` array at the index `ep + 1`, reducing its value by 1. 
   - The values of `ep` is determined by `min(ans, x)`. Since we do not have specific values for `ans` and `x`, we cannot compute `ep` exactly, but we can maintain that it has been assigned a value based on the provided logic.

Since `avail` is modified, but the exact values of `ans`, `x`, and hence `ep` are unknown, we can still describe the change:

- The value of `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1, but we do not know what `ep` is exactly.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in the `avail` array, without exact numeric values:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`, `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x), and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
