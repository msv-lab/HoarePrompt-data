To determine the output state after the execution of the provided code, we analyze the impact of the code snippet.

1. The variable `psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`.
2. The values of `psum_min` and `psum` are `ax` and `2 * ax`, respectively.
3. Since `psum` is `2 * ax`, we are comparing `ax` (the value of `psum_min`) with `2 * ax`.

Now, if `ax` is a positive number, `2 * ax` will always be greater than or equal to `ax`. Hence, `min(ax, 2 * ax)` will always yield `ax` itself.

Given the initial state, the assignment will result in `psum_min` remaining the same as `ax`.

Thus, the output state summarizing the values and the impact of this operation is:
Output State: **`psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `2 * ax`, `ax` is the second element of `avail`**
