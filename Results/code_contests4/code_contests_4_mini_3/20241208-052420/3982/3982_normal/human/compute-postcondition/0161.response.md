`psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`. The previous value of `psum` is 0, so after the execution, `psum` becomes `0 + ax`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is `INF`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `ax`, `ax` is the first element of `avail`.
