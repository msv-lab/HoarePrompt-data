According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `ans`. If `i` is less than or equal to `ans`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `ans`, meaning the loop has executed `ans + 1` times. To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to `ans + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must be greater than `ans`, which is not possible. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is between 1 and 2000, `ans` is non-negative, `avail[0]` is set to 0, `avail[i]` is set to 0, for the loop to execute a second time `ans` must be greater than `ans` (which is not possible)**.
