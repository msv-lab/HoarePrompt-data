Postcondition: ***`psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum cumulative sum encountered during the iterations, `n` is between 1 and 2000, and `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. Otherwise, `l` is assigned the value `ans + 1`.***
