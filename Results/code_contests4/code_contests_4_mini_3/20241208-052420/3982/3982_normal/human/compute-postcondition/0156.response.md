Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is assigned a computed value, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
