The value of `psum_min` is assigned the minimum of its current value (`INF`) and `psum` (which is `ax`, the first element of `avail`). Since `INF` is typically considered larger than any finite number, the new value of `psum_min` will be `ax`, assuming `ax` is a finite value. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`psum_min` is `ax`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001, `psum` is `ax`, `ax` is the first element of `avail`**
