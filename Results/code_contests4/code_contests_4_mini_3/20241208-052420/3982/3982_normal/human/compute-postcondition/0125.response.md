According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = ans`, which means it will execute `ans + 1` times. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `ans` is 250000, the next value of `i` will be 250001; if `ans` is 500000, the next value of `i` will be 500001; and if `ans` is 750001, the next value of `i` will be 750002. 

Since the loop is designed to run for `ans + 1` iterations, for the loop to execute again, `ans` must remain unchanged, and `i` will be incremented accordingly.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `l` is 0; `r` is either 500000 or 1000001; `ans` is either 250000, 500000, or 750001; `avail[0]` is assigned the value 0; `avail[i]` is now 0 where `i` is either 250001, 500001, or 750002; for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be either 250001, 500001, or 750002 depending on the value of ans.**
