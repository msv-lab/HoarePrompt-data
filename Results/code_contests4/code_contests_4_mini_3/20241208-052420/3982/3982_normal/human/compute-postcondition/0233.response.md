The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the input constraints of coordinates for robbers and searchlights. Since the function definition does not specify any parameters, it may rely on some external data or configuration for its operation. The exact output is not explicitly provided in the prompt, so it cannot be determined without additional context. 

However, based on the input constraints provided, the functionality of the function can be inferred.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on the positions of robbers and searchlights defined within the constraints of their coordinates.**
