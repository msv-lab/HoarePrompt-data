`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is 2. The initial state does not provide specific values for `rel_lights_y`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `y`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 2; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 2; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`**.
