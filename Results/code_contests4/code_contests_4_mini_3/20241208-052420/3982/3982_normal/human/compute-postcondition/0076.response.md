Given the initial state, we have:

- `n` is between 1 and 2000
- `l` is 0
- `r` is 1000001
- `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0
- `ans` is 500000
- `i` is 0
- `x` is `rel_lights_x[0]`
- `y` is `rel_lights_y[0]`
- The sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans` (x + y >= 500000).

Now we analyze the code:

```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

1. Calculate `x + y - ans`. Since `x + y >= 500000`, this value will be non-negative. Specifically, if `x + y` is equal to `ans`, then `x + y - ans` equals 0. If `x + y` is greater than `ans`, then `x + y - ans` is a positive number.

2. The expression inside `max` will be `x - (x + y - ans)`, which simplifies to `x - x - y + ans`, or `ans - y`.

3. Since `ans` is 500000, we have `sp = max(0, 500000 - y)`.

- If `y` is less than or equal to 500000, then `sp` will be positive or zero.
- If `y` is greater than 500000, `sp` will be negative, but due to the `max` function, it will return 0.

Therefore, the exact value of `sp` depends on the value of `y`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 initialized to 0, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 0, `x` is `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[0]`, and `sp` is either `500000 - y` (if `y` <= 500000) or 0 (if `y` > 500000)**.
