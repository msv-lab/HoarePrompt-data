To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the variables involved.

1. The initial state provides that `n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`. However, we do not have specific values for `x`, `y`, or `ans`.

2. The expression `sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))` involves calculating the value of `sp` based on `x`, `y`, and `ans`. The impact of the code is to assign a value to `sp` which is determined by the maximum of 0 and the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`.

3. Without specific values for `x`, `y`, and `ans`, we cannot compute a numerical result for `sp`. However, we can describe the output state based on the relationships defined.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationships and the variables involved, noting that `sp` is assigned based on the provided expression.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 2; `x` is rel_lights_x[2]; `y` is rel_lights_y[2]; `sp` is assigned the value of max(0, x - (x + y - ans))**.
