`avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. The value of `sp` is calculated as `max(0, ans - y)` but its specific value is unknown. The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `ep` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 2000; `i` is 1; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]; `sp` is calculated as max(0, ans - y); `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x); `avail[sp]` is increased by 1.
