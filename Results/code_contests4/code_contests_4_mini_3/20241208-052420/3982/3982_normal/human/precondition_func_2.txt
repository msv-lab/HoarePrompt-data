o is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is a pair of integers (a_i, b_i) representing the coordinates of robbers and the second element is a pair of integers (c_j, d_j) representing the coordinates of searchlights. The number of robbers and searchlights is represented by the length of the list, with constraints 1 ≤ len(robbers) ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ len(searchlights) ≤ 2000. Each coordinate a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6.
