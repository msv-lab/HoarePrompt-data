The function accepts no parameters and calculates a value based on the relative positions of robbers and searchlights. It processes their coordinates to determine the maximum possible value that satisfies certain conditions in a binary search manner. The computed result is printed, indicating the bounds of the search space based on the relationship between robbers and searchlights. The function does not return a value explicitly but prints the final computed result.
