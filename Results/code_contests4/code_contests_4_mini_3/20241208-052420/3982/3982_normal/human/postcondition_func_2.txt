The function accepts a list of tuples `o`, which contains pairs of coordinates. It reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and adds each of these integers to the value of `o`, returning a list of these summed integers. However, the function does not utilize the tuples in `o` for any calculation, making the presence of `o` irrelevant to the output. Therefore, the function effectively returns a list of integers derived solely from user input.
