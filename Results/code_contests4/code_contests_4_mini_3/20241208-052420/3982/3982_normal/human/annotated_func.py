#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and calculates a value based on the relative positions of robbers and searchlights. It processes their coordinates to determine the maximum possible value that satisfies certain conditions in a binary search manner. The computed result is printed, indicating the bounds of the search space based on the relationship between robbers and searchlights. The function does not return a value explicitly but prints the final computed result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of robbers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), m is an integer representing the number of searchlights (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), and each robber's coordinates (a_i, b_i) and each searchlight's coordinates (c_j, d_j) are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6 for all valid i and j.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the input, which are space-separated values entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from user input, returning a list of these integers. It does not handle any potential errors related to invalid input or non-integer values, meaning that if the input is not properly formatted, it may raise an exception.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is a pair of integers (a_i, b_i) representing the coordinates of robbers and the second element is a pair of integers (c_j, d_j) representing the coordinates of searchlights. The number of robbers and searchlights is represented by the length of the list, with constraints 1 ≤ len(robbers) ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ len(searchlights) ≤ 2000. Each coordinate a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers resulting from adding each integer from the input to the list of tuples 'o'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `o`, which contains pairs of coordinates. It reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and adds each of these integers to the value of `o`, returning a list of these summed integers. However, the function does not utilize the tuples in `o` for any calculation, making the presence of `o` irrelevant to the output. Therefore, the function effectively returns a list of integers derived solely from user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and each robber's coordinates (a_i, b_i) and each searchlight's coordinates (c_j, d_j) are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6 for all i in range(n) and j in range(m).
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list generated by calling func_2() n times, where n is an integer between 1 and 2000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `m`, both between 1 and 2000, and returns a list that is generated by calling the function `func_2()` exactly `n` times. The value of `m` is not utilized in the function's logic, which is a potential oversight.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of robbers, where each tuple (a_i, b_i) consists of two non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6; dim is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of searchlights, where each tuple (c_j, d_j) consists of two non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6; the number of robbers and searchlights n and m satisfy 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list generated by calling func_5 with the coordinates of robbers f and the elements of the searchlights dim starting from the second element, repeated dim[0] times, if dim is not empty; otherwise, it returns the list of tuples representing the coordinates of robbers f.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `f` representing the coordinates of robbers. If the variable `dim` (which is not defined within the provided code but is assumed to be accessible) is not empty, it generates and returns a list by calling `func_5` with the coordinates of robbers `f` and the elements of `dim` starting from the second element, repeated `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, it simply returns the list of tuples representing the coordinates of robbers `f`. However, since `dim` is not defined in the function, this could lead to an error or unexpected behavior if `dim` is not properly initialized before the function call.
