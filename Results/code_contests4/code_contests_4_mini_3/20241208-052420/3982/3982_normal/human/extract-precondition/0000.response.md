Precondition: **f is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of robbers, where each tuple (a_i, b_i) consists of two non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6; dim is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of searchlights, where each tuple (c_j, d_j) consists of two non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6; the number of robbers and searchlights n and m satisfy 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000.**
