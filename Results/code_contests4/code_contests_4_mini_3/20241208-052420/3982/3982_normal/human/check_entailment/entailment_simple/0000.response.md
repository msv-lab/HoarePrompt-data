Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Misinterpretation of Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the inputs of robbers and searchlights to determine the minimum number of moves required to ensure no robber is visible to any searchlight. However, the implementation does not clearly delineate how to compute the minimum number of moves based on the coordinates of robbers and searchlights.

2. **Logical Flaw in the Handling of Visibility**:
   - The way the program attempts to compare the coordinates of robbers and searchlights is flawed. It collects differences (`lx - rx` and `ly - ry`) and checks for conditions that do not accurately capture the logic needed to determine visibility. According to the problem description, a searchlight can see a robber if the robber's x-coordinate is less than or equal to the searchlight's x-coordinate and similarly for y-coordinates. The current implementation does not correctly create a mechanism to account for all robbers and their visibility constraints collectively.

3. **Incorrect Logic in Move Calculation**:
   - The binary search logic used in the program does not correspond to the calculation of moves as described in the problem. The problem requires the calculation of the minimum moves to ensure that all robbers are out of sight of all searchlights, which cannot be accurately represented by the binary search mechanism present in the code. The program lacks a clear strategy to derive the moves needed from the relative positions of robbers and searchlights.

4. **Function Misuse**:
   - The function `func_3` is incorrectly structured and does not seem to be utilized in a meaningful way in relation to the problem. The intended functionality of each function does not align with the overall objective of determining the minimum moves.

In summary, the program does not accurately compute the necessary moves to ensure robbers are safe from visibility by searchlights due to flawed logic in visibility checks and move calculations. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.
