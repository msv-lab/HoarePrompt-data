To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will compare the implementation against the problem description and examine the annotations for potential edge cases and issues.

### Problem Description Summary:
The problem requires calculating the minimum number of moves to make the configuration of robbers safe from searchlights. A robber is considered safe if no searchlight can see him, meaning both coordinates of the robber must exceed the coordinates of all searchlights after any moves.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function Overview**:
    - The main function (`func_1`) collects input for robbers and searchlights, computes the relative distances of robbers from searchlights, and then determines the minimum moves required using a binary search strategy.
    - The function `func_2` reads the number of robbers and searchlights.
    - The function `func_4` reads the coordinates of robbers or searchlights.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
    - The binary search iteratively calculates possible move counts (`ans`) and checks if the configuration can be made safe within that move count.
    - It builds lists of how many moves are needed for each robber to be out of sight of the searchlights based on their relative positions.

3. **Potential Issues**:
    - The annotations do not clearly define the purpose or correctness of the binary search logic.
    - The variables `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are constructed but not guaranteed to cover all potential edge cases, particularly when multiple robbers or searchlights are at the same coordinates.
    - The binary search logic does not seem to account for scenarios where robbers may require different numbers of moves based on their initial positions relative to searchlights.

### Edge Cases:
In the provided examples:
- If all robbers start at (0, 0) and all searchlights are at (0, 0), the program should determine that at least one move is required to ensure safety, which is correctly handled.
- However, if robbers are at (0, 0) and searchlights are at (1, 1), the program must ensure that it recognizes that moving to (1, 1) is not safe, requiring moves to a greater distance. 

### Conclusion:
The handling of edge cases is not sufficiently demonstrated in the binary search logic. Given that the annotations hint at a potential failure to correctly compute the required moves for all configurations and the lack of clarity in the binary search logic, it raises concerns about the correctness of the implementation.

Thus, the program does not guarantee correctness for every potential case as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
