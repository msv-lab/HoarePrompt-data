To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it meets the problem description requirements.

### Problem Summary:
1. We need to determine the minimum number of moves required to ensure that no robber is seen by any searchlight.
2. A robber can be moved either to the right or upwards, and the movements apply to all robbers simultaneously.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1()` reads the number of robbers and searchlights, and their respective coordinates. It computes the relative positions of the searchlights concerning the robbers and employs a binary search strategy to find the minimum moves needed for a safe configuration.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Single Robber and Single Searchlight**:
   - Input: `1 1`, Robber at `(0, 0)`, Searchlight at `(0, 0)`.
   - The searchlight can see the robber immediately without any moves, so the expected output should be `1` since we need to move the robber at least once.

2. **Multiple Robbers and Searchlights**:
   - Input: `2 2`, Robbers at `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`, Searchlights at `(1, 1)` and `(1, 0)`.
   - We can analyze the movement and expected output, but the program must ensure that it considers the visibility of all robbers to all searchlights correctly.

3. **Robbers Already Safe**:
   - Input: `2 2`, Robbers at `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)`, Searchlights at `(1, 1)` and `(2, 2)`.
   - The expected output would be `0` since all robbers are already in a safe position.

### Issues Found:
A critical issue in the current implementation is the handling of cases where the robbers are initially positioned such that they cannot be moved into a safe configuration without exceeding the searchlight coordinates. The use of binary search in this context may lead to incorrect results if the bounds are not set accurately based on all robbers' positions.

Given the example of a single robber and searchlight where the coordinates are the same, the program does not correctly account for the need to move the robber even if both are at `(0, 0)`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the edge cases correctly, it may produce incorrect results for certain inputs, especially when the robber's initial position is directly observable by the searchlight. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is as follows:
Correctness: **False**.
