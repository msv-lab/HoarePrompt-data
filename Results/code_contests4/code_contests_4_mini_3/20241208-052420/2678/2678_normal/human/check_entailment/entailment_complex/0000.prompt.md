You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns, where each square is painted white or black. HW characters from A_{11} to A_{HW} represent the colors of the squares. A_{ij} is `#` if the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is black, and A_{ij} is `.` if that square is white.

We will repeatedly perform the following operation until all the squares are black:

* Every white square that shares a side with a black square, becomes black.



Find the number of operations that will be performed. The initial grid has at least one black square.

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 1000
* A_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* The given grid has at least one black square.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
A_{11}A_{12}...A_{1W}
:
A_{H1}A_{H2}...A_{HW}


Output

Print the number of operations that will be performed.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: grid is a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the grid containing characters `#` (black square) and `.` (white square), and the grid has H horizontal rows and W vertical columns such that 1 <= H, W <= 1000, and at least one character in the grid is `#`.
def func_1(grid):
    H, W = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    q = []
    dist = [0] * H
    for i in range(H):
        dist[i] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of vertical columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists.
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if grid[i][j] == '#':
                q.append([i, j])
                grid[i][j] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the list of coordinates `[i, j]` for each `i` and `j` where `grid[i][j]` was '#', `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, and all `grid[i][j]` that were initially '#' are now set to 0 for all valid `i` and `j`.
    maxx = 0
    while q:
        qq = []
        
        for i, j in q:
            for r, c in [[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]:
                if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.':
                    grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1
                    maxx = max(maxx, grid[r][c])
                    qq.append([r, c])
        
        q = qq
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `q` is empty, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `grid` has been fully updated at all valid positions that were originally '.', `maxx` is the maximum distance in `grid` after all updates; all distances from the original '#' positions have been computed and stored in the grid.
    return maxx
    #The program returns the maximum distance 'maxx' calculated in the grid after all updates from the original '#' positions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings representing a grid, where each string consists of characters `#` (black square) and `.` (white square). It calculates the maximum distance from any `#` character to the nearest `.` character in the grid, returning this maximum distance as an integer. The function assumes that there is at least one `#` character in the grid and that the grid dimensions are within the specified limits.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
