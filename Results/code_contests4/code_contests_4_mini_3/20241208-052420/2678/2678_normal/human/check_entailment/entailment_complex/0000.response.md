Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement from the problem description. The main issue is that the program calculates the maximum distance from any `#` character to the nearest `.` character instead of counting the number of operations required to turn all white squares (represented by `.`) into black squares (represented by `#`). 

In detail:
1. The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to propagate from the black squares to the white squares. However, instead of counting how many iterations (or operations) are necessary to turn all adjacent white squares to black, it simply calculates the maximum distance from any `#` to the nearest `.` after all possible conversions.
2. The problem specifically asks for the number of iterations (or rounds of operations) performed until there are no more white squares left that can turn black, but the code only returns the maximum distance, which does not correspond to the number of operations.

Because of this fundamental misunderstanding of the task, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description. Thus, it is incorrect.
