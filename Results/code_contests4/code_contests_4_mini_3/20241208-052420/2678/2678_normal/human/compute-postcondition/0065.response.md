Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, `(i, j)` is the first coordinate in `q`. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `[r, c]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `grid`, `maxx`, or `qq`.***
