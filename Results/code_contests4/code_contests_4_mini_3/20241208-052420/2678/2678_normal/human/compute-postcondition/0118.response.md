According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of coordinates generated from the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute for each coordinate (r, c) derived from the computations involving `i` and `j`. 

The conditions for the loop to execute are that `i` and `j` must be defined and must come from a tuple in `q`. Since you mentioned that `q` contains at least one tuple, we can assume that the first tuple in `q` provides the initial values for `i` and `j`.

To further clarify:
- `r` will be assigned the values `i + 1`, `i - 1`, `i`, and `i` respectively for each iteration.
- `c` will be assigned the values `j`, `j`, `j + 1`, and `j - 1` respectively.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `i` and `j` must be the first elements of the first tuple in `q`.

Given that `H` and `W` are non-negative, they do not directly affect the execution of the loop based on the provided loop structure.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` and `j` are the first elements of the first tuple in `q`**
