According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible adjacent cells of the current position `(i, j)` in the grid. For the loop to execute again, the values of `r` and `c` will change based on the current values of `i` and `j` during each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a valid row index and `j` is a valid column index. The loop will check the following pairs: `[i + 1, j]`, `[i - 1, j]`, `[i, j + 1]`, and `[i, j - 1]`. Therefore, in the next iteration, the values of `r` and `c` will be updated, and the loop will execute again for the next pair of indices.

Since the loop iterates over the four directions, after the last iteration, the next pair will be one of the four configurations. If we assume the loop has finished checking the first direction `[i + 1, j]`, the next values will be `[i - 1, j]`, and so forth, until all pairs are checked.

Since no specific values for `i` and `j` are given, and since `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, we can only state the conditions for the next iteration based on the remaining pairs.

State: **`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; `i` is a valid row index; `j` is a valid column index; for the loop to execute again, the next pair (r, c) will be one of the remaining directions, specifically either [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], or [i, j - 1].**
