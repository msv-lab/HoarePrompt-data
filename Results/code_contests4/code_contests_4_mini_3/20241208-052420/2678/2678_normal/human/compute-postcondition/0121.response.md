`maxx` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the value of `grid[r][c]`. Given that `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, we can infer that `grid[r][c]` is at least 1 greater than `grid[i][j]`. Since `maxx` can take on either its current value or this new value from `grid[r][c]`, the overall effect is that `maxx` could increase but will remain the highest of the two values. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` and `j` are the first elements of the first tuple in `q`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < H`, `c` is an integer such that `0 <= c < W`, `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` and `j` are the first elements of the first tuple in `q`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < H`, `c` is an integer such that `0 <= c < W`, `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`.**
