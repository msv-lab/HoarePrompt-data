Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; `i` and `j` are coordinates from the third pair in `q`. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to max(maxx, grid[r][c]), and `qq` contains an additional entry [r, c]. If the condition is not met, no updates occur.***
