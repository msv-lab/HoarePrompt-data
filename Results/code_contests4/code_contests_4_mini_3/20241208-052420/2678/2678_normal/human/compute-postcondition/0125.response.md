The value at `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. Since `r` is `i` and `c` is `j - 1`, the code updates the element in the `grid` at position `[i][j - 1]` with the value of the element at position `[i][j]` incremented by 1. The other variables, `H` and `W`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the `grid`.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`**
