According to the code, the loop iterates over potential adjacent grid positions based on the current indices `i` and `j`. For the loop to execute again, we need to evaluate the next pairs `(r, c)` generated by the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_next`, `j` is `j_next`, and `q` contains at least one more valid pair. The next pairs that will be processed are `(i_next + 1, j_next)`, `(i_next - 1, j_next)`, `(i_next, j_next + 1)`, and `(i_next, j_next - 1)`.

For the loop to execute again, we need one of these pairs to be valid based on the conditions provided:
1. The row index `r` must be within the bounds of `0 <= r < H`.
2. The column index `c` must be within the bounds of `0 <= c < W`.
3. The position `grid[r][c]` must be valid (i.e., `grid[r][c]` equals '.').

Assuming we want to execute the loop for the next valid position, we will consider the first pair, which is `(i_next + 1, j_next)`. If this position is valid, we will update `grid[r][c]`, `maxx`, and include `[r, c]` in `qq`.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration needs to reflect:
- `i` being updated to `i_next + 1`
- `j` remaining as `j_next` (or we can consider updating `j` for the next valid position if needed).

State: **`q` contains at least one more valid pair, `i` is `i_next + 1`, `j` is `j_next` for the loop to execute the next time if `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` with `grid[r][c]` equal to '.'**
