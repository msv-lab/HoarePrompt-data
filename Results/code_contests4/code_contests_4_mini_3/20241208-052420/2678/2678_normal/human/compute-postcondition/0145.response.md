The code `qq.append([r, c])` adds a new list containing the values of `r` and `c` to the list `qq`. The variables `H`, `W`, `i`, `j`, `grid[r][c]`, and `maxx` are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged conditions of these variables, along with the action taken with `qq`.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; `i` is a valid row index; `j` is a valid column index; `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` has the new value [r, c] appended to it.**
