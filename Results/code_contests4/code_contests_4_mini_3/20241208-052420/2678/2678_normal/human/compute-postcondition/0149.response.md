The variable `maxx` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the value of `grid[r][c]`, which has been updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`. Since `grid[i][j]` is known but the exact values of `maxx`, `grid[i][j]`, `grid[r][c]`, `H`, and `W` are not specified, I can only infer the relationship. 

The state of `maxx` will depend on the comparison between its previous value and the new value of `grid[r][c]`. Therefore, the Output State must reflect that `maxx` is updated based on the maximum value computation.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, where `grid[r][c]` is now `grid[i][j] + 1`.**
