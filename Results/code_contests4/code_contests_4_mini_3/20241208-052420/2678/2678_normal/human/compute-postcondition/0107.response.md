According to the code, the loop iterates over the four neighboring coordinates of the pair `(i, j)`. The variables `r` and `c` represent the current coordinates being processed in the loop. The loop will execute again for the next pair of coordinates in the list `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` and `j` are the coordinates from the third pair in `q`, which is the pair `[i, j + 1]`. This means that the loop has already processed the first three pairs: `[i + 1, j]`, `[i - 1, j]`, and `[i, j + 1]`, and is about to process the last pair `[i, j - 1]`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we will process the last pair's coordinates. The next values for `r` and `c` will be the coordinates from the pair `[i, j - 1]`.

State: **`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; for the loop to execute a second time, `r` is `i`, `c` is `j - 1`, and the condition must hold true: `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W`.**
