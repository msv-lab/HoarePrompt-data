According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`, which needs to be less than `W` for the loop to continue. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `W` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. For the loop to execute again, `W` must be greater than 3.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is at least 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `W` must be greater than 3**
