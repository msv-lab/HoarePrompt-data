Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, `(i, j)` is the first coordinate in `q`, `r` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `r` and `r` is less than `H`, `c` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `c` and `c` is less than `W`, `grid[r][c]` is now `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`.**
