According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i` in relation to `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `H` is greater than 0, and `i` is currently 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `H` must be greater than 2.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is the number of vertical columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list where the first element is an empty list followed by zeros, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `H` must be greater than 2**
