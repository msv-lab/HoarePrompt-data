According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the coordinate pairs generated in the loop. The loop iterates over the four possible directions represented by the coordinate pairs `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `q` contains at least one coordinate pair. The coordinate `(r, c)` represents the first pair in the order of the loop.

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider the next coordinate pair in the list. Since the first pair is `(i + 1, j)`, the next pairs will be `(i - 1, j)`, `(i, j + 1)`, and `(i, j - 1)`. 

Assuming the current pair `(r, c)` corresponds to the first iteration, the next pair for the loop to execute would be `(i - 1, j)`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time:
- The current pair `(r, c)` would need to change to the next coordinate pair.
- We also need to ensure that the bounds for `r` and `c` still hold true according to the grid conditions.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, and `(r, c)` is the coordinate `(i - 1, j)` for the loop to execute a second time.**
