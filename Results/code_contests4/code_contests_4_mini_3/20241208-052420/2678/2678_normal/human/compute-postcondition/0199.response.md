Postcondition: ***`q` contains at least one more valid pair, `i` is `i_next`, `j` is `j_next` for the loop to execute the next time. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is a valid position with `grid[r][c]` equal to '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of `maxx` and the new value of `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` includes the element `[r, c]`. Otherwise, the program does not execute any updates.***
