According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `W`. If `j` is less than `W`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `W` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `W` must be greater than 1.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, if `grid[1][1]` is '#', then `q` contains the coordinates [1, 1].**
