The code appends the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The value of `maxx` is not directly affected by this line of code. Other variables involved are also not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` now includes the coordinates `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`; `qq` now includes the coordinates `[r, c]`.**
