Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; `i` is a valid row index; `j` is a valid column index; if `r` and `c` are within the bounds of the grid and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and the pair [r, c] is appended to `qq`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
