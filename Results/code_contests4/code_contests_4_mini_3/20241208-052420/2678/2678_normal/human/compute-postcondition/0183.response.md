The value of `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. Given that `grid[i][j]` is the previous value at that position, `grid[r][c]` will now hold a value that is one greater than whatever value was in `grid[i][j]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value at `grid[r][c]` based on the previous value at `grid[i][j]`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`**
