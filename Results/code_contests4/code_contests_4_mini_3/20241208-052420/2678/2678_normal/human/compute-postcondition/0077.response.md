According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `q`. If `q` contains more coordinate pairs, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `q` has at least one coordinate pair, and `i` and `j` correspond to the first coordinate pair in `q`. 

For the loop to execute once more, we need to consider that `q` must have at least two coordinate pairs, and the next coordinate pair will be the second one in the list. Therefore, if `q` is the list of coordinate pairs, after the current iteration, we will move to the next coordinate pair, which will be at index 1.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least 2 coordinate pairs, `grid` has been updated at the positions where `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` was '.', `maxx` is the maximum value found in `grid` after updates, `qq` contains all relevant coordinate pairs that were updated during the loop execution, for the loop to execute a second time `i` and `j` will be the second coordinate pair in `q`.**
