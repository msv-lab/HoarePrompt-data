According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of coordinates specified by `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]`, which represent the four possible movements from the current coordinate `(i, j)`. For the loop to execute correctly, it is essential that the variables `i` and `j` are initialized, as they are used to determine the coordinates from which the loop will iterate.

The states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:
1. `i` and `j` must be defined with valid values within the bounds of the `grid`.
2. The loop will execute as long as the list of coordinates contains valid entries, which is ensured by the initialization of `i` and `j`.

Since `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, we assume that the grid dimensions are valid, and thus `i` and `j` should be set appropriately within those bounds to allow the loop to process the specified coordinates.

State: **`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` is set to a valid row index, and `j` is set to a valid column index, for the loop to execute, it will process the coordinates derived from `i` and `j`**.
