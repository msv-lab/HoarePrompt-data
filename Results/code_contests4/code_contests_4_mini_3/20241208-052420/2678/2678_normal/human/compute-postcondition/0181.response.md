Postcondition: ***`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range [0, H-1], `j` is in the range [0, W-1], `r` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `r` which is less than `H`, `c` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `c` which is less than `W`, if `grid[r][c]` was '.', then `grid[r][c]` is now `x + 1`, `maxx` is updated to `max(maxx, x + 1)`, and `qq` is updated to include the pair `[r, c]`.***
