Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, and `(r, c)` is the coordinate `(i + 1, j)`. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now contains the coordinate pair `[r, c]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
