According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `W`. If `j` is less than `W`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `W` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, after the last iteration, `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `W` must be at least 3.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is at least 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `W` must be at least 3**
