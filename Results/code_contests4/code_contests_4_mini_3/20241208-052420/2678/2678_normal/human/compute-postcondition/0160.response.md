According to the code, the loop iterates over the coordinates generated from the current position `(i, j)` by moving in four possible directions: down, up, right, and left. The loop will execute again as long as there are valid coordinates `(r, c)` that satisfy the conditions for `H`, `W`, and the contents of `grid`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `grid[r][c]` has been updated. The coordinate `[r, c]` must have been a valid position within the bounds of the grid and `grid[r][c]` must have been `'.'` for it to contribute to `maxx` and be appended to `qq`.

In the next iteration of the loop, we will be checking the four new coordinates relative to the current position `(i, j)`:
1. `(i + 1, j)` - down
2. `(i - 1, j)` - up
3. `(i, j + 1)` - right
4. `(i, j - 1)` - left

For the loop to execute again, at least one of these new coordinates must satisfy:
- The row index `r` must be within the bounds `0 <= r < H`.
- The column index `c` must be within the bounds `0 <= c < W`.
- The value at `grid[r][c]` should be `'.'`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states for the first valid coordinate that can be derived from `(i, j)`. Assuming that the next valid coordinate is still within bounds and has `grid[r][c]` as `'.'`, the values for `r` and `c` will be determined based on which direction is valid.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute again a valid coordinate `(r, c)` must be obtained by moving to one of the adjacent cells, where `grid[r][c]` is `'.'`.**
