Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` and `j` are coordinates from the third pair in `q`, if `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < H` and `c` is an integer such that `0 <= c < W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, then `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, while the pair `[r, c]` is added to `qq`.***
