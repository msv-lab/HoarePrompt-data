The value `qq` is a list that is being appended with the coordinates `[r, c]`. The previous values of `grid[r][c]` and `maxx` are not directly affected by this operation, but `qq` is updated to include the new element. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is an integer value `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is max(maxx, grid[r][c]); `qq` now includes the element `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is an integer value `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is max(maxx, grid[r][c]); `qq` now includes the element `[r, c]`**
