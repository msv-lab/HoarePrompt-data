The value of `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. The current state indicates that `i` is `i_next + 1` and `j` is `j_next`, suggesting that `grid[i][j]` was previously calculated. Since the initial state states that `grid[r][c]` is accessible based on the conditions given (with `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W`), we can assume that `grid[i][j]` holds a valid value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `grid[r][c]` based on the previous value of `grid[i][j]`.

Output State: **`q` contains at least one more valid pair, `i` is `i_next + 1`, `j` is `j_next`, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`.**
