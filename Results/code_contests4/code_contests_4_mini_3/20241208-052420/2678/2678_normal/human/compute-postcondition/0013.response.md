The code appends the list `[i, j]` to the list `q`. The initial values of `i` and `j` are both 0, so the list `[0, 0]` will be added to `q`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `q` now contains the list `[0, 0]`, `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `grid[i][j]` is equal to '#'.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `q` now contains the list `[0, 0]`, `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `grid[i][j]` is equal to '#'**.
