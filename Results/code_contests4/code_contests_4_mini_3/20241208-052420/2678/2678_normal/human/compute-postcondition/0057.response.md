According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as `q` is not empty. Right before the loop, `q` contains the list of coordinates `[i, j]` for each `i` and `j` where `grid[i][j]` was '#'. Since `q` is populated with these coordinates, it is implied that there is at least one coordinate in `q` for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, in this case, no adjustments are needed for the state, as `q` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the list of coordinates `[i, j]` for each `i` and `j` where `grid[i][j]` was '#', `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, and all `grid[i][j]` that were initially '#' are now set to 0 for all valid `i` and `j`; `maxx` is 0**
