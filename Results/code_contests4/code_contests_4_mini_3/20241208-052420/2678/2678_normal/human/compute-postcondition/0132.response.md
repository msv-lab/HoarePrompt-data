`qq` is updated by appending the list `[r, c]` to it. The values of `grid[r][c]` and `maxx` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is updated to be `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now includes the coordinates `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to be `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now includes `[r, c]`.**
