Postcondition: ***`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range [0, H-1], `j` is in the range [0, W-1], and `r` and `c` are integers within their respective bounds. If `r` and `c` are valid indices and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the pair [r, c] is appended to `qq`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `maxx` or `qq`.***
