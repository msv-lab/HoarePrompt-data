According to the code, the loop executes for each coordinate pair generated in the list `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]`. At the end of the last iteration, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `q` contains at least 2 coordinate pairs. The loop is designed to iterate over the four neighboring positions of the coordinate `(i, j)`.

At the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the coordinate pairs that will be processed. The loop will execute for each of the pairs in the list, and since there are four pairs, we will have to adjust the coordinates accordingly.

Since the loop processes the pairs in the order they appear, the current iteration will examine the first coordinate pair `[i + 1, j]`, then proceed to the next pairs `[i - 1, j]`, `[i, j + 1]`, and `[i, j - 1]` in subsequent iterations. 

To execute one more time, we need to update the state to reflect the next coordinate pair processed. After processing the coordinates, we must ensure that the loop can execute for the next pair.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time the next coordinates to be processed are `[i + 1, j]`, `[i - 1, j]`, `[i, j + 1]`, and `[i, j - 1]`**
