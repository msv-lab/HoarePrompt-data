According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `H`. If `H` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `q` is an empty list and `dist` is a list of zeros with length `H`, which does not affect the execution of the loop. For the loop to be executed the first time, `i` needs to start at 0, and `H` must be greater than 0.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is the number of vertical columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list of zeros with length H, `i` is 0**
