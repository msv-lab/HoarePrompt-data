The code `qq.append([r, c])` adds a new list containing the values of `r` and `c` to the existing list `qq`. The initial state specifies that `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, and `maxx` is updated based on the values in `grid`. However, the values of `r`, `c`, and `qq` are not provided in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Since the output state does not change the values of `H`, `W`, or `maxx`, the output only notes the operation performed concerning `qq`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0; `qq` has a new entry [r, c] appended to it.**
