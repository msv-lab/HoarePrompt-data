According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the height `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `H` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `H` must be greater than 1.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is the number of vertical columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list where the first element is an empty list followed by zeros, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `H` must be greater than 1**
