Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least 2 coordinate pairs, `grid` has been updated at the positions where `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in `grid` after updates, `qq` contains all relevant coordinate pairs that were updated during the loop execution, `i` and `j` are the second coordinate pair in `q`, and the indices `r` and `c` are within the bounds of `grid` (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W) and the value at `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
