According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to `H-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop iterates until `i` reaches `H`, for it to execute again, `i` will be incremented to 1. Therefore, the next state must reflect this change, and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 1.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is the number of vertical columns in `grid`, `q` contains the list of coordinates `[0, j]` for each `j` where `grid[0][j]` was '#', `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, `i` is 1, `j` is `W`, and all `grid[0][j]` that were initially '#' are now set to 0.**
