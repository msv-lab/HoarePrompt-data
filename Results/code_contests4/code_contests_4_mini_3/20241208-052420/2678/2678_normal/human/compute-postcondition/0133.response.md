Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0. If `r` is within the range [0, H) and `c` is within the range [0, W) and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to be `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`; and `qq` now includes the coordinates `[r, c]`.***
