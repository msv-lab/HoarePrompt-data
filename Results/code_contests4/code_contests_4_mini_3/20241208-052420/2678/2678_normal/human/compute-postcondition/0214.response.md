Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum value found in `grid`, `qq` contains all valid pairs `[r, c]`, `i` and `j` are defined, and the indices (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), and (i, j - 1) are valid positions in the grid; `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, where `grid[i][j]` is a valid integer.**
