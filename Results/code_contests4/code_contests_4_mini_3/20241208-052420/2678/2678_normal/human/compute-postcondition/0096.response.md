According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of coordinate pairs generated from the current values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if there are valid pairs to iterate over. Each pair should be within the valid bounds of the grid, which is determined by `H` and `W`. 

Given that `i` and `j` are the coordinates from the third pair in `q`, we need to consider the potential pairs generated: `[i + 1, j]`, `[i - 1, j]`, `[i, j + 1]`, and `[i, j - 1]`. 

For the loop to execute:
1. The values of `i` and `j` must be valid indices such that `0 <= i < H` and `0 <= j < W` for at least one of the pairs generated.
2. The values of `r` and `c` must remain within the grid boundaries after the adjustments.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes:
- We need to confirm that at least one of the indices generated by the pairs is valid.
- If `i` and `j` are valid, we can proceed to state that the pairs generated will be used for the loop.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` and `j` are coordinates from the third pair in `q`, for the loop to execute there must be at least one valid pair within the grid bounds, specifically either `i + 1 < H`, `i - 1 >= 0`, `j + 1 < W`, or `j - 1 >= 0`.**
