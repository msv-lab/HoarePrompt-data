The value at `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`. The previous value of `grid[i][j]` is unknown, but since `grid[i][j]` is a valid value (it could be any integer), the new value of `grid[r][c]` will be that unknown value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, `(i, j)` is the first coordinate in `q`, `r` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `r` and `r` is less than `H`, `c` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `c` and `c` is less than `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is now `grid[i][j] + 1`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, `(i, j)` is the first coordinate in `q`, `r` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `r` and `r` is less than `H`, `c` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `c` and `c` is less than `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is now `grid[i][j] + 1`.**
