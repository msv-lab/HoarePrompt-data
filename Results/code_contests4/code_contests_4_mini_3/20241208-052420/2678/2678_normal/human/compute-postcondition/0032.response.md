The statement `q.append([i, j])` adds the coordinates `[i, j]` to the list `q`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the coordinates `[1, 1]` are appended to `q`. The condition indicates that `grid[1][1]` is '#', which suggests that the append operation occurs based on this condition. The previous values of `H`, `W`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `q` now contains the coordinates [1, 1].**
