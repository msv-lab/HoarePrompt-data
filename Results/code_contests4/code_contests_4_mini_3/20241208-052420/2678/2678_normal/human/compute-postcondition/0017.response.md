The code `q.append([i, j])` adds the list `[i, j]` to the end of the list `q`. Previously, `q` contained the list `[0, 0]`, and the values of `i` and `j` are `0` and `1`, respectively. Therefore, after executing the code, `q` will now contain `[[0, 0], [0, 1]]`. The other variables, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `i`, and `j`, remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, `q` contains the list [[0, 0], [0, 1]], `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.**
