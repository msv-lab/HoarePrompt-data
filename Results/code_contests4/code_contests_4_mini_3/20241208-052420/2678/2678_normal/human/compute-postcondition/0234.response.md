Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of strings representing a grid, where each string consists of characters `#` (black square) and `.` (white square). It calculates the maximum distance from any `#` character to the nearest `.` character in the grid, returning this maximum distance as an integer. The function assumes that there is at least one `#` character in the grid and that the grid dimensions are within the specified limits.**
