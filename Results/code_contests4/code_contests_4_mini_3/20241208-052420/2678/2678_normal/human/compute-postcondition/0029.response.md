The value of `grid[i][j]` is assigned the value `0`. Since `i` is `1` and `j` is `0`, this means that `grid[1][0]` is updated from `'#'` to `0`. The other variables `H`, `W`, `i`, `j`, and `q` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `grid[1][0]` is 0; `q` contains the coordinates [1, 0].

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `grid[1][0]` is 0; `q` contains the coordinates [1, 0].**
