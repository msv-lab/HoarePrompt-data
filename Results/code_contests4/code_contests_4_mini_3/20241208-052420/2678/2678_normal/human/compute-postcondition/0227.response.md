Postcondition: ***`maxx` is updated to the maximum value depending on `grid[r][c]`. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is `'.'`, then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` includes the coordinates `[r, c]`.***
