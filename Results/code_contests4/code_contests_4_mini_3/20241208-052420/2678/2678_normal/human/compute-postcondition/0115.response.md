According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is truthy (non-zero in this case), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is assigned the value of `qq`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `qq` must be non-zero. We don't have information about the value of `qq`, but we know that `q` must not be zero. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `qq` should be adjusted to be non-zero.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is assigned the value of `qq` and for the loop to execute again `qq` must be non-zero**
