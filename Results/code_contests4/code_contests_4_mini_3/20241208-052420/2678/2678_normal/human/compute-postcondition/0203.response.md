The value of `qq` is a list that is being appended with the new coordinates `[r, c]`. The previous value of `maxx` is not directly affected by this operation, and the state of `grid` isn't altered. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, which is at least `1` greater than `grid[i][j]`, and `qq` now includes the new coordinates `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, which is at least `1` greater than `grid[i][j]`; `qq` now includes the new coordinates `[r, c]`.**
