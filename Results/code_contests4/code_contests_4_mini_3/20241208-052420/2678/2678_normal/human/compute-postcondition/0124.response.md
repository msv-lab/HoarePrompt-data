According to the code, the loop will execute for each tuple `(r, c)` in the list of neighbors around the point `(i, j)`. The values of `r` and `c` are derived from the indices of the neighboring cells. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `H` and `W` are both greater than or equal to 0, and that certain conditions were checked to potentially update the grid and related variables.

The tuples generated for `(r, c)` are:
1. `[i + 1, j]` (down)
2. `[i - 1, j]` (up)
3. `[i, j + 1]` (right)
4. `[i, j - 1]` (left)

If the loop has executed previously, it indicates at least one of these tuples successfully met the condition specified. After the last iteration, the loop will be ready to check the next tuple.

Since the loop processes each of these tuples sequentially, the next tuple to be evaluated is `[i, j - 1]` if it hasn't been processed yet.

State: **`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time the next tuple to check is `[i, j - 1]`, where `r` is `i` and `c` is `j - 1`**
