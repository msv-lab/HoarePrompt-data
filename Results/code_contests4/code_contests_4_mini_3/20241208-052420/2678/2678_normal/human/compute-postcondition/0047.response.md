The code appends the list `[i, j]` to the list `q`. The current states of the variables indicate that `H` is greater than 0, `W` is at least 2, and `j` is 2. The variable `i` is not specified, but it is being used in the append operation. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `W` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `q` now includes a new element `[i, 2]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `q` now includes a new element `[i, 2]`**.
