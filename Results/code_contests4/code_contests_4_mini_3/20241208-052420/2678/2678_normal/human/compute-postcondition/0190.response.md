The variable `qq` is updated to append the list `[r, c]`. The previous state of `qq` is not stated, but it will now contain one additional element, which is the list `[r, c]`. Other variables `H`, `W`, `i`, `j`, `grid`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is assigned the value of `qq`, `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range [0, H-1], `j` is in the range [0, W-1]; `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`; and `qq` is updated to include the element `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range [0, H-1], `j` is in the range [0, W-1]; `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`; and `qq` is updated to include the element `[r, c]`.**
