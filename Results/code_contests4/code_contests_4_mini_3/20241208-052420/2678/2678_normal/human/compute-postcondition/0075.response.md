Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` includes the coordinate pair `[r, c]`.***
