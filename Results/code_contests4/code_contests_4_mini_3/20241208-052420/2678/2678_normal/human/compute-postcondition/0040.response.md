According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `H` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `H` must be greater than 2.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `H` must be greater than 2**.
