Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` and `j` are coordinates from the third pair in `q`, there is at least one valid pair within the grid bounds, specifically either `i + 1 < H`, `i - 1 >= 0`, `j + 1 < W`, or `j - 1 >= 0`. Additionally, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < H`, `c` is an integer such that `0 <= c < W`, and the value at `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
