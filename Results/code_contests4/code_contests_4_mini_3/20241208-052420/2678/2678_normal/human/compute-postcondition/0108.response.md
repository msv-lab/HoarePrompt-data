The value of `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. Given that `r` is `i` and `c` is `j - 1`, we can infer that the operation accesses the grid at indices based on the given values of `i` and `j`. The values of `H` and `W` being greater than or equal to 0 ensure that `r` and `c` are valid indices within bounds.

After executing the code, the specific values of `grid[r][c]` will depend on the values of `grid[i][j]`. Thus, if `grid[i][j]` is some value `x`, then `grid[r][c]` will be `x + 1`.

The output state reflects that `grid[r][c]` has been updated based on the previous value at `grid[i][j]`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`**
