The value at the position `grid[r][c]` is updated to be equal to the value at `grid[i][j]` plus 1. The variables `i`, `j`, `r`, and `c` are all within their specified ranges, and `grid[r][c]` is currently a valid position since it was stated that `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'. 

Since the previous value of `grid[i][j]` is not specified, we denote it as `x`, making the new value of `grid[r][c]` equal to `x + 1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is assigned the value of `qq`, `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range [0, H-1], `j` is in the range [0, W-1], `r` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `r` which is less than `H`, `c` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `c` which is less than `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is now updated to `grid[i][j] + 1` (which is `x + 1`).

Output State: **`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range [0, H-1], `j` is in the range [0, W-1], `r` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `r` which is less than `H`, `c` is an integer such that 0 is less than or equal to `c` which is less than `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is now updated to `grid[i][j] + 1` (which is `x + 1`).**
