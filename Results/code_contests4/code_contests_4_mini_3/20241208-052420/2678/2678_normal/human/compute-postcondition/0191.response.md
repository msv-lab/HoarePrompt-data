Postcondition: ***`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, `H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` is in the range [0, H-1], `j` is in the range [0, W-1]. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` is updated to include the element `[r, c]`. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
