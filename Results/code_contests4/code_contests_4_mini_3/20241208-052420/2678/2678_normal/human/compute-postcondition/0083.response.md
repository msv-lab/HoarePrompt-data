Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `q` is a list containing at least 2 coordinate pairs. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is a '.', then `grid` is updated at position `[r, c]` to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is either the same or updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.***
