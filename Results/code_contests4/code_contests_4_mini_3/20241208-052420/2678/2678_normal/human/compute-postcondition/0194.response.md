According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of pairs generated from the current values of `i` and `j`. For the loop to execute, there must be valid values for `r` and `c` generated from the pairs in the list. Since it is stated that `q` contains at least one more valid pair, we can infer that `i` and `j` need to be set to the appropriate values from `q` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, before the loop starts, `i` and `j` should be set to the next values in `q`. Since `q` contains at least one valid pair, we can denote these next values as `i_next` and `j_next`. 

State: **`q` contains at least one more valid pair, `i` is `i_next`, `j` is `j_next` for the loop to execute the next time**
