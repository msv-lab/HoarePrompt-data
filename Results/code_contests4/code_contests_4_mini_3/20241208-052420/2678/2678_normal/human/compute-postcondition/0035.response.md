According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `W`. Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `W`. Given that `W` is greater than 1, the next value of `j` will be 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 2.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
