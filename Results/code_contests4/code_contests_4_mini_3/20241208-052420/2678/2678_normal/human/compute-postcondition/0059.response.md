According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the list `q`. For the loop to execute at least once, `q` must contain at least one coordinate pair `[i, j]`. Given that `H` and `W` are both greater than or equal to 0, they do not directly influence the execution of the loop. 

Since `q` is stated to have the coordinates `[i, j]` for each `i` and `j` where `grid[i][j]` was initially '#', we can assume that if there were any '#' in the grid, `q` should contain those coordinates. However, if `q` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `q` must contain at least one coordinate. Furthermore, since the loop iterates over `q`, the first values of `i` and `j` should correspond to the first coordinate in that list.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, and (i, j) is the first coordinate in `q`**
