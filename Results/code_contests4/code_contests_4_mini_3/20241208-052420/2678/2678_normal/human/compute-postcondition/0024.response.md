Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is the number of vertical columns in `grid`, `q` contains the list of coordinates `[0, j]` for each `j` where `grid[0][j]` was '#', `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, `i` is 0, `j` is `W` (equal to the number of iterations of the loop), and all `grid[0][j]` that were initially '#' are now set to 0.**
