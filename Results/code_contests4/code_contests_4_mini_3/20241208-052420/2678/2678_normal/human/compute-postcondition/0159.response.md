Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `grid` has an updated value at `grid[r][c]`. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c] == '.'`, then `maxx` is either the maximum value found in the updated grid or `grid[r][c]`, and the coordinate `[r, c]` has been appended to `qq`. If the conditions are not met, no changes occur.***
