The code appends the list `[i, j]` to `q`. The previous state of `q` contains the list `[[0, 0], [0, 1]]`. After appending, `q` will contain `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [i, j]]`, where `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `q` becomes `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, `q` is [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**.
