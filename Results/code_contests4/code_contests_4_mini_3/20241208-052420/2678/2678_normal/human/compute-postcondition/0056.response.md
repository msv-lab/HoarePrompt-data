The variable `maxx` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as `maxx` is the only variable being modified and it is simply set to `0`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the list of coordinates `[i, j]` for each `i` and `j` where `grid[i][j]` was '#', `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, and all `grid[i][j]` that were initially '#' are now set to 0 for all valid `i` and `j`; `maxx` is 0**
