Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; `i` is a valid row index; `j` is a valid column index. If `r` and `c` are within the bounds of the grid and `grid[r][c]` is a '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, `grid[r][c]` is set to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` now contains the appended value `[r, c]`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `maxx`, `grid[r][c]`, or `qq`.***
