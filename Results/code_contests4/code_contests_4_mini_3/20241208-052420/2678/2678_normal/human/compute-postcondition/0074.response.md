The code appends the coordinate pair `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The values of `H`, `W`, and `maxx` remain unchanged, and `qq` is updated to include the new coordinate pair. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now includes the coordinate pair `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` includes the coordinate pair `[r, c]`.**
