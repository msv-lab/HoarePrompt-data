Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0. If the coordinates `(r, c)` are valid (i.e., `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W`) and the value at `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the coordinates `[r, c]` are added to `qq`.***
