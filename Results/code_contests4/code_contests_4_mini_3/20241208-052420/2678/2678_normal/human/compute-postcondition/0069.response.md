Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list containing at least one coordinate pair, `(r, c)` is the coordinate `(i + 1, j)`, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now contains the coordinate pair `[r, c]`.**
