Postcondition: ***`maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]` (which is at least `1` greater than `grid[i][j]`), and `qq` includes the new coordinates `[r, c]` if `r` is within the bounds of `0` to `H-1` and `c` is within the bounds of `0` to `W-1` with `grid[r][c]` equal to '.'; otherwise, `maxx` and `qq` remain unchanged.***
