Postcondition: ***`maxx` is the maximum value found in `grid`, `qq` contains all valid pairs `[r, c]`, `i` and `j` are defined, and the indices (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), and (i, j - 1) are valid positions in the grid. Additionally, `r` is between 0 and H-1, `c` is between 0 and W-1, and the value at `grid[r][c]` is a period ('.').***
