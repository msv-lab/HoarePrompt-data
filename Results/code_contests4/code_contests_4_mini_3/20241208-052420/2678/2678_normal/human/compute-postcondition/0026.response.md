According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `W`. The loop will iterate over the range from 0 to W-1. Since `W` is the number of vertical columns in `grid`, for the loop to execute at least once, `W` must be greater than 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to 1, and `j` is set to `W`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should start at 0, and `W` must be greater than 0.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
