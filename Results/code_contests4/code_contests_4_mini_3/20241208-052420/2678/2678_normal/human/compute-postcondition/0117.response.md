According to the code, for the loop to execute, the list `q` must contain at least one tuple (i.e., at least one pair of values for `i` and `j`). Currently, `qq` is an empty list, which means `q` is also empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `q` must be modified to include at least one tuple. 

Additionally, the states `H` and `W` do not directly affect the execution of the loop but are noted as being greater than or equal to 0.

To summarize, we need to adjust the state as follows: `q` must contain at least one tuple, and we can set `i` and `j` to the first elements of that tuple.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains at least one tuple, and for the loop to execute the first time, `i` and `j` are the first elements of that tuple.**
