According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `W`. If `W` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `H` is greater than 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. The initial value of `i` is 0, which is not used in the loop directly but is part of the outer state. For the loop to be executed the first time, `W` must be greater than 0, and `j` will be initialized to 0 when the loop begins its first iteration.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list containing `H` empty lists, `i` is 0, `j` is 0 (for the loop to execute the first time)**
