Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; `i` is a valid row index; `j` is a valid column index; if `r` is an integer such that 0 <= r < H and `c` is an integer such that 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` includes the pair [r, c]. If these conditions are not met, no changes are made to `grid`, `maxx`, or `qq`.***
