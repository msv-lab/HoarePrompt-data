The value of `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. The previous value of `grid[i][j]` is unknown, but since `grid[r][c]` is being updated, it indicates that the conditions for `r`, `c`, and `grid[r][c]` are met (i.e., `r` is within the range [0, H), `c` is within the range [0, W), and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'). After execution, the new value of `grid[r][c]` will be one greater than the value of `grid[i][j]`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to be `grid[i][j] + 1`**
