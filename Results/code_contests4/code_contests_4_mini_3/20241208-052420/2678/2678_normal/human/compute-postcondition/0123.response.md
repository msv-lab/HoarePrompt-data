Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is equal to `'.'`, then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and the tuple `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to the variables.***
