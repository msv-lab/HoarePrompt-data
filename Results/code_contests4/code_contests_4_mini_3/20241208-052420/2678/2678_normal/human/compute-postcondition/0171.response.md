Output State: **`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0; `grid` is a modified grid where all valid positions `(r, c)` that were previously `'.'` have been updated to `grid[i][j] + 1` for all valid tuples `(r, c)`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated grid, and `qq` contains all coordinates `[r, c]` that were appended during the loop execution.**
