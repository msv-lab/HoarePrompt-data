The code assigns `maxx` the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. The previous state indicates that `grid[r][c]` has been assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, which means `grid[r][c]` is at least 1 (assuming `grid[i][j]` is non-negative). Given that `maxx` is being compared to `grid[r][c]`, the value of `maxx` can either remain unchanged or be updated to at least `grid[r][c]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]` (which is at least `grid[i][j] + 1`).

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]` (which is at least `grid[i][j] + 1`)**.
