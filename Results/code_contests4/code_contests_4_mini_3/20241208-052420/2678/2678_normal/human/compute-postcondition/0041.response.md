According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `W`. If `W` is at least 1, the loop can execute for the first time. The initial state indicates that `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is currently 2, which implies that the loop has already executed at least once.

For the loop to execute a second time, `W` must be at least 2 since `j` will take values starting from 0 up to `W - 1`. 

So, the required adjustments for the loop to execute again are:
- `W` must be at least 2 to allow for a second iteration.
- `j` would start from 0 for the first iteration and would be 1 for the second execution.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 1**
