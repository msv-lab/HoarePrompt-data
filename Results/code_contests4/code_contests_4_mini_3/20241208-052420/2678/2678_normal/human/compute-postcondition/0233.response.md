The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `grid`. `grid` is a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the grid containing characters `#` (black square) and `.` (white square), and the grid has H horizontal rows and W vertical columns with constraints 1 <= H, W <= 1000, and at least one character in the grid is `#`. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum distance 'maxx' calculated in the grid after all updates from the original '#' positions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of strings representing a grid and return the maximum distance calculated from the positions of the black squares in that grid. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter grid and returns the maximum distance calculated in the grid based on the positions of the '#' characters.**
