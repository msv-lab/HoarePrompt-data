According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the coordinates `(r, c)` generated for each iteration. The loop iterates over four possible pairs based on the current coordinates `(i, j)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` and `j` are coordinates from the third pair in `q`, meaning the next pairs `(r, c)` will be generated from this iteration.

After the last iteration, the next pairs will be:
1. `(i + 1, j)` - which will be the first pair.
2. `(i - 1, j)` - which will be the second pair.
3. `(i, j + 1)` - which will be the third pair.
4. `(i, j - 1)` - which will be the fourth pair.

To execute the loop one more time, the loop will generate the first pair `(i + 1, j)`. For the loop to execute again, the new values of `r` and `c` must satisfy the conditions `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W`.

Therefore, the state after the last iteration needs to reflect the next values of `r` and `c`, as well as the conditions for the loop to execute again.

State: **`H` and `W` are greater than or equal to 0, `i` and `j` are coordinates from the third pair in `q`, for the loop to execute one more time `r` is `i + 1` and `c` is `j`, and `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W`.**
