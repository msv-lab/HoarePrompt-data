Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0. If the coordinates `(r, c)` are valid (i.e., `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c] == '.'`), then `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now includes the coordinates [r, c].***
