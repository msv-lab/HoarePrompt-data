Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires a function that calculates the number of excellent numbers of a specific length `n`, constructed using only two specified digits `a` and `b`. It also requires that the sum of the digits of these numbers must itself be a good number (made up of the digits `a` and `b`).

2. **Analyzing the Program**: 
   - The function `func()` does not take any parameters and does not implement any logic related to generating numbers of length `n` using the digits `a` and `b`.
   - Instead, it contains a string of numbers that are converted into a list of integers, which is irrelevant to the problem description.
   - There is no computation of excellent numbers, nor does it check if the sum of the digits is a good number, as required.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the program does not implement the necessary logic to count excellent numbers based on the given problem description, it cannot produce the correct output for any valid input. 

Thus, the program is incorrect in its current form and does not fulfill the requirements of the problem.
