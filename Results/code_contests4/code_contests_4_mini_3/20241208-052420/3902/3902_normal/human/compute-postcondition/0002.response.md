The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `n`. The parameters `a` and `b` are integers constrained by the relationships 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 9, and `n` is a positive integer constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The function's output is not specified in the given information. Therefore, based on the provided constraints, we can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 9, and a positive integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The output behavior of the function is not specified.**
