Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the requirements of the problem description correctly. The description specifies that the program should count how many "excellent" numbers of a specified length `n` exist, formed by the digits `a` and `b`. However, the program given does not perform any calculations related to counting excellent numbers and instead appears to be parsing a string of integers without utilizing the values in a meaningful way.

Moreover, the program should be able to handle the input format and perform the necessary checks to determine whether numbers formed by the digits `a` and `b` are good and excellent, but it fails to do so.

For example, for the input `1 3 3`, the expected output is `1`, which corresponds to the number `111` as the only excellent number of length 3. However, the program does not even check for this condition or return a result.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
