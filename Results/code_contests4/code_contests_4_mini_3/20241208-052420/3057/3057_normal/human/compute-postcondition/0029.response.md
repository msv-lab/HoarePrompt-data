Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is decremented by 1, and `index` is an even integer. If `index` is greater than `(right + left) / 2`, then `left` and `right` are both updated to `(right + left) / 2 + 1`. If `index` is less than or equal to `(right + left) / 2`, the state remains unchanged.***
