`steps` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is 0**
