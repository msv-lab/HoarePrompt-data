The code assigns a new value to `left` based on the average of `right` and `left`, plus 1. The previous values of `left` and `right` are not specified. However, we know that `index` is an even integer, and the formula ensures that `(right + left) / 2` does not equal `index`. This implies that `right` will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Since we don't have specific values for `left` and `right`, we can describe the outcome in general terms. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; `left` is updated to (right + left) / 2 + 1; `right` is adjusted to ensure (right + left) / 2 is not equal to `index`.**
