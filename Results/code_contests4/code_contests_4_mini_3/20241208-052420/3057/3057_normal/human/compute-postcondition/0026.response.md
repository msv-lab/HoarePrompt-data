The value of `steps` is decremented by 1, reducing its previous value by 1. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `index` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; for the loop to execute again `(right + left) / 2` must not equal `index`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; for the loop to execute again `(right + left) / 2` must not equal `index`.**
