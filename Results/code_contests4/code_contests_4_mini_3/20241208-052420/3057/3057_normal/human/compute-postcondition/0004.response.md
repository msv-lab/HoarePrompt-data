The value of `index` is assigned the value of `int(index)`, which converts the input string `index` to an integer. The variables `n` and `k` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is an integer, and `index` is now an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is an integer, `index` is now an integer**.
