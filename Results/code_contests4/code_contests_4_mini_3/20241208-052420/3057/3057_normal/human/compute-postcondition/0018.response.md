Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; `left` is 1; if `index` is less than (right + left) / 2, then `right` is updated to (int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1) + 1) / 2 - 1; otherwise, `index` is greater than or equal to (right + left) / 2, and if `index` is greater than (right + left) / 2, then `left` is updated to `right` while `right` is updated to (right + left) / 2 + 1.***
