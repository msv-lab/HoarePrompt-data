Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is a non-negative integer; `index` is an integer; if `index` is odd (i.e., `index % 2 == 1), the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, if `index` is even, `left` and `right` have been adjusted such that (right + left) / 2 equals `index`, and `steps` has been printed.***
