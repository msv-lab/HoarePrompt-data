`steps` is assigned the value of `int(steps)`, converting the input string `steps` into an integer. The values of `n`, `k`, and `index` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is an integer, and `index` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is an integer, and `index` is an input string.**
