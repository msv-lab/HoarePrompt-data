The code assigns new values to both `left` and `right`. The expression `(right + left) / 2 + 1` calculates the average of `right` and `left`, then adds 1. Given that `index` is an even integer, the new values of `left` and `right` will be the same, as they are both assigned the same expression.

Since `left` and `right` are both updated simultaneously to the same value, we must note that their previous values are not specified in the initial state. Thus, the output will indicate that `left` and `right` are now equal, but their specific values cannot be determined.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are both updated to `(right + left) / 2 + 1`**
