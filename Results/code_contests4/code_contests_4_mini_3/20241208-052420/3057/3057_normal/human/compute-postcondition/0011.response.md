`steps` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `steps` is not provided, but it will now hold a value that is one less than its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an integer that is even; `left` is 1; `right` is int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an integer that is even; `left` is 1; `right` is int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)**
