The value of `right` is updated to `(right + left) / 2 - 1`. The previous values of `left` and `right` are known: `left` is 1 and `right` is `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`. 

Calculating the new value of `right`:
- Let `right` be `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`.
- The new `right` becomes `(int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1) + 1) / 2 - 1`.

Since the specific value of `steps` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the new `right`. However, we can express the output state in terms of the variables:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; `left` is 1; `right` is updated to (int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1) + 1) / 2 - 1; and `index` is less than (right + left) / 2.**
