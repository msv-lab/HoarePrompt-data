The variable `left` is assigned the value 1. The previous states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `steps`, `index`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is an integer, `index` is now an integer, `left` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is an integer, `index` is now an integer, `left` is 1**
