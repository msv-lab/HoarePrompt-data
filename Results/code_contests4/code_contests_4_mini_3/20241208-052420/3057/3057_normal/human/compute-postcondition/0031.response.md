Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented to a value such that `steps` is non-negative; `index` is an even integer; `left` and `right` have been adjusted such that `(right + left) / 2` equals `index`. After all iterations, the loop has terminated.**
