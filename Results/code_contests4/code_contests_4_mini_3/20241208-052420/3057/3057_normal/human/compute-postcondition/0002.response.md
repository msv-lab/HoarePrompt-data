The values of `steps` and `index` are assigned based on the input received from `raw_input()`. The input is split into two parts, which are then assigned to `steps` and `index`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `steps` and `index`, they will take on the values entered via `raw_input()`. The previous values of `steps` and `index` are not specified, so we only know that they will be updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` and `index` are input strings.**
