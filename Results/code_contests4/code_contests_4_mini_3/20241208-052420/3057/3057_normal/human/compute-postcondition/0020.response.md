The value of `steps` is decremented by 1, reducing its previous value by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; `left` is 1; and `right` needs to be adjusted such that `(right + left) / 2` is not equal to `index`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; `left` is 1; `right` needs to be adjusted such that `(right + left) / 2` is not equal to `index`.**
