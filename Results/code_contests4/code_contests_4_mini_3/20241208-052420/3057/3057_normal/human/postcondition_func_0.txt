The function reads two integers from input: `steps` and `index`. If `index` is odd, it prints `1`. If `index` is even, it adjusts `left` and `right` values in a binary search manner until they converge around `index`, decrementing `steps` during each iteration. After the loop, it prints the final value of `steps`. The function does not return any values, and there are no explicit checks for invalid input conditions or the range of `steps` after potentially being decremented.
