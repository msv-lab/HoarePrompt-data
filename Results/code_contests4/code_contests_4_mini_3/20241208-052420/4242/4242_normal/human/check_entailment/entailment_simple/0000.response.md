Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the operations as described in the problem statement for all potential cases. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. Furthermore, `a` is read as a list of strings, but it should be converted to integers.

2. **Permutations and Operations**: The program uses `itertools.permutations(a)` to generate different permutations of the original numbers. However, the way the program constructs the expressions using `eval()` can lead to incorrect results because it does not consider all possible ways the operations can be applied to the numbers. The current logic evaluates only a limited number of arrangements and does not explore the full tree of possible operations.

3. **Evaluation Logic**: The evaluation of expressions is done using a fixed structure that does not account for all combinations of applying three operations on four numbers. The expressions are hardcoded in a way that can miss valid combinations, especially for multiplication, which can yield different results based on the order of operations due to its non-commutative nature.

4. **Lack of Comprehensive Search**: The program does not systematically explore all possible ways to combine the numbers with the operations. For example, with the sequence `* + *`, the order in which you apply the operations matters significantly, and the program does not evaluate all the possible combinations that result from different groupings of operations.

In summary, the program fails to correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement, especially regarding the handling of operations and the evaluation of all possible outcomes from the provided inputs.
