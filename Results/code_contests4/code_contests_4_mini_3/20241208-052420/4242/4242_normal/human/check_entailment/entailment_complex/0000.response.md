The provided annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is not correct in Python 3. It should use `input()`. Additionally, it does not explicitly handle the input format as integers, leading to potential type issues when trying to perform arithmetic operations.

2. **Variable Naming Confusion**: The variable `a` is being re-assigned to the result of `raw_input().split()`, which is a list of strings, making it confusing. The initial integers should instead be stored in separate variables or converted to integers immediately after reading.

3. **Use of `eval`**: Utilizing `eval` to compute the arithmetic operations on strings can be unsafe and inefficient. It can also lead to unexpected results if the input format is not strictly controlled.

4. **Permutations and Expressions**: The program attempts to generate permutations of the input numbers and evaluate expressions based on those permutations. However, it does not correctly implement the required sequence of operations in all possible ways. The combinations of operations must be carefully structured to ensure that every possible order of operations is considered, especially given the non-associative nature of multiplication and addition.

5. **Incorrect Reference to Length of `c`**: The program assumes that `c` will always contain four elements (from permutations of four integers), but the way it processes `c` in the expression evaluation suggests that it may reference out-of-bounds indices, particularly when trying to access `c[3]`, which does not exist in the evaluation context.

6. **Minimal Result Logic**: The logic used to compute the minimum result does not guarantee that all valid combinations of operations and order of numbers are considered. The logic should systematically explore all possible expressions formed by the chosen operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. As such, it cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
