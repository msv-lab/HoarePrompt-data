According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The `itertools.permutations(a)` will generate permutations of the list `a`, and it requires `a` to have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is 100000000000000000000000000. 

So for the loop to be executed the first time, `a` must be a list with at least 1 string, and `c` will be the first permutation of that list.

State: **`res` is 100000000000000000000000000, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a list with at least 1 string, and `c` is the first permutation of that list**
