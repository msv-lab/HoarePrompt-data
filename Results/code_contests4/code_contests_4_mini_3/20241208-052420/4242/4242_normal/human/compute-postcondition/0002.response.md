The value of `z` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will hold a list of strings obtained from user input, split by whitespace. The previous values of `res` and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is assigned the value 100000000000000000000000000; `a` is a list of strings from input; `z` is a list of strings obtained from user input.

Output State: **`res` is assigned the value 100000000000000000000000000; `a` is a list of strings from input; `z` is a list of strings obtained from user input.**
