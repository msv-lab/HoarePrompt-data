The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The previous value of `res` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `res` and the new variable `a` which is a list resulting from the user's input.

Output State: **`res` is assigned the value 100000000000000000000000000; `a` is a list of strings from input**
