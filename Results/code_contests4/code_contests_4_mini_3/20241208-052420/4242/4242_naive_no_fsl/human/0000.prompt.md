You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, Vladimir got bad mark in algebra again. To avoid such unpleasant events in future he decided to train his arithmetic skills. He wrote four integer numbers a, b, c, d on the blackboard. During each of the next three minutes he took two numbers from the blackboard (not necessarily adjacent) and replaced them with their sum or their product. In the end he got one number. Unfortunately, due to the awful memory he forgot that number, but he remembers four original numbers, sequence of the operations and his surprise because of the very small result. Help Vladimir remember the forgotten number: find the smallest number that can be obtained from the original numbers by the given sequence of operations.

Input

First line contains four integers separated by space: 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000 — the original numbers. Second line contains three signs ('+' or '*' each) separated by space — the sequence of the operations in the order of performing. ('+' stands for addition, '*' — multiplication)

Output

Output one integer number — the minimal result which can be obtained.

Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cin (also you may use %I64d).

Program:
```
res = 100000000000000000000000000
a = raw_input().split()
z = raw_input().split()
for c in itertools.permutations(a):
    res = min(res, eval('((' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[1] + c[2] + ')' + z[2] + c[3]))
    res = min(res, eval('(' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[2] + '(' + c[2] + z[1] + c[3] + ')'))
print(res)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
