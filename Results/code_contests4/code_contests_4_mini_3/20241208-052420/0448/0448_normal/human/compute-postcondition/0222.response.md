The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and two lists `h` and `p`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000, while `h` is a list of `n` distinct integers representing the initial positions of the heads in ascending order, and `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers representing the tracks to read in ascending order. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a list of results based on the relationships between the head positions and the track positions. The specific results depend on the conditions defined within the function, but they will be derived from the parameters provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, a list `h` of `n` distinct integers representing head positions, and a list `p` of `m` distinct integers representing track positions. It returns a list of results based on the relationships between the head positions and track positions.**
