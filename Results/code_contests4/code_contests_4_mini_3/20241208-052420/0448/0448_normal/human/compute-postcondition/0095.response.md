To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, I need to analyze the conditions given in the `while` loop.

The loop continues as long as two conditions are met:
1. `pidx < len(p)`
2. `p[pidx] <= furthestright`

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `hidx` is 0
- `pidx` is 1
- `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`

Now, let's evaluate the loop conditions:

1. The first condition, `pidx < len(p)`, requires that `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`. Currently, `pidx` is 1. To ensure the loop can run again, `len(p)` must be greater than 1.

2. The second condition, `p[pidx] <= furthestright`, indicates that the value at index `pidx` of the list `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. At `pidx` equal to 1, we need `p[1]` to be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time:
- `len(p)` must be greater than 1.
- `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Therefore, I will modify the state accordingly:

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 1, `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` is greater than 1 and `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
