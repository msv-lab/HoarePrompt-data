According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. The loop continues as long as `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, and the value of `p[pidx]` must also satisfy the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

Since `len(p)` is greater than `pidx` after the last iteration, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` remains less than or equal to `furthestright`. This means that the previous value of `p[pidx]` (before it was increased) needs to be such that when `pidx` is incremented, the new `p[pidx]` is still valid under the conditions of the loop.

Thus, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` (the value of `p` at the new `pidx` after increment) is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the value of max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0; `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), and for the loop to execute again `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
