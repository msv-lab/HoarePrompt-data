The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables (`len(h)`, `pidx`, `p[pidx]`, and `furthestright`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 3, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` or the last index for which `p[pidx]` was less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 3, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` or the last index for which `p[pidx]` was less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`.**
