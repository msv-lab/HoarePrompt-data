`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. Given that `hidx` is 2 and `len(h)` is greater than 1, `h` must have at least 3 elements for `h[hidx]` to be valid. Therefore, `curpos` will hold the value of the third element of `h` (considering zero-based indexing). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`**.
