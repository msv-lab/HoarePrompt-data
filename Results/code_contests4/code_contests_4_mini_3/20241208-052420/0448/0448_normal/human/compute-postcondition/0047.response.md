The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so the output state reflects the change in `hidx` without affecting any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`), and `hidx` is increased by 1.
