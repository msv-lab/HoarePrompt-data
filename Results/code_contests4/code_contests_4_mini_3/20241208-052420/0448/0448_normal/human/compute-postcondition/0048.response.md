To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions set by the `while` loop:

1. The loop continues as long as `hidx < len(h)` and `pidx < len(p)`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `hidx` has been increased by 1.
   - `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`.
   - `furthestright` is calculated based on `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.
  
Given this information, we need to ensure that both conditions for the `while` loop are satisfied:

- Since `hidx` has been increased by 1, for the loop to execute again, it must remain less than `len(h)`. This means `len(h)` must be greater than the new value of `hidx`.
- `pidx` must also remain less than `len(p)`. Depending on the current state, we may need to adjust `len(p)` to ensure this condition holds true.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure:
- `len(h)` is greater than `hidx` (which is now `previous hidx + 1`).
- `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`.

State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`), and for the loop to execute again `len(h)` is greater than `hidx` and `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`**
