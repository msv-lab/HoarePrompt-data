The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is 0, so after execution, `hidx` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`pidx`, `furthestright`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
