To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to examine the conditions set forth in the `while` statement: `hidx < len(h) and pidx < len(p)`. 

1. The execution of the loop depends on the values of `hidx`, `len(h)`, `pidx`, and `len(p)`.
2. The variable `hidx` is currently 0, and `pidx` is also 0.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, both `hidx` must be less than `len(h)` and `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.

Given that `h` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `len(h)` will be `n`. Similarly, since `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers, `len(p)` will be `m`.

To ensure that the loop can execute:
- `hidx` must be less than `n` (which it is, since `hidx` is 0).
- `pidx` must be less than `m` (which it is, since `pidx` is 0).

Thus, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, for the loop to execute the first time then both `n` and `m` must be greater than 0**
