`avg` is assigned the value of `(ss + ll) // 2`. The value of `ss` is 0 and `ll` is 21000000000, so the calculation is `(0 + 21000000000) // 2`, which equals `10500000000`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are input integers; `h` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted as integers; `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers inputted as integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers; `h` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted as integers; `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers inputted as integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000**.
