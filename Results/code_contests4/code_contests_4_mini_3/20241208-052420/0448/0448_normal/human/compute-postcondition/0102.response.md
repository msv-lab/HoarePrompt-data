`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The variable `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, so `leftget` will take the value of the element in the list `p` at the index `pidx`. The values of the other variables (`hidx`, `len(h)`, and `p`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]**
