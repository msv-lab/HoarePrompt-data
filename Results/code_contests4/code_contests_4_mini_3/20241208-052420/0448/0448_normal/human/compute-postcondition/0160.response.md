The variable `getbacktime` is assigned the value of `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. The variables `curpos` and `leftget` are defined in the initial state, with `curpos` being `h[0]` and `leftget` being `p[0]`. The value of `getbacktime` will depend on the values of `curpos` and `leftget` where the expression `curpos - leftget` is calculated first. 

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `h[0]` and `p[0]`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `getbacktime`. However, we can still deduce its characteristics based on the formula. 

If `curpos` is greater than `leftget`, then `getbacktime` will be a positive value. If `curpos` is less than or equal to `leftget`, then `getbacktime` will be 0 because the `max` function will select 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, and `getbacktime` is either 0 or a positive value based on the comparison of `curpos` and `leftget`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or a positive value based on the comparison of `curpos` and `leftget`.**
