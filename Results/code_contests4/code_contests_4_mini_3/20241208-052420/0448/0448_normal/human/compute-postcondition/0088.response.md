The variable `getbacktime` is assigned the value `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. Given the initial state, we know that `curpos` is `h[0]` and `leftget` is `p[0]`. However, without specific values for `h[0]` and `p[0]`, we cannot compute an exact numeric value for `getbacktime`. The `max` function ensures that `getbacktime` will be at least `0`.

Since the other variables remain unchanged, the output state will reflect the calculation of `getbacktime` based on the current values of `curpos` and `leftget`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, `works` is False, `leftget` is p[0], `curpos` is h[0], and `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (h[0] - p[0])).**
