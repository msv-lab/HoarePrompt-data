To compute the value of `remtime`, we start with the assignment:

`remtime` is assigned the value of `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

1. **Identifying Variables**:
   - `avg` is a value that is not specified in the initial state but is necessary for the calculation.
   - `leftime` is `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, which depends on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`.

2. **Calculating `leftime`**:
   - Given `curpos` is the value of `h[1]` and `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, we compute `leftime` as follows:
     - If `curpos` is greater than `leftget`, `leftime` will be `curpos - leftget`.
     - If `curpos` is less than or equal to `leftget`, `leftime` will be `0`.

3. **Calculating `remtime`**:
   - Now that we have `leftime`, we can substitute it back into the equation for `remtime`:
     - `remtime` will be `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.
     - Depending on the value of `avg` and the computed `leftime`, `remtime` will either be `0` or a non-negative integer based on the expression.

Since we do not have concrete values for `avg`, `curpos`, and `leftget`, we cannot determine exact numerical values for `remtime`, but we can express the output state based on the calculations.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)**
