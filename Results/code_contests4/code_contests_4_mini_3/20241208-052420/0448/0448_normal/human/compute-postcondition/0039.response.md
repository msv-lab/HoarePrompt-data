The variable `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. The value of `remtime` is already defined as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, but the specific values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, `avg`, and `leftime` are not provided. Thus, we cannot calculate the exact value of `furthestright`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship between these variables without specific numerical results.

Output State: **`remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`)**
