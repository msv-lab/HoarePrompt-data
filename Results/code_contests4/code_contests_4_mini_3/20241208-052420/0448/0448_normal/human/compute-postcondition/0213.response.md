The value of `works` is assigned `False`, indicating that either a condition was met during the loop that caused `works` to be set to `False`, or it was explicitly set to `False` without any conditions met. The values of the other variables (`hidx`, `pidx`, `furthestright`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last value of `furthestright`, `furthestright` is the final computed value based on the last `curpos`, `works` is now False, and `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`.
