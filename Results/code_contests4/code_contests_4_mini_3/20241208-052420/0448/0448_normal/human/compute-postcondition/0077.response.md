The value of `avg` is assigned the result of the integer division of the sum of `ss` and `ll` by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `avg` based on the existing values of `ss` and `ll`.

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2**
