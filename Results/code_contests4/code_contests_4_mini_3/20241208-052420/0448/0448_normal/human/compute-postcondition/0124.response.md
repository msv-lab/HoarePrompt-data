The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`, and `works` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
