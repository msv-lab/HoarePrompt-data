The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. Since `pidx` was previously increased by 1, we can only infer that the new value of `pidx` will be one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`hidx`, `len(h)`, `len(p)`, `furthestright`, and `p[pidx]`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`, and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`, and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
