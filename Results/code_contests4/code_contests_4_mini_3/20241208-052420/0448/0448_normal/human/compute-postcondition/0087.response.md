Postcondition: ***`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, `works` is False, `leftget` is p[0], and `curpos` is h[0]. If the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
