The value of `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`. The previous values indicate that `curpos` is `h[0]` and `leftget` is `p[0]`. Therefore, `leftime` will be calculated as `max(0, h[0] - p[0])`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, `works` is False, `leftget` is p[0], `curpos` is h[0], `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (h[0] - p[0])), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is max(0, h[0] - p[0])**
