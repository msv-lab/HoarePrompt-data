According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. The loop will continue executing as long as `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the current element `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `pidx` is 1, `p` is not empty, and `p[0] <= furthestright`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `pidx` is still less than `len(p)` and that the next element `p[pidx]` (which would be `p[1]` for this iteration) is also less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Since `p` is not empty and we currently have `pidx` equal to 1, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, and we must also ensure that `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the conditions to:
1. `len(p)` must be greater than 1.
2. `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is 1, `p` is not empty, `len(p)` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute again `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
