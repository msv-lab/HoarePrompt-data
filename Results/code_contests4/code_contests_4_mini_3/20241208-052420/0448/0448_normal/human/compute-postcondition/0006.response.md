The variable `works` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `h`, `p`, `ss`, `ll`, `avg`). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are input integers; `h` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted as integers; `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers inputted as integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000; `works` is True.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers; `h` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted as integers; `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers inputted as integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000; `works` is True.**
