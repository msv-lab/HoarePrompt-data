Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last value of `furthestright`, `furthestright` is the final computed value based on the last `curpos`, if `works` is True, then `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`; if `works` is False, then `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`, and `works` remains False.***
