The values of `ss` and `ll` are assigned to 0 and 21000000000, respectively. The initial states of `n`, `m`, `h`, and `p` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `ss` and `ll`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers; `h` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted as integers; `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers inputted as integers; `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000**
