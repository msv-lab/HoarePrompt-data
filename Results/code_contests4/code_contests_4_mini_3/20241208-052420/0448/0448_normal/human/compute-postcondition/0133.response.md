To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop. The loop continues as long as `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `hidx` is 2
- `len(h)` is greater than 1
- `pidx` is increased by 1
- `p[pidx]` must still be less than or equal to `furthestright`

Since `pidx` has been increased by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure:
1. `pidx` is still less than `len(p)`.
2. `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since we only know that `len(h)` is greater than 1, it does not provide information about how `len(p)` compares to `pidx`. Therefore, we cannot assume that the loop can still execute without making adjustments.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- We need to ensure that `pidx` is still less than `len(p)`. Thus, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`.
- We also need to ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given that `pidx` was just increased by 1, for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` and `p[pidx]` should satisfy the condition with respect to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
