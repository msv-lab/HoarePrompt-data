The variable `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, which means it retrieves the element at the index `pidx` from the list `p`. The previous states of `hidx` and `len(h)` are not affected by this assignment, but the loop's continuation condition regarding `len(p)` is mentioned. The impact of this code does not change the values of `hidx` or `len(h)`, and `len(p)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, and `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]` while `len(p)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.**
