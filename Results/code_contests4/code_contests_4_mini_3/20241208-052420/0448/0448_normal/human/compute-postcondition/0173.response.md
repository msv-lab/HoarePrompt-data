To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition, which depends on the variables `hidx`, `len(h)`, `pidx`, and `len(p)`.

1. The loop condition is `hidx < len(h) and pidx < len(p)`. This means that both `hidx` must be less than the length of the list `h`, and `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the state indicates that `hidx` is increased by 1, and `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time:
   - `hidx` must be less than `len(h)`. Since `hidx` was increased by 1, it is crucial that it is still less than `len(h)`. Thus, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`.
   - `pidx` must also be less than `len(p)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`.

Given that `pidx` is currently equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, we need to ensure that there are more elements in `p` than those that meet the condition. 

To summarize the adjustments needed:
- `len(h)` must be greater than `hidx` (after incrementing).
- `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`.

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, for the loop to execute again `len(h)` is greater than `hidx` and `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`**.
