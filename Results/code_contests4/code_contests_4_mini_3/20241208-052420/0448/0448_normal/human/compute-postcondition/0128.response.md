The variable `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`. The values of `curpos` and `leftget` are known, with `curpos` being assigned the value of `h[2]` and `leftget` assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. Since `h` has a length greater than 1, `h[2]` is valid. 

However, the exact values of `h[2]` and `p[pidx]` are not provided, so we cannot compute a specific numerical result for `curpos - leftget`. 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `leftime` is determined based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`:

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned the value of max(0, curpos - leftget)**.
