To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop conditions: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. 

1. **Condition 1: `pidx < len(p)`** - This condition checks if `pidx` is within the bounds of the list `p`. Since `pidx` has been increased by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that `pidx` is still less than the length of `p`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.

2. **Condition 2: `p[pidx] <= furthestright`** - This condition checks if the current value of `p` at index `pidx` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. In the previous state, we know that `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. The value of `p[pidx]` must be adjusted accordingly to satisfy this condition.

Given the analysis, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure that `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, which means the initial value of `pidx` must have been less than `len(p) - 1` prior to the increment.
- Ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`); for the loop to execute again `pidx` must be less than len(p) and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
