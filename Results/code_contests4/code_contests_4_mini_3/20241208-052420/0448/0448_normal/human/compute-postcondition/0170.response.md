The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `pidx` is 2, after execution, `pidx` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 3, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or a positive value, `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0, `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` and for the loop to execute again `len(p) > 2 and p[2] <= furthestright`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 3, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or a positive value, `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0, `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, and for the loop to execute again `len(p) > 2 and p[2] <= furthestright`**.
