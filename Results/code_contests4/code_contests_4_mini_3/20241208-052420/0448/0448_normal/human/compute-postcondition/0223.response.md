Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, a list `h` of `n` distinct integers representing head positions, and a list `p` of `m` distinct integers representing track positions. It calculates the minimum average time required for all head positions to reach their respective track positions and prints this value. If it is impossible for all heads to reach the tracks within a certain time, the function will adjust the average time until a valid solution is found. The function does not return a list of results but rather prints a single integer representing the minimum average time that works for all heads. **
