The variable `avg` is not defined in the initial state, but it is used in the expression for `alsotoright`. The value of `getbacktime` has already been calculated as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. Therefore, `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`, which depends on the value of `avg` and `getbacktime`. Since `avg` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `alsotoright`. 

Thus, the output state should reflect that `alsotoright` is set based on `avg` and `getbacktime`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the value of max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), and `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime)**.
