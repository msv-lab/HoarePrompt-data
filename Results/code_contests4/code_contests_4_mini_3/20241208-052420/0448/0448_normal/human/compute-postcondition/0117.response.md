Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is now greater than its previous value, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright.**
