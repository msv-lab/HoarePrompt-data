The value of `hidx` is assigned the value 0. This directly changes the previous value of `hidx`, which was equal to the length of `h`. The other variables (`pidx`, `p`, `ss`, `ll`, `avg`, and `works`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, and `works` is True.
