The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, but it is stated that it has already been increased by 1 previously. Therefore, the new value of `pidx` is now increased by another 1. The other variables `hidx` and the conditions related to the loop remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is increased by 2 and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than current pidx and `p[current pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
