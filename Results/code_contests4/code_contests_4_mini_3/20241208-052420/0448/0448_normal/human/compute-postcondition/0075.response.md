Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright` after all iterations, and `p` is not empty. If `works` is True, then `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`. If `works` is False, then `ss` is equal to `avg + 1.***
