According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. The loop will continue executing while `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` has been increased by 1, and `pidx` has been increased by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:

1. `pidx` (which is now increased by 2) must be less than `len(p)`.
2. `p[current pidx]` (which refers to `p[pidx]` after the increment) must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to satisfy these conditions. Specifically, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than the current `pidx` (which is now `pidx + 2`), and that `p[pidx]` (the updated value after increment) is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, we can state that for the loop to execute again:

- `len(p)` must be greater than current `pidx + 2`.
- `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is increased by 2, and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than current `pidx + 2` and `p[current pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
