Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or a positive value, `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0, `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
