To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop. The loop will continue as long as both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`.
- `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
- `p` is not empty.
- `hidx` is increased by 1.

1. The condition `hidx < len(h)` implies that for the loop to execute again, `hidx` must be less than the total length of `h`. Since `hidx` has been increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `hidx` remains less than `len(h)`. Therefore, `len(h)` must be greater than `hidx` after incrementing.

2. The condition `pidx < len(p)` means that `pidx` also needs to be less than the length of `p`. Given that `p` is not empty, `len(p)` is at least 1. However, since we do not know how `pidx` relates to `len(p)` after the previous iteration, we must ensure that `pidx` is less than `len(p)` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, to summarize:
- For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `len(h)` is greater than `hidx` and `pidx` is less than `len(p)`.

State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `p` is not empty, and for the loop to execute again, `hidx` must be less than `len(h)` and `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`**
