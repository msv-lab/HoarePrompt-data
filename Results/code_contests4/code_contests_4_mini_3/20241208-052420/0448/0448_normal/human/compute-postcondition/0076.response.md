According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ss` and `ll`. If `ss` is less than `ll`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ss` is less than `ll` because the loop is still running. However, we need to ensure that this condition holds for the next iteration.

Since `ss` is less than `ll`, it indicates that there are no changes needed for `ll` as long as it remains greater than `ss`. So, there is no need to adjust `ll`. However, if `ss` is already at the maximum permissible value, we would need to ensure that it is still less than `ll` for the loop to execute again.

Given that `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `p` is not empty, we cannot determine the actual values of `ss` and `ll` without additional context. However, we can assert that as long as `ss` remains less than `ll`, the loop can continue.

Since we don't have specific values for `ss` and `ll` at the end of the last iteration but know that the loop is capable of executing again, we can state that the current conditions allow for another iteration.

State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `p` is not empty, and for the loop to execute again `ss` must be less than `ll`**.
