The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pidx` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`remtime`, `furthestright`, `p`, and `curpos`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`); `pidx` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`); `pidx` is increased by 1.**
