The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is 1, so after execution, `pidx` becomes 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is 2, `p` is not empty, `len(p)` is greater than 1, and `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is 2, `p` is not empty, `len(p)` is greater than 1, and `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
