`pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is 2, so after execution, `pidx` is 3. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is 3, `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` is greater than 2 and `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`pidx` is 3, `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` is greater than 2 and `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
