The value of `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The variable `pidx` determines which element of the list `p` is accessed, and since `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, it must be a valid index within the bounds of `p`. Therefore, `leftget` will hold a value from the list `p`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`**
