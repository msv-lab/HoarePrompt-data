According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and `furthestright`. The loop will execute as long as `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the current element `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

In the given state, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, and `furthestright` is calculated using `curpos` along with `alsotoright` and `remtime`. 

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be satisfied:
1. `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.
2. `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

We have no specific information about the values of `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright` at the moment. However, we can infer that `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`, and the value of `furthestright` should be sufficiently large to allow `p[pidx]` to be less than or equal to it.

To ensure the loop can execute:
- `pidx` must be initialized to a value that is less than `len(p)`.
- `furthestright` must be greater than or equal to the current value `p[pidx]`.

Thus, we can assume that `pidx` should start at 0 (if not already) and `furthestright` should be at least as large as the first element of `p` (if `p` is not empty).

State: **for the loop to execute the first time, pidx is 0 and furthestright is at least p[0] if p is not empty**
