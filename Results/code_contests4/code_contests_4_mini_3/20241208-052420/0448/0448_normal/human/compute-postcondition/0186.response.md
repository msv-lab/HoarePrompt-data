To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
```

The loop will continue executing as long as both conditions are true:
1. `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.
2. The value at `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that both `hidx` and `pidx` have been incremented by 1. This means that `pidx` is now one greater than its value at the end of the last iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, meaning `len(p)` must be greater than the new value of `pidx`.
- The value of `p` at the new `pidx` must still be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since we do not have explicit values for `len(p)` or `furthestright`, we can't definitively state what those values are. However, we need to modify the conditions based on the increment that has happened.

Therefore, we adjust the state to ensure that:
- `len(p)` must be greater than the new `pidx` (which is `previous pidx + 1`).
- The value at `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than current pidx and `p[current pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
