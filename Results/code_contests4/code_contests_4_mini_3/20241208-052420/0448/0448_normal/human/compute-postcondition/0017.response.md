The expression `alsotoright` is assigned the value `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`. The variable `getbacktime` is already defined as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, which means it will evaluate to either 0 or a positive integer, depending on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`. 

Since `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, they are not directly affected by this code. However, the value of `alsotoright` will depend on the value of `avg` and the previously calculated `getbacktime`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0; `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)); `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime).

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0; `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)); `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime)**.
