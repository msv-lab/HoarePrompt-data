To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code and the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `hidx` is increased by 1 (new value is `hidx + 1`).
   - `pidx` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`.
   - `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
   - `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
   - `getbacktime` is assigned the value `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.
   - `alsotoright` is assigned the value `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.
   - `leftime` is assigned `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
   - `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet `furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` assigns a new value to `furthestright`.
   - The value of `furthestright` becomes `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

3. **Impact of the Code**:
   - `furthestright` is now determined by the updated `curpos` and the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`. 
   - Other variables (`hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`) are not altered by this line of code.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since we have derived `furthestright` from the existing variables, we can summarize the output state. The values of `furthestright`, `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` are now linked through this assignment.

Thus, the final output state should reflect the relationship established by the code execution.

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1; `pidx` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `getbacktime` is assigned the value max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)); `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is calculated as max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned the value curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**.
