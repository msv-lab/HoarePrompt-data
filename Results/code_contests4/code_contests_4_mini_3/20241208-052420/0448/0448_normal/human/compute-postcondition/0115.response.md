The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` was greater than or equal to its previous value, and it is now one unit higher. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is now one greater than its previous value, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, and the loop condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must still hold true.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is now one greater than its previous value, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, and the loop condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must still hold true.**
