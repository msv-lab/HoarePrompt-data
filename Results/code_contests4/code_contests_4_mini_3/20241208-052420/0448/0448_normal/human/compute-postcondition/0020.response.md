To analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state:

1. The variable `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
2. The calculation of `alsotoright` is dependent on `avg` and `getbacktime`, while `remtime` is dependent on `avg` and `leftime`.
3. `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, and `remtime` are all derived from the initial values of `curpos`, `leftget`, and `avg`.

Since `n`, `m`, `curpos`, `leftget`, and `avg` are integers greater than 0, we derive:

- `getbacktime` can be calculated as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.
- `alsotoright` would then be `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.
- `leftime` would be `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
- `remtime` would be `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

Finally, `furthestright` will be computed based on the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.

Considering the calculations, although specific values of `curpos`, `leftget`, and `avg` are not provided, the formula will result in a valid integer based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` where `alsotoright` and `remtime` depend on `avg`, `curpos`, and `leftget`.**
