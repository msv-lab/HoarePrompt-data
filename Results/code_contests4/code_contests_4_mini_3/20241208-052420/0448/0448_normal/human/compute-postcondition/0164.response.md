To determine the output state, we first analyze the code snippet and how it affects the existing variables. 

Given the initial state:
- `hidx` is 0
- `pidx` is 0
- `leftget` is `p[0]`
- `curpos` is `h[0]`
- `getbacktime` is either 0 or a positive value
- `alsotoright` is `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`
- `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0
- `remtime` is `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`

The code:
```
furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```
- `curpos` is given as `h[0]`.
- `alsotoright` has been defined as `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.
- `remtime` has been defined as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

The variable `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the greater of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.

Since the specific values of `avg`, `leftget`, `h[0]`, and others are not provided explicitly, we keep the expressions as they are.

After executing the code, the output state reflects the updated information about the variables involved:

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or a positive value, `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0, `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
