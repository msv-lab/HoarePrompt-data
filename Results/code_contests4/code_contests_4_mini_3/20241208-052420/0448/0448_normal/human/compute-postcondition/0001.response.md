The value of `h` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes an input of space-separated integers, converts them to integers, and stores them in a list. The initial state of `n`, `m`, and `p` remains unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `h` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers; `h` is a list of n distinct integers inputted as integers; `p` is a list of m distinct integers.**
