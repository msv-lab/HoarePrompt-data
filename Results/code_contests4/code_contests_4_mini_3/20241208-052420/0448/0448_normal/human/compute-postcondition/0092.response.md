To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will first analyze the variables involved in the computation of `furthestright`.

Initial State:
- `hidx` is 0
- `pidx` is 0
- `p` is not empty
- `ss` is less than `ll`
- `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2
- `works` is False
- `leftget` is `p[0]`
- `curpos` is `h[0]`
- `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (h[0] - p[0]))
- `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime)
- `leftime` is max(0, h[0] - p[0])
- `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)

Now let's compute the value of `furthestright`:
```
furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```

1. We need the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` to compute `furthestright`.
2. `curpos = h[0]` (which is a specific value, assumed to be known but not stated explicitly).
3. `alsotoright = max(0, avg - getbacktime)`: 
   - `avg` is calculated from `ss` and `ll`.
   - `getbacktime` is calculated from `h[0]` and `p[0]`.
4. `remtime = max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`:
   - `leftime` is calculated from `h[0]` and `p[0]`.

Since the exact values of `h[0]` and `p[0]` are not provided, we denote them as:
- Let `h[0]` = `h0`
- Let `p[0]` = `p0`

Thus:
- `getbacktime = max(0, 2 * (h0 - p0))`
- `leftime = max(0, h0 - p0)`
- `avg = (ss + ll) // 2`

Now we can express:
- `alsotoright = max(0, (ss + ll) // 2 - max(0, 2 * (h0 - p0)))`
- `remtime = max(0, ((ss + ll) // 2 - max(0, h0 - p0)) // 2)`

Using these computations, we can find `furthestright`:
```
furthestright = h0 + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```

Since we do not have concrete numerical values, we can summarize:
- `furthestright` will be based on the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`, added to `curpos`.

Finally, we can state the output without specific numerical values:
Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
