The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, `works` is False, `leftget` is p[0], `curpos` is h[0], and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
