The variable `works` is assigned the value `False`, which changes its state from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, `works` is False, `leftget` is p[0], `curpos` is h[0], and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`.
