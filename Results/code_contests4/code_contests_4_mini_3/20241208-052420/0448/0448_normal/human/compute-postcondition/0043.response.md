The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, but it must still satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`); `pidx` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`); `pidx` is incremented by 1**
