To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop can execute if both conditions are satisfied:
1. `pidx < len(p)`
2. `p[pidx] <= furthestright`

Now let's consider the provided state right before the loop:
- `hidx` has been increased by 1.
- `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, so `h` has more elements than `hidx`.
- `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, indicating that `p` has more elements than `pidx`.
- `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` have been assigned values based on prior calculations.

Next, we need to ensure that both conditions for the loop are satisfied:

1. Since `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, the first condition (`pidx < len(p)`) is already satisfied.

2. For the second condition (`p[pidx] <= furthestright`) to be satisfied, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. We don't have specific values for `p[pidx]` and `furthestright`, but we can infer that we need to adjust either `p[pidx]` or `furthestright` to ensure the condition holds.

Since `furthestright` is calculated using `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, we need to ensure that `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`. If we assume `p[pidx]` is currently less than or equal to `furthestright`, we do not need to modify anything. However, if `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, we need to adjust `furthestright` to ensure the condition holds.

Thus, the adjustment needed is:

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the value of max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0; `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), for the loop to execute the first time then p[pidx] is less than or equal to furthestright**
