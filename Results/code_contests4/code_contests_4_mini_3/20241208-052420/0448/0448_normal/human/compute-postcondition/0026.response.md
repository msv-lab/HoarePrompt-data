`pidx` is incremented by 1, so its new value will be 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is 3, `p` is not empty, `len(p)` is at least 3, and `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is 3, `p` is not empty, `len(p)` is at least 3, and `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
