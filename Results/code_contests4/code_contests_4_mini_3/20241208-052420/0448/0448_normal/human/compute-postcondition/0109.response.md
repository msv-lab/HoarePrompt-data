The variable `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`. The value of `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, and `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`. The specific values of `curpos` and `leftget` are not provided, but since `curpos` is greater than `leftget` (as implied by the context), the result of `curpos - leftget` will be a positive value, thereby ensuring that `leftime` will be assigned a non-negative value.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `leftime` based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget)**
