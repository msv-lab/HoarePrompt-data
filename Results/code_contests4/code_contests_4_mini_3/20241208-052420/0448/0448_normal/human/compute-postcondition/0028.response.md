The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `hidx` is unknown. The other variables (`pidx`, `furthestright`, and `p`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `hidx` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; `p` is not empty; `hidx` is increased by 1.**
