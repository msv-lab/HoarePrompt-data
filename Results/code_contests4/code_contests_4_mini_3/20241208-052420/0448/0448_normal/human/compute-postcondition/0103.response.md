`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, and since `hidx` is 1, `curpos` takes the value of the second element in the list `h`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]**
