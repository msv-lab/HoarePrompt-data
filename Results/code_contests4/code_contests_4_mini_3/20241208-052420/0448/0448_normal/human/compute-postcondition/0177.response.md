The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, and `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
