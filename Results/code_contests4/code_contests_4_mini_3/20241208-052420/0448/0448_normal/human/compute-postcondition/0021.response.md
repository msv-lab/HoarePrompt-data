To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions provided in the `while` statement. The loop can execute as long as both conditions are met: `pidx` must be less than `len(p)` and the value `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `pidx`: This is an index that should be less than the length of the list `p`.
   - `p`: This is a list, and we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` exists and is less than or equal to `furthestright`.
   - `furthestright`: This is calculated using the expression `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, which depends on the values of `avg`, `curpos`, and `leftget`.

2. **Conditions for Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, which means `p` should not be empty or `pidx` should be initialized to a valid index (0 or more).
   - The value `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `pidx` is initially set to a value such that it is less than `len(p)`. If `p` is empty, `len(p)` is 0, so `pidx` would need to be set to 0 or another valid index based on the length of `p`.
   - We also need to ensure that `p[pidx]` exists and is less than or equal to `furthestright`. If `furthestright` is not calculated properly or if `p[pidx]` is too high, adjustments would be necessary.

Given that we don't have specific values for `p`, `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, we can summarize the requirements:

If `p` is not empty and `pidx` is initialized to 0, we need to ensure `p[0] <= furthestright`, which implies that `furthestright` must be set to a value greater than or equal to `p[0]`.

State: **`furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` where `pidx` is 0 and `p` is not empty, and `p[0] <= furthestright`**.
