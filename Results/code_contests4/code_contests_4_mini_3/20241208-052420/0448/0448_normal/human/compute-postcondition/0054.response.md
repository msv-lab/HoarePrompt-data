The variable `getbacktime` is assigned the value of `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. Since `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]` and `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, we can calculate `curpos - leftget`. If `curpos - leftget` is positive, `getbacktime` will be `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, otherwise, it will be 0.

Since we do not have specific values for `curpos`, `leftget`, or their difference relative to `avg`, we cannot determine a specific numeric output for `getbacktime`. However, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `getbacktime` based on the condition evaluated.

Output State: **`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)` depending on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`**
