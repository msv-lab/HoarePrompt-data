The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `pidx` is 0, after execution, `pidx` will be 1. The state of the other variable `furthestright` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is 1, `furthestright` is at least `p[0]` if `p` is not empty.

Output State: **`pidx` is 1, `furthestright` is at least `p[0]` if `p` is not empty**
