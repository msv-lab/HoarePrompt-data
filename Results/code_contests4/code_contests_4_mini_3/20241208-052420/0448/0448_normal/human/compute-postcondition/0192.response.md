According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx`, `pidx`, the length of `h`, and the length of `p`. The loop will continue executing as long as both conditions `hidx < len(h)` and `pidx < len(p)` hold true.

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `hidx` to be less than `len(h)` after this increment. This means that `len(h)` must be greater than the previous value of `hidx`. 

The variable `pidx` remains equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, and for the loop to execute again, `pidx` must still be less than `len(p)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(h)` must be greater than the new value of `hidx` (which is just `hidx + 1`) and `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`.

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `len(h)` is greater than `hidx` and `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`**
