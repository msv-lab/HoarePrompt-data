The values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by space. The values of `h` and `p` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `m` based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers; `h` is a list of n distinct integers, `p` is a list of m distinct integers.**
