According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. The loop will execute as long as `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` holds true.

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is 1 and `len(p)` is greater than 1 (since `len(p) > 0` is given). Therefore, the first condition `pidx < len(p)` is satisfied for the loop to execute again, as `1 < len(p)` is true. 

Now, we need to focus on the second condition: `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. Currently, `p[pidx]` refers to `p[1]`, and we do not have information about the values in the list `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, it is necessary that `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since there is no specific information about the values in `p` or `furthestright`, we will need to ensure that `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to state that `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 1, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or a positive value, `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0, `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` and for the loop to execute again `p[1] <= furthestright`**.
