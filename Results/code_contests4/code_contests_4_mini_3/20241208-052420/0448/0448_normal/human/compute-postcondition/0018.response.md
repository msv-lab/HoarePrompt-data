The value of `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`. The previous variables are not affected apart from `leftime`. Since `curpos` and `leftget` are variables that can hold specific integer values greater than 0, the value of `leftime` will be either `0` or a positive integer depending on the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. The exact value of `leftime` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `curpos` and `leftget`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0; `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)); `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget)**
