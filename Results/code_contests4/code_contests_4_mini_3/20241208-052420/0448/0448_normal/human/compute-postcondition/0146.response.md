The variable `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`. Since the value of `avg` remains unchanged and is not specified, `ss` will be equal to whatever the value of `avg` is incremented by 1. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `works` is False, `furthestright` is the last computed value based on the final `curpos`, `avg` remains unchanged, and `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`.
