The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `pidx` is 1, the new value of `pidx` will be 2. The states of the other variables (`hidx`, `furthestright`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 2, `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 2, `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
