To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions within the loop statement: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions are true:
1. `pidx` is 2.
2. `p` is not empty.
3. `len(p)` is greater than 1.
4. `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must hold true after the current state. 

1. **Condition 1 (`pidx < len(p)`):** 
   - Since `len(p)` is greater than 1 and `pidx` is 2, for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 2 (i.e., `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`).
   
2. **Condition 2 (`p[pidx] <= furthestright`):**
   - Currently, `p[pidx]` is `p[2]`, and it must also be less than or equal to `furthestright` for the loop to proceed.

Given that `p` is not empty and `len(p)` is greater than 1, we need to ensure:
- For the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be at least 3 (so that `pidx` can be 2 and still be less than `len(p)`).

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `pidx` is 2, `p` is not empty, `len(p)` is at least 3, and `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
