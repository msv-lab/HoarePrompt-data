To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions governing the `while` loop:

1. The loop condition is `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright`.
2. For the loop to execute, both parts of the condition must be true:
   - `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`.
   - The element at index `pidx` in list `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Now, let's consider the state right before the loop:
- `hidx` is increased by 1, which means it is now 1 more than its previous value.
- `pidx` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`.
- `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
- `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
- `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, and `remtime` are computed based on the values of `curpos`, `leftget`, and `avg`.
- `furthestright` is assigned the value `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

To ensure the loop can execute the first time:
- `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, which implies that `p` must have at least `pidx + 1` elements.
- Additionally, `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. This means the value of `furthestright` must be greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`.

From this, we can conclude that:
- If `pidx` is currently equal to `len(p)`, it needs to be decreased by at least 1 to ensure that `pidx < len(p)`.
- If `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, `furthestright` needs to be increased to be at least `p[pidx]`.

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1; for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`, and `furthestright` must be greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`**.
