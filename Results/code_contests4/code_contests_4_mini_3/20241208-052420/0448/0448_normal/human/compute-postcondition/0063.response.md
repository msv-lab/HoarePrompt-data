To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop conditions: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

1. The variable `pidx` is currently 2. For the loop to execute again, `pidx` must still be less than `len(p)`. Therefore, `len(p)` must be greater than 2.
  
2. The condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must also hold true for the loop to execute again. We know that `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, but we do not have specific information about `p[2]` (the current value of `p[pidx]`). Thus, we need to ensure that `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given that the conditions still hold at the end of the previous iteration, we can conclude:
- `len(p)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue iterating.
- Additionally, `p[2]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`pidx` is 2, `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` is greater than 2 and `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
