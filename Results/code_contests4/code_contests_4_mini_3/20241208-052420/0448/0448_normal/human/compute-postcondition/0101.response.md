According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx`, `len(h)`, and `pidx`, `len(p)`. The loop will continue as long as both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`.

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `hidx` must be less than `len(h)`, which means that `len(h)` must be greater than 1. 

Additionally, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`. Since `pidx` is not given a specific value at the end of the last iteration, we can only conclude that it is currently less than `len(p)` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `len(h)` must be greater than 1,
- `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.

State: **`hidx` is 1, for the loop to execute again `len(h) is greater than 1 and pidx is less than len(p)`**
