The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, but it needs to be less than `len(p)` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `pidx`, while the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is increased by 1, and `p[pidx]` must still be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
