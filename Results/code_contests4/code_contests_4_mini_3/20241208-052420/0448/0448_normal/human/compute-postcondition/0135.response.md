To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions governing the `while` loop.

The loop continues as long as the following two conditions are satisfied:
1. `pidx < len(p)`
2. `p[pidx] <= furthestright`

From the provided state:
- `hidx` is 2
- `len(h)` is greater than 1
- `pidx` is increased by 1 (meaning it has already been incremented)
- The conditions for the loop remain the same.

Since `pidx` has been increased by 1, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that:
1. `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` (which means `len(p)` must be greater than the new value of `pidx`).
2. `p[pidx]` must still be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given that `pidx` was incremented, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than the new value of `pidx`. 

Thus, we can conclude:
- Adjust `len(p)` to be greater than `pidx`, which is now `pidx` (previous value) + 1.
- Ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`, and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
