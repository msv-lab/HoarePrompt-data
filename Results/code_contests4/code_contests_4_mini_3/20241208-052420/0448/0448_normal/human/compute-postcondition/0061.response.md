According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. The loop can execute again if both conditions are met: `pidx` must be less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is 1 and `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, which suggests that `p` is not empty and `p[1]` should be checked against `furthestright`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure:
1. `pidx` remains less than `len(p)`. This means `len(p)` should be greater than 1.
2. `p[pidx]` (which is `p[1]`) must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, it doesn't guarantee that `p[1]` is also less than or equal to `furthestright`. Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`pidx` is 1, `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 1 and `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
