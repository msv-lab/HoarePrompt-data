According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `hidx`, `pidx`, and the lengths of the lists `h` and `p`. The loop will execute as long as both conditions `hidx < len(h)` and `pidx < len(p)` are true.

Right before the loop, `hidx` is 0 and `pidx` is 0. For the loop to execute at least once, both `len(h)` and `len(p)` must be greater than 0. If either `h` or `p` is empty (i.e., has a length of 0), the corresponding index will not satisfy the loop condition, and the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that both `h` and `p` have at least one element. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `len(h)` must be greater than 0
- `len(p)` must be greater than 0

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `len(h)` is greater than 0 and `len(p)` is greater than 0**
