The variable `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`, which remains unchanged from its previous state. The values of `hidx`, `pidx`, `works`, `furthestright`, and `pidx` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `works` is True, `furthestright` is the last computed value based on the final `curpos`, and `avg` remains unchanged; `ll` is equal to `avg`.

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `works` is True, `furthestright` is the last computed value based on the final `curpos`, and `avg` remains unchanged; `ll` is equal to `avg`.**
