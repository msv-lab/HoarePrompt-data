The value of `hidx` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `hidx` was equal to the length of `h`, which is now being set to `0`. The other variables (`pidx`, `furthestright`, `avg`, and `works`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0; `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`; `furthestright` is the last computed value based on the final `curpos`; `avg` is assigned the value of (ss + ll) // 2; `works` is True.
