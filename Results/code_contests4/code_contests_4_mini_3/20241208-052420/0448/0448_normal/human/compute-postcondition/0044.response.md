To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions provided in the loop statement. The loop will continue executing as long as both conditions are satisfied: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `pidx` has been incremented by 1, meaning `pidx` is now one greater than it was at the end of the last iteration.
- `furthestright` is equal to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that:
1. `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`, which means that the initial value of `pidx` before incrementing must have been less than `len(p) - 1`.
2. The condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must still hold true after incrementing `pidx`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that:
- The initial value of `pidx` before incrementing must be less than `len(p) - 1`, which means `pidx` should be less than `len(p) - 1` after incrementing.
- Additionally, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` (the new `pidx`) is still less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Based on this reasoning, we can modify the state as follows:

State: **`remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is `curpos` + max(`alsotoright`, `remtime`); for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) - 1 and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
