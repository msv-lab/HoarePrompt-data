`pidx` is incremented by 1, so its new value will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is 2, `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, and the conditions for the loop to execute again still hold as `len(p)` must be greater than 1 and `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`pidx` is 2, `furthestright` is at least `p[0]`, and the loop conditions still hold.**
