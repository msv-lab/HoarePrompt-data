The variable `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. 

To determine the output state, we need to consider the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`. 

1. `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
2. `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`, where `getbacktime` is `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.
3. `remtime` is assigned the value of `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, where `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0.

Since `avg` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `alsotoright` and `remtime`. Therefore, we have to leave these as expressions. 

The final assignment for `furthestright` will depend on these values, resulting in:

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the value of max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` or 0; `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is assigned the value of curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**.
