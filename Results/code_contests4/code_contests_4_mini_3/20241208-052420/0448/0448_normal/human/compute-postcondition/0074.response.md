The variable `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`. The previous value of `avg` is not specified in the initial state, so the exact value of `ss` cannot be determined. Other variables (`hidx`, `pidx`, `works`, `p`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright` after all iterations, `works` is False, `p` is not empty, and `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`.
