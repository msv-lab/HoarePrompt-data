To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions present in the `while` statement. The loop will execute as long as both conditions `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright` hold true.

1. **Condition 1: `pidx < len(p)`**
   - The state shows that `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, which means this condition is satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `p[pidx] <= furthestright`**
   - In order for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 
   - The value of `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
   - We need to ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to this computed value.

Given the current state:
- We don't have information on the specific values of `p[pidx]`, `curpos`, `alsotoright`, or `remtime`, but we know that `furthestright` is a function of these values.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we can modify the state as follows:
- Ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. This may require adjusting `furthestright` or ensuring `p[pidx]` is an appropriate value.

Therefore, we can state that for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure:
- `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, which is the definition of `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must hold true**.
