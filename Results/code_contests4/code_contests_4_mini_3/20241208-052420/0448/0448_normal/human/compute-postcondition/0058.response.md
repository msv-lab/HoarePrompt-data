To analyze the provided code snippet, we first need to clarify the initial state of the variables involved:

1. `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
2. `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
3. `leftime` is either `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
4. `remtime` is `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

Now, we will calculate the value of `furthestright` using the formula given:

```
furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```

The values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` will determine the value of `furthestright`. However, we do not have specific numerical values for `curpos`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, or any of the variables from the initial state.

Given this context, we can summarize the output state:

- `curpos` is equal to `h[hidx]`.
- `alsotoright` is a variable whose value is not defined.
- `remtime` is calculated based on the previous values and is `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.
- `furthestright` is derived from `curpos` and the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.

Since we do have the relationships but not specific values, we can conclude the output state without exact values.

Output State: **`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftime` is either max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), and `furthestright` is curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**
