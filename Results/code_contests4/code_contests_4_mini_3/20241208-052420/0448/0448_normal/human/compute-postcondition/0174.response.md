The code assigns the value of `p[pidx]` to `leftget`. The variable `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, which means `pidx` is within the valid range of the list `p`. Therefore, `leftget` is assigned the value of the element in `p` at the index `pidx`. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.**
