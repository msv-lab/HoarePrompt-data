To evaluate the provided code snippet, we start by analyzing the existing variables.

1. We have `avg` which is defined as `(ss + ll) // 2`.
2. The variable `getbacktime` is defined as `max(0, 2 * (h[0] - p[0]))`.
3. The variable `alsotoright` is assigned the value `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.

Given that:
- `avg` is calculated from `ss` and `ll`, so its actual value depends on those variables.
- `getbacktime` will also yield a value based on `h[0]` and `p[0]`.

Now, the computation for `alsotoright` will be fully determined by the values of `avg` and `getbacktime`. Since we do not have specific values for `ss`, `ll`, `h[0]`, and `p[0]`, we can only reference them in terms of their relationships.

- If `avg` is greater than or equal to `getbacktime`, `alsotoright` will be `avg - getbacktime`.
- If `getbacktime` is greater than `avg`, `alsotoright` will be 0.

Since we cannot determine specific values for `avg` and `getbacktime` from the given information, the output state will reflect the relationships rather than exact values.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, `works` is False, `leftget` is p[0], `curpos` is h[0], `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (h[0] - p[0])), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime)**.
