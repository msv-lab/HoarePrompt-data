The variable `works` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`, and `works` is False.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`, and `works` is False.**
