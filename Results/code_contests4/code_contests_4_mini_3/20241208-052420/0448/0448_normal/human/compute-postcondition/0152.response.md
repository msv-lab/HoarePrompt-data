The value of `pidx` is assigned the value `0`. Previously, `pidx` was equal to the length of `p`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables (`hidx`, `furthestright`, `avg`, and `works`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0; `pidx` is 0; `furthestright` is the last computed value based on the final `curpos`; `avg` is assigned the value of (ss + ll) // 2; `works` is True.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0; `pidx` is 0; `furthestright` is the last computed value based on the final `curpos`; `avg` is assigned the value of (ss + ll) // 2; `works` is True.**
