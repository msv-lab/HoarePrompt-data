The variable `pidx` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are input integers; `h` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted as integers; `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers inputted as integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000; `works` is True; `hidx` is 0; `pidx` is 0.
