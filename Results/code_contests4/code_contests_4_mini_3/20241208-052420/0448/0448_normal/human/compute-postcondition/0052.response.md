The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `works` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
