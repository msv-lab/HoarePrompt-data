The variable `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. The previous value of `h[hidx]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, while the value of `curpos` is determined, we cannot specify its exact value. The value of `leftget` remains unchanged, assigned from `p[pidx]`. 

Output State: **`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.**
