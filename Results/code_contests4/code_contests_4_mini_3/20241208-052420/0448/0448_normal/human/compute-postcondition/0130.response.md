To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `hidx` is 2
   - `len(h)` is greater than 1
   - `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`
   - `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`
   - `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `2 * (curpos - leftget)`
   - `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`
   - `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`
   - `remtime` is assigned the value of `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`

2. **Execution of the Code Snippet**:
   - `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`

3. **Calculating the Outcome**:
   - `curpos` is already defined as `h[2]`.
   - `alsotoright` is calculated based on the values of `avg` and `getbacktime`.
   - `remtime` is determined by `avg` and `leftime`.
   - The `max(alsotoright, remtime)` will yield either value based on their computed results.
   - Finally, `furthestright` will be computed as `curpos` plus the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.

Since we do not have exact values for `leftget`, `avg`, or the specific values in `h` and `p`, we cannot define `furthestright` numerically. However, we can express it in terms of the existing variables.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2; `len(h)` is greater than 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`; `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `2 * (curpos - leftget)`; `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned the value of max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned the value of curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**
