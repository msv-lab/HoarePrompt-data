To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the loop:

1. The loop will continue as long as `hidx < len(h)` and `pidx < len(p)`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `hidx` is 2.
   - `len(h)` is greater than 1 (which means `len(h)` could be 2 or greater).
   - `pidx` is equal to `len(p)` or the first index where `p[pidx]` exceeds `furthestright`.
   
Given that `pidx` is equal to `len(p)`, this suggests that the loop cannot execute again because the second condition (`pidx < len(p)`) will not hold true in the next iteration.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to modify the state such that `pidx` is less than `len(p)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is at least `pidx + 1`. Since `pidx` is equal to `len(p)` at the end of the last iteration, we can set `pidx` to be less than `len(p)` by adjusting `len(p)`.

State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than 2**.
