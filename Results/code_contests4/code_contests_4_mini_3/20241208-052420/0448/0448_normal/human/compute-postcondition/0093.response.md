According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. The loop will execute if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. Right before the loop, `pidx` is 0, and `furthestright` is defined as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

For the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that:
1. `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, which means `p` must have at least one element.
2. The condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must hold true.

Since `pidx` is 0, `p[pidx]` is the first element of the list `p`. Therefore, we need:
- `len(p)` to be greater than 0 (which means `p` must not be empty).
- `p[0]` (the first element of `p`) needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, if `p` is empty or if `p[0]` is greater than `furthestright`, the loop will not execute. We need to ensure that `p` has at least one element and that the first element is within the bounds defined by `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time then `p` must have at least one element and `p[0]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
