To determine if the `while` loop can execute again, we need to analyze the conditions given in the loop statement: `while ss < ll:`.

From the provided state:
- `ss` is equal to `avg + 1` when `works` is False.
- `ll` is equal to `avg` when `works` is True.

Since `ss` is `avg + 1` and `ll` is `avg`, the condition `ss < ll` will not hold true because:
- `avg + 1` is always greater than `avg`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state of `ss` or `ll` needs to be adjusted. Specifically, we need `ss` to be less than or equal to `ll`. Since `ss` is currently `avg + 1`, we can adjust `ss` to be equal to `ll`, which requires `avg` to be adjusted accordingly.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we can state that:
- For the loop to execute again, we need `ss` to be equal to `ll`, which means `avg` must be adjusted to be equal to `avg + 1`.

State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `furthestright` is the last computed value based on the final `curpos`, and for the loop to execute again, `ss` must be adjusted to be equal to `ll`, meaning `avg` is decreased to be equal to `ss - 1`.**
