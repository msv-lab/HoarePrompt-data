The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` was 1, so the new value of `hidx` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is equal to `len(p)` or the first index where `p[pidx]` exceeds `furthestright`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]` if `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, otherwise `leftget` is not defined since the loop has exited, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is equal to `len(p)` or the first index where `p[pidx]` exceeds `furthestright`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]` if `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, otherwise `leftget` is not defined since the loop has exited, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**.
