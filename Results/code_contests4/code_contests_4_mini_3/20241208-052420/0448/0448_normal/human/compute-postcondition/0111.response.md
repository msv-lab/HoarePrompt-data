To determine the output state, we analyze the impact of the code snippet provided. 

1. **Variable Definitions**:
   - `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`.
   - `alsotoright` can be either `max(0, avg)` or `max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.
   - `remtime` is `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.
   - `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

2. **Evaluating the Variables**:
   - `curpos` is already defined as `h[1]`.
   - The values of `alsotoright` and `remtime` depend on the values of `avg`, `leftget`, and `leftime`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final value of `furthestright` will be `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, which combines the position `curpos` with the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.

Since we do not have specific values for `avg`, `leftget`, and `leftime`, we cannot compute exact numerical outcomes. However, we can express the relationships clearly.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `len(h)` is greater than 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is either 0 or `2 * (curpos - leftget)`, `alsotoright` is either max(0, avg) or max(0, avg - 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**.
