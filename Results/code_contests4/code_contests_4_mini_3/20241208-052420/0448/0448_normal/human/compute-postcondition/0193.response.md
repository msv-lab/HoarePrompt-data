The variable `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The previous state indicates that `pidx` is a valid index, ensuring that `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, allowing access to the element at that index in the list `p`. The values of `hidx` and `len(h)` are not directly affected by this assignment, and the loop condition remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, and `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, and `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.**
