The value of `pidx` is assigned the value `0`. This operation directly affects the variable `pidx`, setting its value to `0`. The other variables (`hidx`, `p`, `ss`, `ll`, `avg`, and `works`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, and `works` is True.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `p` is not empty, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is (ss + ll) // 2, and `works` is True**.
