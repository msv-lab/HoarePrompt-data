The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, and `works` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
