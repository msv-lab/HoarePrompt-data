Correctness: **False**.

The program simply prints `5`, which does not solve the problem as described. The task is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least `k` equal elements in the array. The provided program does not implement any logic to analyze the array or compute the necessary moves based on the input values. 

For example, with the input:
```
6 5
1 2 2 4 2 3
```
The correct output should be `3`, as three moves are needed to make at least five elements equal. However, the program disregards the input entirely and always outputs `5`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is deemed incorrect.
