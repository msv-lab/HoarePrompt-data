Correctness: **False**

The provided program simply prints the number `5`, which does not calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least `k` equal elements in the given array `a`. 

For instance, consider the first example:

Input:
```
6 5
1 2 2 4 2 3
```

In this case, we need to make at least `5` elements equal. The correct output is `3`, meaning the program should calculate the moves needed to reach that result. However, since the program does not perform any computation and always outputs `5`, it will yield an incorrect answer for the provided input.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
