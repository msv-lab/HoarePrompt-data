The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, along with a list `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- `k` is a positive integer that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies the condition \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1,000,000,000\).

The function's output is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot define the exact return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer), and a (a list of n integers), but the specific return value is not defined.**
