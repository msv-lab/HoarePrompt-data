Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func()` simply prints the number `5`, which does not correspond to the task of calculating the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least `k` equal elements in the array `a`. 

The problem requires a function that processes the input values `n`, `k`, and the array `a`, performs operations on the elements of the array (either incrementing the minimum or decrementing the maximum) to achieve the goal, and then outputs the minimum number of moves needed. Since the program does not perform any of these operations or calculations, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it fails to address the actual problem statement.
