Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array a. However, the function simply prints the integer 5 and does not perform any calculations or operations related to the input parameters n, k, or the array a. 

For instance, in the first example provided in the problem description, with the input `6 5` and the array `1 2 2 4 2 3`, the program should compute the minimum number of operations to make at least 5 elements equal, which would require analyzing the input array, performing operations on its elements, and returning the correct number of moves. Instead, the program fails to utilize the input data or implement any logic to achieve the stated goal.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem and is incorrect.
