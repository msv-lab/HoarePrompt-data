The variable `k` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`. Here, `i` is 3 and `j` is 1. First, we calculate `i ** 2`, which is `3 ** 2 = 9`, and `j ** 2`, which is `1 ** 2 = 1`. The sum of these squares is `9 + 1 = 10`. The square root of 10 is approximately `3.162`, but `k` will hold the exact representation of this value in Python. The values of `a`, `b`, `trips`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` includes the initial trips and all valid trips where `k` is not an integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `k` is approximately 3.162.
