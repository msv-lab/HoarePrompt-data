The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The initial state indicates that `sep` is a space. Therefore, after executing this line, a space will be written to the output file. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, a space is written to `file`.**
