The code calls `func_2` with the arguments `-i * mul2` and `j * mul2`. However, no values are provided for `mul2`, `j`, and `i`. Since `mul1` is defined as `a // k`, and `mul2` is not defined in the initial state, it is not possible to determine the values of the arguments passed to `func_2`. As such, we have no specific changes to the initial state variables that we can report.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `b` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `mul1` is the result of `a // k`; `func_2` is called with arguments `-i * mul2` and `j * mul2` but the specific values of `mul2`, `i`, and `j` are unknown.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `b` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `mul1` is the result of `a // k`; `func_2` is called with arguments `-i * mul2` and `j * mul2` but the specific values of `mul2`, `i`, and `j` are unknown.**
