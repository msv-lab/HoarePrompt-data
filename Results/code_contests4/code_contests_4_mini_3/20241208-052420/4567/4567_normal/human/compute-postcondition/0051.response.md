`k` is assigned the value of `int(k)`. Since `k` is dependent on `i`, we do not have a specific value for `k` before conversion, but it will be converted to an integer. The value of `j` being 1001 does not affect the assignment of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is converted to an integer, `j` is 1001, and the loop does not execute again due to `j`.

Output State: **`k` is converted to an integer, `j` is 1001, and the loop does not execute again due to `j`.**
