Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` contains at least 1 valid triplet, `i` is the first element of the triplet, `j` is the second element of the triplet, and `k` is the third element of the triplet. If `a % k == 0` and `b % k == 0`, then `mul1` is `a // k`, `mul2` is `b // k`, and the condition `i * mul1 = mul2 * j` holds true.***
