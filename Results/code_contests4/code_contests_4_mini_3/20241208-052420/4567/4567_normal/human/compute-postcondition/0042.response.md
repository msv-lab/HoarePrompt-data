The code `trips.append([i, j, k])` adds a new trip represented as a list containing the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` to the `trips` list. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are already defined as 3, 1, and 3 respectively. Thus, the new trip `[3, 1, 3]` will be appended to the existing `trips` list. The initial state of `a`, `b`, and the contents of `trips` are unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` includes the initial trips and all valid trips, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 3; `[3, 1, 3]` has been appended to `trips`.**
