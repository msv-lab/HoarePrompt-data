The variable `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`. The value of `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, and `k` is the third element of the triplet, which is also an integer. Since the exact values of `b` and `k` are not specified, the value of `mul2` will depend on these two variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values and the result of the operation.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` contains at least 1 valid triplet, `i` is the first element of the triplet, `j` is the second element of the triplet, `k` is the third element of the triplet, `mul1` is `a // k`, `mul2` is `b // k`.**
