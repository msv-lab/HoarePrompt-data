Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is a space; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list of elements with at least one element written to `file` in string representation, separated by `sep`; a newline character has been written to `file`. If the `flush` keyword argument has been popped from `kwargs` and it is True, the content of `file` is flushed.***
