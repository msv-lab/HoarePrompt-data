The variable `k` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`. However, since `j` is stated to be 1001, which is outside the permissible range for the loop to execute one more time, we cannot determine the value of `k` without knowing the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `k` is dependent on `i`, and `j` is 1001, which leads to the loop not executing again.

Output State: **`k` is dependent on `i`, `j` is 1001 which prevents the loop from executing again.**
