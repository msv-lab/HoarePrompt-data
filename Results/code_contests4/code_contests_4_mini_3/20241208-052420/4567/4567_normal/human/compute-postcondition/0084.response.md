The function `func_2` is called with two arguments: `j * mul1` and `i * mul1`. Here, `mul1` is the result of `a // k`. The values of `j` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot ascertain their values. However, `mul1` can be calculated as `a // k`.

Since `j` and `i` are multiplied by `mul1`, the output state will reflect that the function is called with those expressions, but we cannot determine the exact output values without knowing `j` and `i`. Therefore, the output state will indicate the relationship without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `b` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `mul1` is the result of `a // k`; `func_2` is called with arguments `j * mul1` and `i * mul1`.**
