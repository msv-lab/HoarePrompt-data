To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables.

1. The code `mul2 = b // k` assigns `mul2` the value of `b` divided by `k`, using integer division. 
2. The previous values of `b` and `k` will affect the value of `mul2`.
3. The variable `mul2` is newly assigned, while the values of `a`, `i`, `j`, `mul1`, and the content of `trips` remain unchanged.

Since `b` and `k` are integers that are both between 1 and 1000, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and indicate that `mul2` is calculated based on the values of `b` and `k`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000), `b` is an integer (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000), `trips` contains at least 2 valid triplets, `i` is the first element of the second triplet, `j` is the second element of the second triplet, `k` is the third element of the second triplet; `mul1` is `a // k`, `mul2` is `b // k`.**
