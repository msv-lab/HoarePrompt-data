The variable `trips` is updated by appending the list `[i, j, k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` all have the value 2. Thus, the appended trip is `[2, 2, 2]`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `trips`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `trips` is updated to include the trip [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2]; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `k` is 2**
