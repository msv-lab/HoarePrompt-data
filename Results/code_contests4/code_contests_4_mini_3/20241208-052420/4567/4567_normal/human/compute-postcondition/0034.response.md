The code appends the list `[i, j, k]` to the `trips` list. The current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 2, 3, and 3 respectively. Therefore, the new trip `[2, 3, 3]` will be added to `trips`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the previous trips are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `trips` is updated to include the trip [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2], and [2, 3, 3]; `i` is 2; `j` is 3; `k` is 3**
