The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The constraints indicate that `a` and `b` are integers with values ranging from 1 to 1000. However, since the function does not take any input parameters, it operates independently of these constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` cannot be described in terms of input parameters or their relationships.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
