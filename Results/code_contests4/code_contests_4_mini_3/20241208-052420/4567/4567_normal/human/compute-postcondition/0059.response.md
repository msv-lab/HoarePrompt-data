`mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`, which means `mul1` is calculated by performing integer division of `a` by `k`. Given that `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `k` is a divisor of `a`, the value of `mul1` will be an integer that represents how many times `k` fits into `a`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` contains at least 1 valid triplet, `i` is the first element of the triplet, `j` is the second element of the triplet, `k` is the third element of the triplet, and `mul1` is `a // k`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` contains at least 1 valid triplet, `i` is the first element of the triplet, `j` is the second element of the triplet, `k` is the third element of the triplet, `mul1` is `a // k`**
