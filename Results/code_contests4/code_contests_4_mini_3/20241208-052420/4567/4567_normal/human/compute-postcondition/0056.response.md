Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `trips` contains all valid triplets `[i, j, k]` where `k` is the integer hypotenuse corresponding to the integer values of `i` and `j` calculated from the Pythagorean theorem for each `i` and `j` from 1 to 1000; `a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`.**
