The variable `k` is assigned the value of the expression `(i ** 2 + j ** 2) ** 0.5`. Here, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3. Therefore, we first calculate `i ** 2` which is `2 ** 2 = 4`, and `j ** 2` which is `3 ** 2 = 9`. Now, we add these two results: `4 + 9 = 13`. Finally, we take the square root of 13, which is approximately `3.605551275463989`. 

Since `k` is now updated to the value of approximately `3.605551275463989`, the output state reflects the updated values of the variables. The values of `a`, `b`, `trips`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `trips` is updated to include the trip [2, 1, 2] and [2, 2, 2]; `i` is 2; `j` is 3; `k` is approximately 3.605551275463989.**
