According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `trips`, which contains at least one valid triplet. The loop will execute again for the next triplet in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, and `k` correspond to the first triplet in `trips`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next triplet must be accessed.

Since `trips` contains at least one valid triplet and `i`, `j`, `k` are set to the first triplet, we need to increment to the next triplet. To determine what the new state will be, we assume that the loop has already processed the first triplet. Thus, we need to adjust `i`, `j`, and `k` to represent the next triplet in the list.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` contains at least 2 valid triplets, `i` is the first element of the second triplet, `j` is the second element of the second triplet, `k` is the third element of the second triplet.**
