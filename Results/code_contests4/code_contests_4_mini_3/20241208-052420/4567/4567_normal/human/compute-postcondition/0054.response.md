Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000. The list `trips` includes all valid trips where `k` is an integer, which corresponds to the integer values calculated from the Pythagorean theorem for each `j` from 1 to 1000, along with the fixed value of `i`, which is 3.**
