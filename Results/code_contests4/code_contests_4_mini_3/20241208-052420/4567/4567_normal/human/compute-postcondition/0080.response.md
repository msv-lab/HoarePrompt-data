The variable `mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`, which is the result of integer division of `a` by `k`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are not specified but are within the range of 1 to 1000 and divisible by `k`, thus `mul1` will be an integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `b` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `k` is a divisor; `mul1` is the result of `a // k`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `b` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `k` is a divisor; `mul1` is the result of `a // k.**
