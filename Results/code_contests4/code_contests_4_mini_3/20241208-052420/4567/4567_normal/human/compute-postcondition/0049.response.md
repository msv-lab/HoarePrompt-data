According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `j`, which is iterated from 1 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to 1000 for the loop to have completed its last execution. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1001, which exceeds the range defined by `range(1, 1001)`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be 1001, but it cannot execute again as 1001 is outside the range.**
