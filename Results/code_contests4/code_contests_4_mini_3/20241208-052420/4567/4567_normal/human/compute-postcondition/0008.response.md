The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `file` writes the string representation of `x` to the output.
