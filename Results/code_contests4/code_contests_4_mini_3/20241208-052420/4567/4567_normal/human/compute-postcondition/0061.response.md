Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` contains at least 1 valid triplet, `i` is the first element of the triplet, `j` is the second element of the triplet, `k` is the third element of the triplet, `mul1` is `a // k`, `mul2` is `b // k`, and the condition (i * mul1) is not equal to (mul2 * j).***
