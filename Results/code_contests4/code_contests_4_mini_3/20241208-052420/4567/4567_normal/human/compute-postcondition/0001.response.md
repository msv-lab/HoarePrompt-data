The values of the variables `a` and `b` do not change as the code only modifies `sep` and `file` from the `kwargs` dictionary. The values of `sep` and `file` are assigned as ' ' (a space) and `sys.stdout`, respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is a space; `file` is `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is a space; `file` is `sys.stdout`**.
