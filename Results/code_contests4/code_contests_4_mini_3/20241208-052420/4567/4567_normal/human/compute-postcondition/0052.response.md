`trips` is a list that will have a new sublist appended to it, containing the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `j` is 1001, and `k` is already an integer, the new sublist will be `[i, 1001, k]`. The value of `i` is not provided, so it remains as is. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is converted to an integer, `j` is 1001, and a new sublist `[i, 1001, k]` has been appended to `trips`.

Output State: **`k` is converted to an integer, `j` is 1001, and a new sublist `[i, 1001, k]` has been appended to `trips`.**
