The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output described, it has three possible cases for its return values:

Case 1: The function returns `None`, as there is no value specified to be returned in this case.

Case 2: The function calls another function `func_2` and returns the result of that function call with modified parameters `(-i * mul2, j * mul2)`.

Case 3: The function again returns `None`, as there is no value specified to be returned in this case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to potentially return `None` in some cases or to return a value from another function `func_2` with specific modified parameters in another case.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and may return None or the result of another function based on specific conditions.**
