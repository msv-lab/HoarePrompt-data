Functionality: ** The function calculates all valid Pythagorean triplets (i, j, k) where k is the integer hypotenuse derived from the Pythagorean theorem for integers i and j ranging from 1 to 1000. It then checks if the given integers a and b (both in the range 1 to 1000) are divisible by k. If they are, and if the resulting multiplication factor leads to a specific condition, it calls another function `func_2` with specific parameters. If no triplet meets the criteria, it calls `func_2` with 'NO'. The function does not return any values directly but may lead to multiple calls to `func_2` with various parameters based on the conditions met.**
