The function `func_2` is called with arguments `-i * mul2` and `j * mul2`. The values of `mul2` is determined by `b // k`, and since `b` and `k` are both integers between 1 and 1000, `mul2` will also be a non-negative integer. The values of `i` and `j` are from a valid triplet, meaning they are also integers within the specified bounds.

The output state reflects the fact that the values of `mul2`, `-i * mul2`, and `j * mul2` are computed based on the initial state, but the exact values depend on the specific integers of `i`, `j`, `b`, and `k`.

Since `mul2` is computed as `b // k`, `-i * mul2` will be a non-positive integer (since `i` is multiplied by a non-negative `mul2`), and `j * mul2` will be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, we can summarize the output state as:

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `trips` contains at least 1 valid triplet, `i` is the second element of the triplet, `j` is the first element of the triplet, `k` is the third element of the triplet, `mul1` is `a // k`, `mul2` is `b // k`, `func_2` is called with arguments `-i * mul2` and `j * mul2`.**
