The value of `at_start` is set to False, but it was already False in the initial state, so there is no change to its value. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is a space; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is a space; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False.**
