`mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`, where `b` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000 and `k` is a divisor. The value of `mul2` depends on the specific values of `b` and `k`, but it will be the integer division of `b` by `k`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `mul1` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `b` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `k` is a divisor; `mul1` is the result of `a // k; `mul2` is the result of `b // k`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `b` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `k` is a divisor; `mul1` is the result of `a // k; `mul2` is the result of `b // k.**
