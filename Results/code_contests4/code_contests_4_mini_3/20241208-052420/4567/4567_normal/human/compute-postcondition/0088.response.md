Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000 and both are divisible by `k`. If `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`, then `mul1` is the result of `a // k` and `mul2` is the result of `b // k`. If `i * mul1` is not equal to `mul2 * j`, the program returns None. There is no else part in the code.***
