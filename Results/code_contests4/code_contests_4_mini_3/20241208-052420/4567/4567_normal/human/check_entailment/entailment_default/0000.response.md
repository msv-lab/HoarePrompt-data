The problem description requires determining if a right triangle with integer legs \(a\) and \(b\) can be placed on a coordinate plane such that none of its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. If so, the program should output "YES" followed by the integer coordinates of the triangle's vertices. If not, it should output "NO".

### Initial Assessment of the Code

1. **Function `func_1`:** 
   - It generates all Pythagorean triplets with \(i\) and \(j\) ranging from 1 to 1000. 
   - For each triplet, it checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are divisible by the hypotenuse \(k\).
   - It performs a check to ensure that the triangle's placement condition (i.e., not having sides parallel to the axes) is valid by ensuring `i * mul1 != mul2 * j`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function merely prints the values passed to it, handling formatting.

### Edge Cases Considered
- The smallest case, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), leads to "NO" as it is impossible to place a triangle with such legs without parallel sides.
- Other cases, such as \(a = 5\) and \(b = 5\) or \(a = 5\) and \(b = 10\), return valid coordinates.

### Analysis of Output Hints

The hints describe that `func_1` checks for valid Pythagorean triplets and determines if the conditions for placing the triangle hold true. They indicate a failure to find valid placements in certain cases, such as the specific example of \(1, 1\) leading to "NO".

### Conclusion 

The way the program generates Pythagorean triplets and checks divisibility does not account for all scenarios under which a triangle can be formed. For instance, it does not handle cases where the triangle may be formed by a specific arrangement that might not conform to the triplet condition but still is valid. 

For example, when \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the program correctly outputs "NO," but it does not explore or validate configurations for all potential integer coordinates that might yield a valid triangle placement.

Thus, while the function captures some valid cases, it fails to account for all configurations where a triangle could be placed on the plane. Additionally, the reliance on checking for integer hypotenuses might miss some valid configurations that do not fit into the triplet paradigm.

Therefore, due to the inability to ensure correctness for all potential placements of the triangle and based on the insight that the output hints do not reinforce complete correctness:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases, particularly regarding different configurations of the triangle that could allow for non-parallel placements that are not captured by the Pythagorean conditions alone.
