Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Coordinate Generation Logic**: The program attempts to find integer coordinates for the vertices of a right triangle based on the Pythagorean triplets generated in `func_1`. However, it does not ensure that the triangle sides are not parallel to the coordinate axes as required. The only check it performs is ensuring that `i * (a // k) != (b // k) * j`, but this does not guarantee that the triangle formed by the coordinates will not have any sides parallel to the axes.

2. **Output Format**: The program does not follow the required output format strictly. It uses a function (`func_2`) to print values, which does not seem to be well-defined in the context of the problem. The problem specifies that if itâ€™s possible to place the triangle, the output should include "YES" followed by the coordinates of the vertices. The program may potentially print incorrect values or the wrong format due to the way `func_2` is used.

3. **No Handling for Non-Existence Cases**: When the triangle cannot be placed according to the requirements, the program correctly outputs "NO". However, the mechanism for outputting coordinates of the triangle is flawed as it could potentially lead to incorrect configurations being printed.

In summary, the program does not guarantee that the triangle is positioned such that none of its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, nor does it adhere strictly to the output requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the correctness criteria as defined.
