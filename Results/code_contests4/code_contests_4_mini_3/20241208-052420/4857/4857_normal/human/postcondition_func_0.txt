The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^4). It then calculates how many times it can successively subtract increasing integers (1, 2, 3, ...) from `x` until `x` becomes less than the next integer to subtract. The final count of successful subtractions is printed.
