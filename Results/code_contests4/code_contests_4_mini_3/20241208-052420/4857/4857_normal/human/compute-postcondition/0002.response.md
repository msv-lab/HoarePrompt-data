`k` is assigned the value of 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0; `k` is 1.  
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0; `k` is 1**
