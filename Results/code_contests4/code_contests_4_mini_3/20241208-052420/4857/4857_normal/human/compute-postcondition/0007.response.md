`c` is assigned the value of `c + 1`. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, and `x`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `k` is 1, `c` is 1, and `x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `k` is 1, `c` is 1, and `x` is decreased by 1.**
