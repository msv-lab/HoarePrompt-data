To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze how the variables change during each iteration based on the provided code and the values after the first few iterations.

The loop code provided is:
```
while x - (i + k) >= 0:
    i = i + k
    x = x - i
    c = c + 1
    k = k + 1
```

1. **Loop Control Conditions**: The loop continues while `x - (i + k) >= 0`. Therefore, the loop will terminate when this condition is no longer true, meaning `x` is less than `i + k`.

2. **Variable Updates**: 
   - `i` is incremented by `k` on each iteration.
   - `x` is decremented by the new value of `i`.
   - `c` counts the number of iterations.
   - `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Final State**: 
   - The while loop will stop once `x` is less than `i + k`. 
   - At this point, `c` will reflect the total number of times the loop executed.

Given the nature of the loop, we can summarize the final state based on the pattern observed in the iterations:

- `c` will be the total number of complete iterations executed.
- `i` will contain the last value incremented by `k` before the loop condition fails.
- `k` will be one more than the last value used in the loop (as it is incremented after each iteration).
- `x` will be less than `i + k`, which indicates that the loop has finished executing.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is the last value reached before termination, `k` is the value of `k` incremented once after the last successful iteration, `c` is the total count of iterations, and `x` is the remaining value that is less than `i + k`.**
