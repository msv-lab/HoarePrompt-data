To determine the conditions for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `x - (i + k) >= 0`.

1. Before the loop, the values are:
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4 (this value does not impact the loop execution).
   - `x` is an input integer (the exact value is unknown).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `c` is 0 (this value does not impact the loop execution).

2. The loop will execute if:
   \[
   x - (i + k) \geq 0
   \]
   Substituting the known values of `i` and `k`, we get:
   \[
   x - (0 + 1) \geq 0 \implies x - 1 \geq 0 \implies x \geq 1
   \]

3. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `x` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `x` must be greater than or equal to 1**
