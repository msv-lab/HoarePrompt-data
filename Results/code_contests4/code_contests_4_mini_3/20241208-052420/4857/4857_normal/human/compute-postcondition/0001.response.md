The variable `i` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `n` and `x` are unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0**
