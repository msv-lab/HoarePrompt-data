The value of `i` is incremented by `k`, which is 3. Thus, `i` will be updated from 3 to 6 (3 + 3). The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `c`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 6, `k` is 3, `c` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `x` is at least 6.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 6, `k` is 3, `c` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `x` is at least 6.**
