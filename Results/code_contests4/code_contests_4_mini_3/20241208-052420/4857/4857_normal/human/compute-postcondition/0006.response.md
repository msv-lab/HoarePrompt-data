The variable `x` is being decremented by the value of `i`. However, the initial value of `x` is not provided in the initial state. Since `i` is known to be 1, the operation changes `x` to `x - 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `x` while indicating that the value of `x` is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `k` is 1, `c` is 0, and `x` is decreased by 1 (new value of x is x - 1)**
