The variable `x` is assigned the value of `x - i`. The initial value of `i` is 3. Since `x` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, we can assume that `x` is at least 3. Therefore, after executing the code, `x` will be reduced by 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `c`) are not affected. 

The Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `k` is 2, `c` is 1, and `x` is at least 0 (since `x` was at least 3 before the operation).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `k` is 2, `c` is 1, `x` is at least 0**
