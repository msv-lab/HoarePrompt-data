The value of `i` is incremented by `k`, which is 2. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after the execution, `i` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `k` is 2, `c` is 1, and `x` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `k` is 2, `c` is 1, and `x` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.**
