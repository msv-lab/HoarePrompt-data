`k` is assigned the value `k + 1`. The previous value of `k` is 1, so after execution, `k` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `c` is 1, and `x` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `c` is 1, and `x` is decreased by 1.**
