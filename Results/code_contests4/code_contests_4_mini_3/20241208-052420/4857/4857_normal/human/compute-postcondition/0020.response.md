Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `i` is the last value reached before termination, `k` is the value of `k` incremented once after the last successful iteration, `c` is the total count of iterations, and `x` is the remaining value that is less than `i + k; the value of `c` is printed.**
