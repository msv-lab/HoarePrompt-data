To evaluate the correctness of the provided program for the "Durak" card game, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. The program needs to determine if the first card beats the second card based on the rules:
   - A card can beat another card of the same suit if it has a higher rank.
   - A trump card can beat any non-trump card.

### Code Analysis:
```python
coz = raw_input()  # Trump suit
(f, s) = raw_input().split()  # Two cards input
d = {'6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}  # Rank dictionary
if f[1] == coz and s[1] != coz:  # Case where first card is trump and second card is not
    print('YES')
elif f[1] != coz and s[1] == coz:  # Case where first card is not trump and second card is trump
    print('NO')
elif f[1] == s[1] and [f[0]] > d[s[0]]:  # Case where both cards are of the same suit
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Issues Identified:
1. The condition `elif f[1] == s[1] and [f[0]] > d[s[0]]:` is incorrect. The expression `[f[0]]` is creating a list with one element (the rank of the first card), and this will not compare correctly with the integer value from the dictionary `d[s[0]]`. It should simply be `d[f[0]] > d[s[0]]`.

2. The program does not handle cases where both cards are trump cards. According to the rules:
   - If both cards are of the trump suit, the one with the higher rank should win, which is not considered in the current logic.

### Example Case Where Code Fails:
- Input: 
  ```
  H
  AH KH
  ```
  Expected Output: `YES` (since AH beats KH, both are trump cards)
  Actual Output: `NO` (because it does not handle the trump vs trump case).

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the example where the program does not meet the problem requirements, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
