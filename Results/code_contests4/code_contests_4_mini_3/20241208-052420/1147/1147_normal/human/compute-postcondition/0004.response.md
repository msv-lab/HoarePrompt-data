The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string "YES" to the console. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `trump_suit` is a character representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D", or "C"); `card1` is a string consisting of two characters; `card2` is a string consisting of two characters; `coz` is an input string; `f` and `s` are input strings obtained from splitting the input; `d` is a dictionary mapping card values to their corresponding integers; `f[1]` is equal to `coz`; `s[1]` is not equal to `coz`, and "YES" has been printed.
