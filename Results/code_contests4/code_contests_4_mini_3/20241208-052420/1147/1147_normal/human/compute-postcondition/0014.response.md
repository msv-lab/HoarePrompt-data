Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a character representing the trump suit ("S", "H", "D", or "C"); `card1` is a string consisting of two characters; `card2` is a string consisting of two characters; `coz` is an input string; `f` and `s` are input strings obtained from splitting the input; `d` is a dictionary mapping card values to their corresponding integers. If `f[1]` is not equal to `coz` and `s[1]` is equal to `coz`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `f[1]` is equal to `s[1]` and the integer value of `f[0]` is greater than the integer value of `d[s[0]]`, then 'YES' is printed. If `f[1]` is not equal to `s[1]`, and `f[0]` is greater than `d[s[0]]`, and either `f[1]` is equal to `coz` or `s[1]` is not equal to `coz`, then 'NO' is printed.***
