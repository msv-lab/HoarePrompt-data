The function accepts input for a trump suit and two cards, each represented as two-character strings. It evaluates the suits and ranks of the cards against the trump suit and prints either "YES" or "NO" based on the following conditions: If the first card's suit is the trump suit and the second card's suit is not, it prints "YES". If the first card's suit is not the trump suit and the second card's suit is the trump suit, it prints "NO". If both cards have the same suit, it checks if the rank of the first card is greater than the rank of the second card; if so, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the result directly to the output. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or invalid ranks/suits are provided, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
