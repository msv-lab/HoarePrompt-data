Correctness: **False**.

The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly counting the number of islands in the provided datasets:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This will cause an error when running the program in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Array Initialization**: The program initializes the grid `g` as a list of lists but does not properly populate it if the input is not formatted correctly. The program assumes that there will always be 12 lines of input for each dataset without any checks for blank lines.

3. **Boundary Checking**: The function `func_1` checks if `y` and `x` are within bounds but does not account for the case where either coordinate might be out of bounds due to the way the input is processed or due to improper input (like fewer than 12 lines).

4. **Infinite Loop**: The `while 1:` loop will continue indefinitely if the input is malformed or if there's an issue with the dataset formatting. This can lead to an infinite loop if no valid input is provided.

5. **Use of `xrange()`:** The program uses `xrange()` which is not available in Python 3; it should use `range()` instead.

6. **Output Formatting**: The program does not correctly handle the case where there is a blank line between datasets, which can lead to incorrect behavior when counting islands if the last dataset is followed by a blank line.

An example case that would fail is if the input for a dataset consists of fewer than 12 lines or if there are unexpected characters. The program would either throw an error or produce incorrect output.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
