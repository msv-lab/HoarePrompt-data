You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a plan view consisting of 12 vertical and 12 horizontal squares showing the terrain. Each square is painted white or black. White represents the sea and black represents the land. When two black squares touch each other vertically or horizontally, they are said to be continuous. In this plan view, the area created by only one black square or a continuous black square is called an "island". For example, in the figure below, there are five islands.

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. One plan view is given for each dataset. A plan view is represented by 12 rows of 12 number columns, with black squares represented by 1 and white squares represented by 0. The datasets are separated by a single blank line.

The number of datasets does not exceed 20.

Output

Outputs the number of islands on one line for each dataset.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: y is a list of 12 strings, each containing 12 characters where each character is either '1' (representing land) or '0' (representing sea). x is an integer representing the dataset index, and it can range from 0 to the number of datasets minus one. The number of datasets does not exceed 20.
def func_1(y, x):
    if (0 <= y <= 11 and 0 <= x <= 11) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`y` is a list of 12 strings, each containing 12 characters where each character is either '1' (representing land) or '0' (representing sea), `x` is an integer representing the dataset index, and it can range from 0 to the number of datasets minus one. The value of `y` does not satisfy the condition of being between 0 and 11, or the value of `x` is less than 0 or greater than 11. The number of datasets does not exceed 20.
    return False
    #The program returns False because the value of `y` does not satisfy the condition of being between 0 and 11, or the value of `x` is less than 0 or greater than 11.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: y and x are integers representing the number of rows and columns respectively, where y and x are both equal to 12. The input consists of multiple datasets, with each dataset representing a 12x12 grid of integers, where each integer is either 0 (white square) or 1 (black square). The number of datasets does not exceed 20.
def func_2(y, x):
    if (g[y][x] == '0') :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating the value at position g[12][12] is a white square.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`y` and `x` are integers representing the number of rows and columns respectively, both equal to 12. The input consists of multiple datasets representing a 12x12 grid of integers, where each integer is either 0 (white square) or 1 (black square). The value at position `g[12][12]` is not equal to '0'.
    g[y][x] = '0'
    for i in xrange(4):
        nexty = y + dy[i]
        
        nextx = x + dx[i]
        
        if not func_1(nexty, nextx):
            continue
        
        if visited[nexty][nextx] == 0 and g[nexty][nextx] == '1':
            visited[nexty][nextx] = 1
            func_2(nexty, nextx)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 4, `visited` remains unchanged, and `func_2` is called only if valid conditions for `nexty` and `nextx` are met during the iterations.
    return 1
    #The program returns the integer 1


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
