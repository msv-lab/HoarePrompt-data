Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to count the number of islands in the given 12x12 grid as described in the problem statement. Here are several reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Handling**: The function `func_1` is intended to check if the indices are within valid bounds for the grid, but its implementation and purpose are unclear and do not directly contribute to counting islands. The check `(0 <= y <= 11 and 0 <= x <= 11)` seems to check if `y` is within the range of indices, but it is incorrectly checking `y` against itself instead of the grid's height.

2. **Grid Access**: In `func_2`, the program attempts to access `g[y][x]`, but it does not define or initialize `g`, leading to potential errors. The grid should be passed as a parameter to the function.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The condition checks for `nexty` and `nextx` that involve calls to `func_1` are incorrect because `func_1` is not effectively checking the boundaries of the grid based on the intended coordinates.

4. **Recursive Logic**: The recursive call to `func_2` does not track the number of islands correctly. The logic to increment the island count is not properly implemented since the function's return value does not accumulate the count of islands.

5. **Non-Return Values**: The method for returning the count of islands is flawed. The return values of `0` and `1` do not properly reflect the number of islands found in the dataset.

6. **Input Parsing**: There is no mechanism to handle multiple datasets or to parse the input correctly according to the specifications given in the problem description, which specifies that there can be multiple datasets separated by blank lines.

Overall, the program fails to fulfill the requirements of the problem description as it does not correctly initialize the grid, handle the boundaries, count the islands, or manage multiple datasets accurately. Hence, it does not meet the expected functionality.
