#State of the program right berfore the function call: y is a list of 12 strings, each containing 12 characters where each character is either '1' (representing land) or '0' (representing sea). x is an integer representing the dataset index, and it can range from 0 to the number of datasets minus one. The number of datasets does not exceed 20.
def func_1(y, x):
    if (0 <= y <= 11 and 0 <= x <= 11) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`y` is a list of 12 strings, each containing 12 characters where each character is either '1' (representing land) or '0' (representing sea), `x` is an integer representing the dataset index, and it can range from 0 to the number of datasets minus one. The value of `y` does not satisfy the condition of being between 0 and 11, or the value of `x` is less than 0 or greater than 11. The number of datasets does not exceed 20.
    return False
    #The program returns False because the value of `y` does not satisfy the condition of being between 0 and 11, or the value of `x` is less than 0 or greater than 11.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `y`, where each string contains 12 characters (either '1' or '0'), and an integer `x` representing an index. It returns `True` if `x` is between 0 and 11 (inclusive), but the condition for `y` is incorrectly stated in the annotations; it should check if `y` is a valid list of strings instead of being a number between 0 and 11. The function will return `False` if `x` is outside the range of 0 to 11, regardless of the content of `y`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: y and x are integers representing the number of rows and columns respectively, where y and x are both equal to 12. The input consists of multiple datasets, with each dataset representing a 12x12 grid of integers, where each integer is either 0 (white square) or 1 (black square). The number of datasets does not exceed 20.
def func_2(y, x):
    if (g[y][x] == '0') :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating the value at position g[12][12] is a white square.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`y` and `x` are integers representing the number of rows and columns respectively, both equal to 12. The input consists of multiple datasets representing a 12x12 grid of integers, where each integer is either 0 (white square) or 1 (black square). The value at position `g[12][12]` is not equal to '0'.
    g[y][x] = '0'
    for i in xrange(4):
        nexty = y + dy[i]
        
        nextx = x + dx[i]
        
        if not func_1(nexty, nextx):
            continue
        
        if visited[nexty][nextx] == 0 and g[nexty][nextx] == '1':
            visited[nexty][nextx] = 1
            func_2(nexty, nextx)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 4, `visited` remains unchanged, and `func_2` is called only if valid conditions for `nexty` and `nextx` are met during the iterations.
    return 1
    #The program returns the integer 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `y` and `x`, representing the coordinates in a 12x12 grid of integers. It returns 0 if the value at position `g[y][x]` is '0' (indicating a white square); otherwise, it marks that position as visited, processes neighboring positions recursively, and returns 1. If the grid value at `g[y][x]` is '1' (a black square), it continues to explore adjacent squares and will eventually return 1 if the initial position is valid. However, it does not handle cases where `y` and `x` are out of bounds or when the grid is not properly initialized, which could lead to errors.
