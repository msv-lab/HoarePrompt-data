The variable `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`. The value of `x` is 12, and `dx[i]` needs to be evaluated. Since `i` is 1, we need the value of `dx[1]`. However, `dx` is not defined in the initial state provided, so we cannot determine the exact value for `nextx`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nextx` cannot be computed definitively without knowing `dx[1]`.

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 1, `nexty` is 12 + dy[1], `nextx` is undefined due to unknown dx[1]**
