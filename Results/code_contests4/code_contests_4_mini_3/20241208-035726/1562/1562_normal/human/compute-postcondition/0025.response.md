The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 2, `nexty` cannot be computed without the definition of `dy`, and `nextx` cannot be computed without the definition of `dx`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
