Postcondition: ***`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 0, `nexty` is 12 + dy[0], `nextx` is 12 + dx[0]. If `visited[nexty][nextx]` was 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', then `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1 and `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is called. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
