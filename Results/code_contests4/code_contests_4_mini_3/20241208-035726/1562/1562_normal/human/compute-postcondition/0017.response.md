The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. The variable `nextx` remains undefined due to the unknown `dx[1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 1, `nexty` is 12 + dy[1], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 1, `nexty` is 12 + dy[1], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
