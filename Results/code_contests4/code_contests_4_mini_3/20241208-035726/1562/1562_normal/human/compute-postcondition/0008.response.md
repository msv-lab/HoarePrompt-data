The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since it does not change any variable values directly, the values of the affected variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State reflects that we skip to the next iteration of the loop but does not affect the variable states.

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 0, `nexty` is 12 + dy[0], `nextx` is 12 + dx[0], and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
