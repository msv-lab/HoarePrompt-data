`nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`. The value of `x` is 12, and `i` is 0, but `dx[i]` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot specify the exact value of `nextx` without knowing `dx[0]`. As a result, the output state reflects the uncertainty regarding `nextx`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 0, `nexty` is 12 + dy[0], and `nextx` is 12 + dx[0] (where dx[0] is unknown).**
