To analyze the provided code snippet, we look at the initial state:

- `y` is 12
- `x` is 12
- `g[12][12]` is '0'
- `i` is 1
- `nexty` is 12 + dy[0]
- `nextx` is 12 + dx[0]

Now, the code snippet is:
```
nexty = y + dy[i]
```

We need to evaluate `nexty`. The variable `i` is currently 1. We need to consider the value of `dy[1]` to compute `nexty`.

Assuming `dy` is defined elsewhere in the program and holds values at least for index 0 and 1, let's denote the value of `dy[1]` as `dy_value`.

Calculating `nexty`:
- `nexty = y + dy[i]` becomes `nexty = 12 + dy_value`.

The output state would then depend on the specific value of `dy[1]`. However, since we donâ€™t have the exact value of `dy[1]`, we can only express `nexty` in terms of `dy[1]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nexty` based on the initial values and the computation.

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 1, `nexty` is 12 + dy[1], `nextx` is 12 + dx[0]**
