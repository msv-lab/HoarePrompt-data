The code assigns `nexty` the value of `y + dy[i]`. The current value of `y` is 12, and since `i` is 2, we need to know the value of `dy[2]`. However, based on the initial state, `dy` is not defined. Therefore, we cannot calculate `nexty` directly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 2, and `nexty` cannot be computed without the definition of `dy`**.
