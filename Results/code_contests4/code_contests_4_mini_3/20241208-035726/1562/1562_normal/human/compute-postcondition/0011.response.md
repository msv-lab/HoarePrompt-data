The code assigns the value `1` to `visited[nexty][nextx]`, where `nexty` is calculated as `12 + dy[0]` and `nextx` as `12 + dx[0]`. Since `visited[nexty][nextx]` is initially `0`, it changes to `1`. The values of `y`, `x`, `g[12][12]`, `i`, `nexty`, and `nextx` remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 0, `nexty` is 12 + dy[0], `nextx` is 12 + dx[0], `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1 (previously 0).

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 0, `nexty` is 12 + dy[0], `nextx` is 12 + dx[0], `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1 (previously 0)**.
