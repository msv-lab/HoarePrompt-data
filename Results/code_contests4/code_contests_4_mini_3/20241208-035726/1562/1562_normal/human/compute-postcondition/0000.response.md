Postcondition: ***`y` and `x` are integers representing the number of rows and columns respectively, both equal to 12. The grid `g` consists of multiple datasets, each representing a 12x12 grid of integers where each integer is either 0 (white square) or 1 (black square). The value at position `g[12][12]` is 0 (indicating a white square). The number of datasets does not exceed 20.***
