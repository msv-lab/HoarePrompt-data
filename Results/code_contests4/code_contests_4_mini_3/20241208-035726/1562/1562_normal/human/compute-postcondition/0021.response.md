Postcondition: ***`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 1. If `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', then `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1 and `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is called. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `visited[nexty][nextx]` or the function calls.***
