The value of `dy[i]` is not explicitly provided, but since `i` is 0, we need to consider the value of `dy[0]`. Assuming `dy[0]` is a known value (let's denote it as `dy0`), we can calculate `nexty`.

`nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`, where `y` is 12 and `i` is 0. Thus, `nexty` will be `12 + dy[0]`.

The output state will depend on the value of `dy[0]`. Since we do not have that specific value, we will indicate that the resulting value of `nexty` is dependent on `dy[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 0, and `nexty` is `12 + dy[0]`.

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 0, and `nexty` is `12 + dy[0]`**.
