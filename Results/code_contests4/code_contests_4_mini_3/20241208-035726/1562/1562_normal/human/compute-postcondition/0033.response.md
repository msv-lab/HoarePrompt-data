Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `y` and `x`, representing the coordinates in a 12x12 grid of integers. It returns 0 if the value at position `g[y][x]` is '0' (indicating a white square); otherwise, it marks that position as visited, processes neighboring positions recursively, and returns 1. If the grid value at `g[y][x]` is '1' (a black square), it continues to explore adjacent squares and will eventually return 1 if the initial position is valid. However, it does not handle cases where `y` and `x` are out of bounds or when the grid is not properly initialized, which could lead to errors.**
