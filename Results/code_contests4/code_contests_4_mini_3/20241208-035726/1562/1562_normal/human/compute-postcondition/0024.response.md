The value of `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`. The value of `x` is 12, but the value of `dx[i]` cannot be determined because `dx` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 2, and `nexty` cannot be computed without the definition of `dy`, and `nextx` cannot be computed without the definition of `dx`.

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 2, `nexty` cannot be computed without the definition of `dy`, and `nextx` cannot be computed without the definition of `dx`.**
