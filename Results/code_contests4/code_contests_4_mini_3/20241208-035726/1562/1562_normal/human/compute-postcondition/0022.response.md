According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will run while `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

So, if `i` is incremented from 1 to 2, the loop can execute again. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than 4, which it will be after this increment.

State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `g[12][12]` is '0', `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 4**
