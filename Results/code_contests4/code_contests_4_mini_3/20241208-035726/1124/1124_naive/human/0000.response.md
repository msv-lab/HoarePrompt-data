To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we can analyze the code step-by-step.

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum difficulty of a rock climbing track after removing one hold from a list of heights. The difficulty is defined as the maximum distance between adjacent holds after one hold is removed.

Let's examine the program:

1. The function `func_1(lst, c)` is designed to calculate the maximum difference in heights after removing certain holds specified by the indices in `c`.
2. It checks if the first and last holds are included in `c` and calculates the maximum difference between adjacent holds in `temp`, which is generated from the original list `lst` based on the indices in `c`.
3. The main program generates all possible combinations of indices to remove (except for the first and last hold) using `itertools.combinations`.
4. It attempts to find the minimum maximum difference (difficulty) across all combinations.

However, there are several issues in the implementation:

1. The program does not handle the case where only the first and last holds are retained. It assumes that at least one hold must be removed, but if there are only three holds, removing the middle one is the only option. The check `if 0 in c and n - 1 in c:` does not properly ensure that we're only considering valid combinations.
2. The use of `awk = 10000000000` as an initial value is arbitrary and could lead to incorrect logic if all differences are larger than this value.
3. The function does not return the correct result if `awk` remains `-1` after evaluating the differences, which suggests an error in the logic or handling of combinations.

To illustrate a potential failure case:
- Input: `3` followed by `1 4 6`
- Expected Output: `5` (by removing the middle hold)
- The program may fail to correctly compute this due to the aforementioned issues with combinations and checks.

Given these points, the program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
