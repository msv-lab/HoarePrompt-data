Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold. There are several issues with the program:

1. **Logic for Removing Holds**: The program attempts to handle the removal of holds by generating combinations of the indices of the holds, but it does not correctly ensure that the first and last holds (indices 0 and n-1) are always included. The logic in `func_1` checks if both the first and last indices are in `c`, but this is not guaranteed in the combinations generated, leading to potential cases where the first or last hold is removed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Height List**: The `lst` variable is created using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, but `map` returns a map object in Python 3. This should be converted to a list explicitly. If the program is run in Python 3, it will raise an error due to trying to access elements of a map object.

3. **Difficulty Calculation**: The calculation of the maximum difference between adjacent holds after removing one hold is not correctly implemented. The program does not properly compute the maximum difference for all valid combinations that respect the requirements.

To illustrate these problems, consider the case:
```
Input:
4
1 2 3 5
```
The expected output is `2`, since removing the hold at height `3` leaves the sequence `1, 2, 5` with maximum difficulty `3`. However, the program may not account for this scenario correctly due to the issues outlined above.

Overall, the program fails to account for the requirement of keeping the first and last holds and may produce incorrect results or errors depending on the specific input.
