Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Indices**: The program is attempting to create a list `temp` from `lst` using a list of indices `c`, but `c` is passed as a single integer (the number of holds) rather than a list of indices. This will lead to an error because `for i in c:` would iteratively try to iterate over an integer.

2. **Logic for Removing Holds**: The logic used to determine the maximum difference between adjacent holds after removing a hold is flawed. The program checks if both the first and last indices are in the list `c`, but it does not iterate through all possible holds that could be removed (except the first and last ones). The problem requires checking the maximum distance between heights after removing each possible hold (except the first and last), which is not what the program does.

3. **Return Value**: The return value of `10000000000` is arbitrary and does not represent a meaningful result in the context of the problem. The program should compute and return the minimum difficulty based on the maximum distances after the removal of each hold, not a constant value.

4. **Lack of Minimum Difficulty Logic**: The program does not implement a way to track the minimum difficulty after testing all possible holds for removal. Instead, it only calculates one maximum difference.

In summary, the program does not follow the problem description because it does not correctly handle the logic for removing holds and calculating the minimum difficulty. The intended functionality is not achieved, which leads to incorrect results.
