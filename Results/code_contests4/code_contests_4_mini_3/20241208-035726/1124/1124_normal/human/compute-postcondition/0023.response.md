Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `lst` representing the heights of holds and a list `c` of indices. It returns the maximum difference between consecutive heights in `lst` at the specified indices if both the first and last indices are present in `c`. If either the first or last index is not present in `c`, it returns a constant value of 10000000000. **
