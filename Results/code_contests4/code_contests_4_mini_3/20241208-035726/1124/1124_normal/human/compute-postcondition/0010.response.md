According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `temp`. The loop will execute if `temp` has at least one element, meaning its length should be greater than 0. 

Given that `i` is the last index accessed from `c`, the initial state of `i` should be set to 0 to allow the loop to execute for the first time, as the loop starts iterating from index 0.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `temp` is not empty. We already know from the initial state that `0` is an element of `c` and `n - 1` is also an element of `c`, which implies that there are valid indices. 

State: **`temp` is a list containing elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, for the loop to execute the first time `temp` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `awk` is -1**
