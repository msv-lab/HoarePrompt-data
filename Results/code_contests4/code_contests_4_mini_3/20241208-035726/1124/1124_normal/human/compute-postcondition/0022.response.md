The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `c`. The parameter `lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of holds, where the length of `lst` is `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the elements of `lst` are strictly increasing integers (1 ≤ lst[i] ≤ 1000). The parameter `c` is an integer that denotes the number of holds, and it must be equal to `len(lst)`. 

After executing the function body, if Case_1 is fulfilled, the function returns the constant value `10000000000`. If Case_2 is fulfilled, the function returns the value of the variable `awk`, which is not equal to `-1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of strictly increasing integers representing heights of holds and an integer denoting the number of holds, returning either a constant value or the value of a variable based on certain conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` representing heights of holds and an integer `c` denoting the number of holds, returning `10000000000` or the value of a variable `awk` based on specific conditions.**
