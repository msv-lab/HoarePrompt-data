The code `temp.append(lst[i])` appends the value of `lst` at index `i` to the list `temp`. Given that `i` is 2, this means the third element of `lst` (since indexing starts at 0) will be added to `temp`. The previous values of `temp` will be updated to include this new element. 

The other variables, `lst` and `c`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated list `temp`, which now contains its original elements plus the element from `lst` at index 2.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `c` is greater than 2; `temp` is now a list containing the first element of `lst`, followed by the second element of `lst`, followed by the third element of `lst` (lst[2]); `i` is 2**
