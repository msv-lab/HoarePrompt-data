The value of `temp` is modified by appending the element of `lst` at index `i`. Since `i` is either 0 or the first element of `c` (assuming `c` is a list), `temp` will have the first element of `lst` added to it. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `c` is greater than 0, `temp` is now a list containing the first element of `lst`, `i` is 0 (or the first element of `c`).

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `c` is greater than 0, `temp` is now a list containing the first element of `lst`, `i` is 0 (or the first element of `c`)**
