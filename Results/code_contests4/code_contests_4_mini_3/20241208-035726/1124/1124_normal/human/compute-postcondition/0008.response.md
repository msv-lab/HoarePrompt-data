The variable `awk` is assigned the value -1. The previous values of `temp`, `c`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is a list containing the elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, `c` is a list of indices, `i` is the last index accessed from `c`, and `awk` is -1. 

Output State: **`temp` is a list containing the elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, `c` is a list of indices, `i` is the last index accessed from `c`, and `awk` is -1.**
