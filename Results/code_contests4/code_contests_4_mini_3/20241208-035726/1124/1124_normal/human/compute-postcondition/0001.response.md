According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. The `for` loop iterates over `c`, which should be an iterable (like a list or range). If `c` is an integer, it must be converted to a range or an iterable form in order for the loop to execute.

Since `temp` is an empty list and `lst` is a list of integers, the condition for the loop to execute would be that `c` should be a positive integer or an iterable that can provide values. If `c` is an integer greater than 0, the loop will execute `c` times.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `c` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0 (if `c` is treated as a range) or the first element in `c` if `c` is a list.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `c` is greater than 0, `temp` is an empty list, `i` is 0 (or the first element of c if c is a list)**
