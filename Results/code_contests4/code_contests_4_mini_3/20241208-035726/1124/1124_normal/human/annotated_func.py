#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers representing the heights of holds, where the length of lst is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the elements of lst are strictly increasing integers (1 ≤ lst[i] ≤ 1000). c is an integer that denotes the number of holds, and it must be equal to len(lst).
def func_1(lst, c):
    temp = []
    for i in c:
        temp.append(lst[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` is a list containing the elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, `c` is a list of indices, `i` is the last index accessed from `c` (or the last element of `c`).
    awk = -1
    if (0 in c and n - 1 in c) :
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            awk = max(awk, temp[i] - temp[i - 1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `temp`, `temp` contains the elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`temp` is a list containing the elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`. If both 0 and `n - 1` are in `c`, then `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `temp`.
    if (awk == -1) :
        return 10000000000
        #The program returns the constant value 10000000000
    else :
        return awk
        #The program returns the value of variable 'awk', which is not equal to -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` representing the heights of holds and a list `c` of indices. It returns the maximum difference between consecutive heights in `lst` at the specified indices if both the first and last indices are present in `c`. If either the first or last index is not present in `c`, it returns a constant value of 10000000000.
