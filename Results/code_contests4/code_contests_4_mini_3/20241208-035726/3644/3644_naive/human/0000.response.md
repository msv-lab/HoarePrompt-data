Correctness: **False**.

The provided program outputs a series of answers ("YES" or "NO") without performing any analysis of the input photographs as described in the problem statement. The description requires the program to determine if the top half of an image has been swapped with the bottom half, but the program simply outputs predefined results.

For example, if the input photograph is:

```
h = 4, w = 4
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
255 255 255 255
255 255 255 255
```

This photograph has not been rearranged, but if the program doesn't check the actual pixel values and instead outputs "YES" or "NO" based on a static list, it will fail to give the correct output for this and many other valid inputs.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for correctly analyzing photographs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
