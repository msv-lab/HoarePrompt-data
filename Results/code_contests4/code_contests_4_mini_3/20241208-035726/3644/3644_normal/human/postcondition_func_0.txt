The function processes a number of questions about photographs, each described by its height and width, along with corresponding pixel brightness values. It appears to output a series of "YES" or "NO" responses based on the results of these processes, but the specific criteria for generating these responses is not defined in the provided snippet. The function does not explicitly take any parameters nor does it return any values, implying it may rely on external input or state.
