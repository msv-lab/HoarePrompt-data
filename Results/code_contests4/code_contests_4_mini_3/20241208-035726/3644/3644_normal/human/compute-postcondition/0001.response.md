The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it processes a number of questions `q`, where each question provides a photograph described by its height `h` and width `w`. Each photograph consists of `h` rows of `w` space-separated integers that represent pixel brightness values. The constraints specify that `1 ≤ q ≤ 220`, `1 ≤ h, w ≤ 600`, and `0 ≤ aij < 256`, with `h` being guaranteed to be even.

The functionality of the function is to handle multiple questions regarding photographs, analyzing the pixel brightness values provided in a structured format. However, the exact output based on the processing of these photographs is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple questions about photographs, each described by height and width, along with corresponding pixel brightness values.**
