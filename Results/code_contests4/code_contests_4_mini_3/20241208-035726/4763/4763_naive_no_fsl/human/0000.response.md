To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the functions, particularly `func_3`, which is responsible for checking if the bitstring can be made k-balanced.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if we can replace '?' in the string with '0' or '1' such that every substring of size `k` has an equal number of '0's and '1's.

2. **Function `func_3` Logic**:
   - It iterates through the string, checking each character.
   - If the character is '0' or '1', it attempts to propagate this value to all positions in the string that are spaced `k` apart (i.e., indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`).
   - If it encounters a conflicting character (e.g., a '0' where a '1' is already established), it returns `False`.
   - If it only finds '?' at these indices, it fills them based on the established character.
   - Finally, it counts the occurrences of '0's, '1's, and '?' in the first `k` characters and checks if they can be balanced.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - A critical part of the logic is missing: the program does not check if after replacing '?' it can actually achieve a balanced state. For example, if there are too many '1's or '0's already established, it may not be possible to balance them, even if '?' exists.
   - Moreover, it only checks the first `k` characters for balance without ensuring that all substrings of length `k` across the entire string can be balanced.

### Counterexample

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
6 4
111???  # Only 3 '?' but 3 '1's already
```
In this case, we have three '1's and only three '?' to replace. No matter how we replace the '?' with '0's or '1's, we cannot achieve a k-balanced string since we would need 2 '0's and 2 '1's in every window of size `4`. 

The expected output should be `NO` since we cannot replace the '?' to achieve balance, but the program may return `YES` due to how it processes the '?'.

### Conclusion

Based on this analysis, the program does not correctly handle the balance requirement across the entire string for every potential case, especially when there are conflicting established values. 

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
