The function accepts an integer `n` and returns an array where each index `i` contains the smallest prime factor of `i` for the range from 2 to `n`. For indices less than 2, it returns 1. The function assumes that `n` is 4 or greater but does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, which could lead to an incomplete representation of prime factors for those indices.
