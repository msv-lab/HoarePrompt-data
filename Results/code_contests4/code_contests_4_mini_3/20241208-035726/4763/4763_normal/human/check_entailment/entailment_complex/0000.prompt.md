You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. A bitstring is called k-balanced if every substring of size k of this bitstring has an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters (k/2 of each).

You are given an integer k and a string s which is composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. You need to determine whether you can make a k-balanced bitstring by replacing every ? characters in s with either 0 or 1.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) — the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring.

The next line contains the string s (|s| = n). It is given that s consists of only 0, 1, and ?.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print YES if we can replace every ? in s with 0 or 1 such that the resulting bitstring is k-balanced, or NO if it is not possible.

Note

For the first test case, the string is already a 4-balanced bitstring.

For the second test case, the string can be transformed into 101.

For the fourth test case, the string can be transformed into 0110.

For the fifth test case, the string can be transformed into 1100110.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the length of the string s, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n, and s is a string of length n composed only of the characters '0', '1', and '?'.
def func_1(n):
    return set(reduce(list.__add__, ([i, n // i] for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5
    ) + 1) if n % i == 0)))
    #The program returns a set of divisors of the non-negative integer n, including both i and n // i for each divisor i found up to the square root of n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a set of all its divisors, including both `i` and `n // i` for each divisor `i` found up to the square root of `n`. It correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, returning an empty set since 0 has no positive divisors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the bitstring s, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, and s is a string of length n composed only of the characters '0', '1', and '?'.
def func_2(n):
    arr = [1] * n
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if arr[i] == 1:
            for j in range(i, n, i):
                arr[j] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `n` ≥ 4, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `arr` represents the smallest prime factor for each index in the range from 2 to `n` (1 for prime indices, and the index number for composite indices), with elements at indices < 2 remaining as 1.
    return arr
    #The program returns the smallest prime factor array 'arr' for each index in the range from 2 to n, with elements at indices < 2 remaining as 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns an array where each index `i` contains the smallest prime factor of `i` for the range from 2 to `n`. For indices less than 2, it returns 1. The function assumes that `n` is 4 or greater but does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, which could lead to an incomplete representation of prime factors for those indices.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, with k being even) and a string s (|s| = n) composed of characters '0', '1', and '?' such that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5. k is an even integer.

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != '?':
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                if arr[j] != arr[i] and arr[j] != '?':
                    return False
                if arr[j] == '?':
                    arr[j] = arr[i]
        else:
            vis = set([])
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                if arr[j] != '?':
                    vis.add(arr[j])
            if len(vis) == 2:
                return False
            if len(vis) == 1:

                    arr[j] = put
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list containing tuples where each tuple's first element is the integer `n` and the second element is a string composed of characters '0' and '1', with all '?' characters replaced by either '0' or '1' based on the conditions applied in the loop. If any inconsistency was found during the iterations, the function would have returned False, but since it completes without returning False, all '?' have been resolved appropriately.
    dic = {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}
    for i in range(k):
        dic[arr[i]] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is updated with the counts of '1', '0', and '?' based on the first elements of the tuples in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `k - 1` if `k` is greater than 0; if `k` is 0, `dic` remains unchanged and `i` is -1.
    if (dic['1'] != dic['0'] and dic['?'] != abs(dic['1'] - dic['0'])) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is updated with the counts of '1', '0', and '?', `i` is equal to `k - 1` if `k` is greater than 0; if `k` is 0, `dic` remains unchanged and `i` is -1. The counts of '1' and '0' in `dic` are equal, or the count of '?' in `dic` is equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '1' and '0'.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions involving counts of '1', '0', and '?' in 'dic' are satisfied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains an integer and a string composed of characters '0', '1', and '?', along with an even integer `k`. It processes the list to replace '?' characters with '0' or '1' based on specific rules and checks for inconsistencies. If any invalid scenarios arise during processing, it returns `False`. If there are no inconsistencies and the counts of '1', '0', and '?' satisfy specific conditions, it returns `True`. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty or where the string contains characters other than '0', '1', or '?', which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), for each test case n and k are integers (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even), and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?. The total length of all strings s across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(input())
        
        if not func_3(arr, k):
            func_5('NO')
        else:
            func_5('YES')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is at least 1; for each test case, `n` and `k` are input integers; `arr` is a list of characters from the input strings; `func_5` has been called with either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the result of `func_3(arr, k)` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing the characters '0', '1', and '?'. The function evaluates the string `s` using another function `func_3` with parameters `arr` (the character list of `s`) and `k`. If `func_3` returns False, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The results are generated for each test case, but the actual evaluation logic of `func_3` is not provided, meaning the behavior of the function depends on that external logic.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) representing the length of the string, and k is an even integer; s is a string of length n consisting only of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_5():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `args` is an iterable containing the elements, `file` has written the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is False.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `args` is an iterable containing the elements, `file` has written the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False; `file` has written `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file, and the flush operation is enabled because `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable number of arguments and keyword arguments. It writes the string representations of the provided arguments to a specified output file, separated by a specified separator. The function also writes a specified ending character after the arguments. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not process the input parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, or `s` as indicated in the annotations; instead, it focuses on outputting the provided `args` to the specified `file`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^4), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) and a string s of length n consisting only of characters '0', '1', and '?'.
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, s); `y` is assigned a value based on the invalid modulus operation, which leads to a type mismatch error, and the loop does not terminate.
    return x
    #The program returns the list 'x' containing at least one tuple (n, s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases, and a list `y` of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. However, the function contains a flaw that leads to an infinite loop due to an invalid modulus operation, resulting in a type mismatch error. Consequently, it does not return the expected list, and the program may not terminate properly. Thus, the functionality is incorrectly implemented and does not produce the intended output.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
