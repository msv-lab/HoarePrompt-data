Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. 

Upon reviewing the function `func_3`, which is responsible for determining if the string can be made k-balanced, there is a potential issue with how it handles the '?' characters. If there are multiple '?' characters in a substring of size k, the function does not correctly compute the necessary replacements to ensure that each substring of size k contains an equal number of '0's and '1's.

For example, consider the string `s = "1??0"` with `k = 4`. The function will not correctly determine that replacing the '?' characters could lead to a valid `k-balanced` string, as it might not effectively account for the need to balance the counts of '0' and '1' across all substrings of length `k`. 

Additionally, the function does not ensure that every possible '?' replacement maintains the `k-balanced` condition across overlapping substrings. This can lead to scenarios where the resulting string is not valid even though the function may return `True`.

The annotations highlight that the function does not handle cases where multiple replacements are needed, and that could lead to inconsistencies or violations of the k-balanced requirement.

Considering these points, the program fails to account for all edge cases and potential input scenarios outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
