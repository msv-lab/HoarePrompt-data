The function accepts an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases, and a list `y` of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. However, the function contains a flaw that leads to an infinite loop due to an invalid modulus operation, resulting in a type mismatch error. Consequently, it does not return the expected list, and the program may not terminate properly. Thus, the functionality is incorrectly implemented and does not produce the intended output.
