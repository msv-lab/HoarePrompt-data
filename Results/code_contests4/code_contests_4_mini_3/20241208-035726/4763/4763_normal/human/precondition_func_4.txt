t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) representing the length of the string, and k is an even integer; s is a string of length n consisting only of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
