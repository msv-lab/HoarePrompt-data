The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing the characters '0', '1', and '?'. The function evaluates the string `s` using another function `func_3` with parameters `arr` (the character list of `s`) and `k`. If `func_3` returns False, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The results are generated for each test case, but the actual evaluation logic of `func_3` is not provided, meaning the behavior of the function depends on that external logic.
