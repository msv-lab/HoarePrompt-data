According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `y` contains at least one tuple, which means it is not empty. Therefore, the loop can execute again without needing to adjust the state of `x` or `y`.

State: **`x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `y` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, s)**
