The variable `put` is assigned the first element of the list created from `vis`. Since the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `put` will take on that single value. The other variables `arr`, `i`, `j`, and `vis` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `j` is the last valid index accessed in `arr`, `vis` contains all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', and `put` is the single value contained in `vis`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `j` is the last valid index accessed in `arr`, `vis` contains all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `put` is the single value contained in `vis`.**
