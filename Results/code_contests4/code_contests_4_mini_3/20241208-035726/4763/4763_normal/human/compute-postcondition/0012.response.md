The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `at_start` was already `False`, so there is no change. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `args`, and `at_start` is now False.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `args`, `at_start` is False.**
