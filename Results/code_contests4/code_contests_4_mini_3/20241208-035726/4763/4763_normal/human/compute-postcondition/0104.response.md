The statement `arr[j] = arr[i]` assigns the value of `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the function would have previously returned False, but this assignment alters `arr[j]` to be equal to `arr[i]`, thus potentially preventing the return of False. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple; `arr[j]` is now equal to `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple; `arr[j]` is now equal to `arr[i]`**
