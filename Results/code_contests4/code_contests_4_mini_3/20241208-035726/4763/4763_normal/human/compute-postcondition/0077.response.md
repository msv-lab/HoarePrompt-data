Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the new value of `i`, and `vis` adds the element `arr[j]` to it, given that `len(arr)` is greater than `i + 1`. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', no changes occur to `i`, `j`, or `vis`.***
