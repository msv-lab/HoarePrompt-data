The function `func_6` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is an integer that represents the number of test cases, constrained to be between 1 and 10,000 (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^4). The parameter `y` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and `k` is even) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The function returns a list that contains at least one tuple (n, s). 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer x representing the number of test cases and a list y of tuples, each containing an integer n and a string s. It returns a list containing at least one tuple (n, s).**
