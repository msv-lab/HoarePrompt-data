The variable `x` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the value of `x % y`. Here, `x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `y` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, s). The new values of `x` and `y` will be dependent on their initial values.

Since `y` is a list, `x % y` does not make sense as you cannot perform the modulus operation between an integer and a list. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged as there is an error in the operation.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `y` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, s), and the operation cannot be performed due to type mismatch.**
