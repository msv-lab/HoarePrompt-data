According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop is set to iterate from index `i` to the length of `arr`, stepping by `k`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting index `i` must be less than the length of `arr`. 

Given that `vis` has a length of 1 and `put` is the single element in `vis`, we can infer that `vis` was derived from elements in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, it is necessary that `i` is less than `len(arr)`.

Additionally, `j` will start at `i` and will represent the current index in `arr` during the loop's execution.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `vis` is a set of unique elements from `arr` starting from index `i` and incremented by `k`, excluding any elements equal to '?', and the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `put` is the single element in `vis`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is less than `len(arr)` and `j` is equal to `i`.**
