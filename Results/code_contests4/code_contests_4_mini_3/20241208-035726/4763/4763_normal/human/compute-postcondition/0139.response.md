Output State: **`arr` is a list containing tuples where each tuple's first element is the integer `n` and the second element is a string composed of characters '0' and '1', with all '?' characters replaced by either '0' or '1' based on the conditions applied in the loop. If any inconsistency was found during the iterations, the function would have returned False, but since it completes without returning False, all '?' have been resolved appropriately.**
