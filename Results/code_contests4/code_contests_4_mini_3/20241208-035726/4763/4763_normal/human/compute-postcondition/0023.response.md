The function `func_5` accepts parameters related to test cases. The first parameter `t` is a positive integer that represents the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, there are two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the string and must satisfy `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5` with `k` being an even integer; and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `3 ⋅ 10^5`.

The function processes these inputs and produces output based on the conditions of the test cases. However, the specific outputs for different scenarios are not detailed in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, an integer n representing the length of the string for each test case, and a string s consisting of characters '0', '1', and '?'. It processes these inputs according to the defined constraints but the specific outputs are not detailed.**
