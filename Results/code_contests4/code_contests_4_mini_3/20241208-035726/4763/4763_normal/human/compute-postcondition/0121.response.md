According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the relationship between `j`, the length of `arr`, and the increment of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, and `j` is equal to `i + k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than the length of `arr`. 

Since `j` is currently equal to `i + k`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be updated to `j + k` (which would be `i + 2k`). Therefore, the new state must ensure that `j` remains less than the length of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + 2k`.**
