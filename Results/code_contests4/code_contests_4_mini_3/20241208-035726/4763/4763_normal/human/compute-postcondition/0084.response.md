According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. The loop starts at `i` and increments by `k` until it reaches the length of `arr`. 

1. Since `arr` is stated to contain at least one tuple, `len(arr)` is at least 1.
2. The value of `i` is equal to the length of `arr` or the last updated index before the loop terminated. If `i` equals `len(arr)`, the loop will not execute because the starting point is equal to the endpoint.
3. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to a value less than `len(arr)`.
4. The step size `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to progress; otherwise, it could lead to an infinite loop.

Thus, the required adjustments are:
- `i` should be less than `len(arr)`, so set `i` to `len(arr) - 1` or any valid index less than `len(arr)`.
- `k` must be a positive integer.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `vis` is a set containing all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `k` is greater than 0, and `put` is the only element in `vis`.**
