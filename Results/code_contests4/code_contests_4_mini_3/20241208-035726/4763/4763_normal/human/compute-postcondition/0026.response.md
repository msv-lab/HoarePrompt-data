According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `arr`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `i` is also 0, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, so `len(arr)` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by `k`. Therefore, if the loop executes again, `j` will be equal to `0 + k` (which is `k`), and the loop will execute again if `k` is less than the length of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `j` is k, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than k.**
