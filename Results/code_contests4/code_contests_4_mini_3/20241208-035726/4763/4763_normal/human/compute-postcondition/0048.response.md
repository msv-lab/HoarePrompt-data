To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop conditions. 

The loop is defined as follows:
```
for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i`.
- The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`.
- The increment step for `j` is `k`.

### Given State:
- `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, which implies that `len(arr) >= 1`.
- `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, meaning the current value of `i` is `i + 1`.
  
### Conditions for Execution:
For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be satisfied:
1. `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. Since `i` is currently `i + 1`, it means that `i + 1` must be less than `len(arr)`. Hence, we need to ensure that `len(arr) > i + 1`.
2. `j` must start at `i`, which is fine since `j` will take the value of `i`.
3. The loop will need to increment `j` by `k`. Therefore, `k` must be a positive integer to ensure progression through the list.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we must confirm the following:
- `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is the adjusted value of `i`).
- `j` will start at `i`, and for the loop to run at least once, `i` should be less than `len(arr)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state can be expressed as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute `len(arr) > i + 1`, `j` is initialized to `i`, and `k` is a positive integer.**
