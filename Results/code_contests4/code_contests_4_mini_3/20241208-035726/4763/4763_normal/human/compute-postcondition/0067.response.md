The variable `vis` is assigned an empty set. The previous state of other variables (`arr` and `i`) is unaffected by this assignment. Thus, the Output State is: `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than the length of `arr`, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is '?' and `vis` is an empty set.
