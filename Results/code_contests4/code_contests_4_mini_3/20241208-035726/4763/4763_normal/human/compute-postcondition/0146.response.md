The value of `dic[arr[i]]` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is 2, we access `arr[2]` to get the corresponding key in `dic`. The exact value of `dic[arr[2]]` before the increment is unknown, but it will be increased by 1. Other variables such as `arr`, `dic`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is updated with one of its keys incremented by 1, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is updated with one of its keys incremented by 1, `i` is 2**
