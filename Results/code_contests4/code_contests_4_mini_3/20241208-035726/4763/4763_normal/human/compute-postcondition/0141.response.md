According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1. The state of `arr` and `dic` does not directly impact the ability of the loop to execute, but they are relevant for the loop body that follows. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` needs to be greater than 0, and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
