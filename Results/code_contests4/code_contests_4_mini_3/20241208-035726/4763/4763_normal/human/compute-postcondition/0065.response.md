Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, and for all indices `j` where `j` is in the range from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k`, if `arr[j]` was a question mark ('?'), it has been replaced with the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` was not a question mark and was not equal to `arr[i]`, the function would have returned False, but since this condition was not met, the program continues without returning any value.**
