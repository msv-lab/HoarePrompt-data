According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is updated with one of its keys incremented by 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 2**
