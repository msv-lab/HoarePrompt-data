According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `len(arr)`. The loop starts from `j = i` and increments `j` by `k` on each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + k`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`.

Since `j` is currently `i + k`, for the loop to execute a second time, `len(arr)` must be greater than `j`, which means `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`.

Thus, before the next iteration, the values need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` should be updated to `i + 2k` for the next iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `j` is `i + 2k`, for the loop to execute again `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`.**
