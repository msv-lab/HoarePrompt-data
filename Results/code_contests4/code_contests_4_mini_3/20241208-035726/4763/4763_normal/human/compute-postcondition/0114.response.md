According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `arr`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i`, which is equal to the length of `arr`. This means that for the loop to execute for the first time, `j` must be less than the length of `arr`. 

Since `i` is currently equal to the length of `arr`, the loop will not execute. Additionally, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than the length of `arr`, which it is not in the current state.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `i` to be less than the length of `arr` (for example, `i` could be `len(arr) - 1`), and `j` should be initialized to that adjusted value. 

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is adjusted to be less than the length of `arr` (for example, `i` could be `len(arr) - 1`), `j` is initialized to `i`, `vis` is an empty set**
