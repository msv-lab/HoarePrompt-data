Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `args`, and `at_start` is False. If `at_start` is False, the file writes the string representation of `x` to it.***
