The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. The parameter `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, where `k` is even) and a string `s` (with length `n` composed of characters '0', '1', and '?'). The parameter `k` is an even integer. 

After executing the function body, the function can return multiple values based on different cases:
- In most cases (Case_1 to Case_13), the function returns `False` due to various conditions not being met.
- In Case_14, the function returns `True`, indicating that certain conditions involving counts of '1', '0', and '?' in a dictionary are satisfied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of tuples `arr` and an even integer `k`, and it returns `False` for several conditions while returning `True` when specific count conditions are satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `arr` and an even integer `k`, returning `False` for most cases unless specific conditions are met, in which case it returns `True`.**
