Output State: **`arr` is a list containing tuples, where all indices from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k` have been assigned the value of `put`; `vis` is a set with a single unique element `put`; `put` is the single element in `vis`; `i` is less than `len(arr)`; `j` is equal to `len(arr)` if `i` was the last index modified, and `j` is computed as `i + nk` where `n` is the total number of loop iterations executed.**
