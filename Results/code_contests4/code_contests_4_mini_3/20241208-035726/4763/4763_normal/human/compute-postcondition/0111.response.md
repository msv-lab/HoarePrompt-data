Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. Each element in `arr` that was initially equal to '?' has been replaced by the value of `arr[i]`, and if an element in `arr` was neither equal to `arr[i]` nor equal to '?', the function would return False before completing. If the loop completes without returning False, all elements that were '?' have been updated to `arr[i]`, and no elements in `arr` are different from `arr[i]` unless they were already different from '?' and `arr[i]`.**
