Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `args` is an iterable containing the elements, `file` has written the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False; `file` has written `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file, and the flush operation is enabled because `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is true.***
