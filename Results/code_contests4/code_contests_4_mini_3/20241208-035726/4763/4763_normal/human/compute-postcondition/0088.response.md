According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and the length of `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, which means the loop has not yet reached the end of the list. The variable `k` is greater than 0, indicating that `j` is incremented by `k` in each iteration. 

Given that `j` is `i + k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `len(arr)`. Since `j` is currently assigned the value of `i + k`, it will be increased by `k` again in the next iteration.

To summarize:
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `j` will be updated to `j + k` for the next iteration.

If `j` is currently `i + k`, the next value of `j` will be `j + k`, which means the loop can execute again as long as `i + 2k` is still less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `vis` is a set containing all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `k` is greater than 0, `put` is the only element in `vis`, `j` is `i + 2k`, and for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**
