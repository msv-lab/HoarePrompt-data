Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is updated with the counts of '1', '0', and '?', `i` is equal to `k - 1` if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `i` is -1. The count of '1' in `dic` is not equal to the count of '0', and the count of '?' in `dic` is not equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '1' and '0'.***
