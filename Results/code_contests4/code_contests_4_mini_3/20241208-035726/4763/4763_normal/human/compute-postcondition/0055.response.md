According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `arr`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i` (the starting index), and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by `k`. 

Since `arr` contains at least one tuple, and `j` starts at `i`, the next value of `j` will be `j + k`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `j + k` is still less than `len(arr)`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `j` is `i + k`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`.**
