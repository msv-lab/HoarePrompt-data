According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop iterates starting from `i` and continues until it reaches `len(arr)` with a step of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, meaning the loop was able to execute at least once. 

Given that `j` starts at `i` and increments by `k` for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated. If we denote the current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration, it would be `j = i + m*k` for some integer `m`, where `j` is still less than `len(arr)`.

Thus, after the last iteration, `j` would be incremented by `k`, making `j = i + (m + 1)*k`. For the loop to execute again, it must hold that `j` is still less than `len(arr)`.

Since `i` is less than `len(arr)`, and `k` is greater than 0, we can conclude that `j` will be `i + k` for the next iteration, and the condition of `j < len(arr)` must still be satisfied.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `vis` is a set containing all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `k` is greater than 0, and `put` is the only element in `vis`; `j` is `i + k`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**
