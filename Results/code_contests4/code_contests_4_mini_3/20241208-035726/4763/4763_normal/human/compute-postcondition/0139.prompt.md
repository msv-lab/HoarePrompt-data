You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the for loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the for loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i
```
Output state after the loop executes 1 times:  `factorial` is `1`, 'i' is 1 , n is at least 1.
Output state after the loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is 2, 'i' is 2 , n is at least 2.
Output state after the loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is 6 , 'i' is 3 , n is at least 3.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
If n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and i will be n. If n is 0  then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 which is indeed the factorial for 0.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
Output State: **``n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is the factorial of 'n'**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0,'students_num' is 0, students is a list of students.
Code of the loop:
```
for student in students:
    total += student
    students_num += 1
```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `total` is equal to the first student, 'students_num' is 1, students is a list with at least one student, student is the first student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student, 'students_num' is 2, students is a list with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student plus the third student, 'students_num' is 3, students is a list with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list.


Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of a list students and stores it in total and the number of students in students_num. The loop will be executed at least once if students is a list with at least one student. If the list is empty the loop does not execute and total and students_num are 0.
Output State: **total is equal to the sum of all students, students_num is the number of students, students is a list of students.**

Your Task:

Initial State: arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, with k being even) and a string s (|s| = n) composed of characters '0', '1', and '?' such that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5. k is an even integer.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] != '?':
        for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
            if arr[j] != arr[i] and arr[j] != '?':
                return False
            if arr[j] == '?':
                arr[j] = arr[i]
    else:
        vis = set([])
        for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
            if arr[j] != '?':
                vis.add(arr[j])
        if len(vis) == 2:
            return False
        if len(vis) == 1:
            put = list(vis)[0]
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                arr[j] = put

```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then for every index `j` from `i` to the length of `arr` with a step of `k`, the elements are either equal to `arr[i]` or are not different from `arr[i]`, and `arr` remains unchanged if the loop does not execute. If `arr[i]` is equal to '?' and `len(vis) == 1`, then `arr` contains `put` at every `k`-th index starting from `i`, while all other elements of `arr` remain unchanged. If `len(vis)` is not equal to 1, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[i]` is not a question mark, for all indices `j` from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k`, any question marks have been replaced with the value of `arr[i]`. If any element in this range was not a question mark and did not equal `arr[i]`, the function would have returned False, but since this did not occur, the program continues. If `arr[i]` is a question mark, then `vis` is a set containing all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `i` is equal to the length of `arr` or the last updated index before the loop terminated, and if the length of `vis` is 1, every `k`-th index starting from `i` in `arr` is set to `put`, `vis` contains only `put`, and `i` remains less than `len(arr)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', all elements that were initially equal to '?' have been replaced by the value of `arr[i]`, and if any element in `arr` was neither equal to `arr[i]` nor equal to '?', the function would return False before completing. If the loop completes without returning False, no elements in `arr` are different from `arr[i]` unless they were already different from '?' and `arr[i]`. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is a set with a single unique element `put`, and all indices from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k` have been assigned the value of `put`. If `i` was the last index modified, `j` is equal to `len(arr)`; otherwise, `j` is computed as `i + nk`, where `n` is the total number of loop iterations executed.


Now, please think step by step. Use the results from the output states for the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example to help you , but mostly focus on the loop code to determine the loop's output state after ALL THE ITERATIONS OF THE LOOP HAVE FINISHED. Try to understand what  will be the values of the variables after it executes. In the case the loop doesnot execute, what will be the values of the variables.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
