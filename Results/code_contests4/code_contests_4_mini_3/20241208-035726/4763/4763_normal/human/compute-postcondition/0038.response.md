According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. 

1. `i` is initialized to 0, which is a valid starting index.
2. The length of `arr` is at least 1 since `arr` contains at least one tuple. Therefore, `len(arr)` is greater than 0.
3. The step value `k` must be greater than 0; otherwise, the loop could result in an infinite loop or not execute at all.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that:
- `k` is greater than 0 to avoid an infinite loop.
- `j` will start from `i`, which is 0.

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop executes is as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `vis` contains all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `put` is the single value contained in `vis`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0**
