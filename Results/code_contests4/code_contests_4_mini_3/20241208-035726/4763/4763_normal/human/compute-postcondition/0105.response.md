Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the function returns False. If neither condition is met, there is no return value.***
