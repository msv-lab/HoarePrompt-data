Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then for every index `j` from `i` to the length of `arr` with a step of `k`, the elements are either equal to `arr[i]` or are not different from `arr[i]`, and `arr` remains unchanged if the loop does not execute. If `arr[i]` is equal to '?' and `len(vis) == 1`, then `arr` contains `put` at every `k`-th index starting from `i`, while all other elements of `arr` remain unchanged. If `len(vis)` is not equal to 1, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.***
