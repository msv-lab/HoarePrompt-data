According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. Since `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, the initial value of `j` will be equal to `len(arr)`, meaning the loop will not execute even for the first time, as `j` will not be less than `len(arr)`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`, which indicates that `i` should be adjusted to be less than the length of `arr`. Additionally, since `j` starts at `i`, it will also need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, `j` is equal to `i`, and for the loop to execute the first time `i` must be less than the length of `arr`.**
