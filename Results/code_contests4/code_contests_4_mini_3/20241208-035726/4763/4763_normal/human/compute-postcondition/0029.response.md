According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and the length of `arr`. The loop starts at index `i` and increments `j` by `k` each time until `j` is no longer less than `len(arr)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is `k`, and `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. 

Given that `j` is currently `k`, we need to ensure that `k` is less than `len(arr)`. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `k`, so it will become `j + k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(arr)` must be greater than `j + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `j` is k, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than k + k.**
