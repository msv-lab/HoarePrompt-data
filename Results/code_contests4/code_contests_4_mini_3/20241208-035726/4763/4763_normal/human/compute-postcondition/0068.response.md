According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`, the length of `arr`, and the value of `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `arr`, which is ensured by the condition given. Additionally, since the loop starts at `i` and increments by `k`, `j` will take on the value of `i` during the first iteration of the loop. 

As per the initial state, `arr` contains at least one tuple, `vis` is an empty set, and it is specified that the element at index `i` of `arr` is '?'. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `j` will be equal to `i` (the starting index for the loop), and `i` must still satisfy the condition of being less than the length of `arr`. 

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, `j` is `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than the length of `arr`, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is '?', `vis` is an empty set**.
