According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `arr` or the last updated index before the loop terminated. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than `len(arr)`. Since `i` is currently at `len(arr)`, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than the length of `arr`.**
