According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `len(arr)`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and the loop starts with `j` initialized to `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by `k` in the next iteration.

Thus, if `j` is 0, to determine the next value of `j` after this iteration, we need to add `k` to `j`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` becomes `0 + k`, which is `k`. 

We also need to ensure that `k` is less than `len(arr)`, as the loop condition requires `j` to remain less than `len(arr)` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, where `put` is the single value contained in `vis`, `j` is `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `k`.**
