Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If the element at index `j` of `arr` is not '?', then `vis` is updated to include the element at index `j` of `arr`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` for the next iteration. If the element at index `j` is '?', the else part does not exist, and the loop continues with the next iteration.***
