Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `vis` is a set containing all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', and `i` is equal to the length of `arr` or the last updated index before the loop terminated. If the length of `vis` is 1, then every `k`-th index starting from `i` in `arr` is set to `put`, `vis` contains only `put`, and `i` remains less than `len(arr)`, where `k` is greater than 0.***
