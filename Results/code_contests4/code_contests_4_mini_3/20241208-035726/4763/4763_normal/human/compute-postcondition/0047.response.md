According to the code, the loop will execute for every index `i` from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`. The current state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, and since the loop is iterating over the range of the length of `arr`, we need to determine what adjustments are necessary for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` must be less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is currently at the last index of `arr`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1, making it `i + 1`. 

If `i` is the last valid index (which would be `len(arr) - 1`), the loop cannot execute again. However, if `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, the next iteration will execute with the new index.

So, if `i` is currently less than `len(arr) - 1`, we can safely increment `i` by 1. 

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `arr`**.
