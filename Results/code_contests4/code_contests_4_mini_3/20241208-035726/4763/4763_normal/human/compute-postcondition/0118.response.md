According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and the length of `arr`. The loop starts at `i`, increments `j` by `k` on each iteration, and continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, which is less than the length of `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by `k`, so `j` will become `i + k`. The loop will continue executing if `j` (which is now `i + k`) is still less than the length of `arr`.

Therefore, to summarize the state changes:
- `j` will be updated to `i + k`.
- Given that `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, it is implied that there is at least one iteration possible, but for the next iteration, we need `j` to be less than the length of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the length of `arr`.**
