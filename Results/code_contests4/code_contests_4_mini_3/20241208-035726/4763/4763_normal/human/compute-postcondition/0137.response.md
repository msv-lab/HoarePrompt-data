Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing tuples, `vis` is a set with a single unique element `put`, and `put` is the only element in `vis`. All indices from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k` have been assigned the value of `put`. If `i` was the last index modified, `j` is equal to `len(arr)`; otherwise, `j` is computed as `i + nk`, where `n` is the total number of loop iterations executed.***
