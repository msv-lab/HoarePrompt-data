According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and the length of `arr`. The loop starts iterating from `i` and increments `j` by `k` on each iteration until it reaches the length of `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + k * m` for some integer `m` (where `m` is the number of completed iterations). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. 

Since `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, and `j` starts from `i` and increments by `k`, we need to ensure that for the next iteration, `j` is updated to `j + k`. 

Thus, the new value of `j` will be `i + k * (m + 1)`, and the loop can execute again as long as `j` remains less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `j` is equal to `i + k * m`, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**.
