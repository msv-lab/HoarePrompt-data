According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and the length of `arr`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` starts at `i` and is incremented by `k` in each iteration. Since `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, the loop can execute again if the next value of `j` (which will be `j + k`) is still within the bounds of the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j + k` must be less than the length of `arr`. Therefore, `j` will be updated to `j + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `j` is updated to `j + k`, for the loop to execute again `j + k` must be less than the length of `arr`**
