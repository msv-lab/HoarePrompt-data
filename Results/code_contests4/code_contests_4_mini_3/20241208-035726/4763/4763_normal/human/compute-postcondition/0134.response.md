According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop will execute again if `j` (which is equal to `i + k`) is still less than `len(arr)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, and `j` is equal to `i + k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`, which means `i + k` must be less than `len(arr)`.

Since `j` is `i + k`, after this iteration, `i` will remain unchanged and `j` will need to be updated to `i + 2k` for the next iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple; `vis` is a set with a single unique element `put`; `put` is the single element in `vis`; `i` is less than `len(arr)`; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `len(arr)` (i.e., `i + k < len(arr)`), and `j` will be `i + 2k`.**
