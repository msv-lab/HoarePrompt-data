Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`, making `arr[j]` equal to `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?' and not equal to `arr[i]`, the function returns False, otherwise, execution continues without returning any value.***
