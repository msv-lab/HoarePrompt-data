The loop iterates over the list `arr` starting from index `i`, incrementing by `k` each time, and adds elements to the set `vis` if they are not equal to '?'. Since `i` is initially less than the length of `arr`, the loop will execute as long as the index `j` remains within the bounds of the list.

If the loop executes completely, `vis` will contain all unique elements from `arr` at indices starting from `i` and incremented by `k`, excluding any elements that are equal to '?'. 

If the loop does not execute, it means that `i` is equal to or greater than the length of `arr`, in which case `vis` remains an empty set.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `vis` is a set of unique elements from `arr` starting from index `i` and incremented by `k`, excluding any elements equal to '?'**.
