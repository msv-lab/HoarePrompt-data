Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', all elements that were initially equal to '?' have been replaced by the value of `arr[i]`, and if any element in `arr` was neither equal to `arr[i]` nor equal to '?', the function would return False before completing. If the loop completes without returning False, no elements in `arr` are different from `arr[i]` unless they were already different from '?' and `arr[i]`. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is a set with a single unique element `put`, and all indices from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k` have been assigned the value of `put`. If `i` was the last index modified, `j` is equal to `len(arr)`; otherwise, `j` is computed as `i + nk`, where `n` is the total number of loop iterations executed.***
