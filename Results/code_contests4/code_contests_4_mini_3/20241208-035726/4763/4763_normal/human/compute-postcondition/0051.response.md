Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute `len(arr) > i + 1`, `j` is initialized to `i`, and `k` is a positive integer. The element at index `j` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `i` of `arr`, or the element at index `j` of `arr` is a question mark ('?').***
