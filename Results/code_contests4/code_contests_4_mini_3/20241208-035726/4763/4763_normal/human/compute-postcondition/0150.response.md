Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is updated with the counts of '1', '0', and '?', `i` is equal to `k - 1` if `k` is greater than 0; if `k` is 0, `dic` remains unchanged and `i` is -1. The counts of '1' and '0' in `dic` are equal, or the count of '?' in `dic` is equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '1' and '0'.***
