According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of the array `arr`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, which is less than `len(arr)`. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `k`, making the new value of `j` equal to `i + k`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(arr)` and `j` must be less than `len(arr)` after the increment. Therefore, `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `vis` is a set with a single unique element `put`, `put` is the single element in `vis`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`**
