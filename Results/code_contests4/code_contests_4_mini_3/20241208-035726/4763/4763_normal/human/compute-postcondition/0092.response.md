Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `arr[i]` is not a question mark, for all indices `j` from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k`, any question marks have been replaced with the value of `arr[i]`. If any element in this range was not a question mark and did not equal `arr[i]`, the function would have returned False, but since this did not occur, the program continues. If `arr[i]` is a question mark, then `vis` is a set containing all elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `i` is equal to the length of `arr` or the last updated index before the loop terminated, and if the length of `vis` is 1, every `k`-th index starting from `i` in `arr` is set to `put`, `vis` contains only `put`, and `i` remains less than `len(arr)`.***
