To determine the output state, we analyze the code snippet and the initial state:

- The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is a dictionary initialized as `{'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `k` is greater than 0 while `i` is 0.
- The line of code `dic[arr[i]] += 1` indicates that we are accessing the first element of `arr` (since `i` is 0) and using it as a key to increment the corresponding value in the dictionary `dic`.

Now, since `arr` is a list of tuples, we need to assume that the first element `arr[0]` is a tuple with a first element that matches one of the keys in `dic` (i.e., '1', '0', or '?'). The specific value of `arr[0]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific key that will be incremented, but we can state that one of the counts in `dic` will increase by 1.

Therefore, we conclude that:
- One of the keys in `dic` (`'1'`, `'0'`, or `'?'`) will be incremented by 1 based on the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing tuples, `dic` is updated with one of its keys incremented by 1, `i` is 0**.
