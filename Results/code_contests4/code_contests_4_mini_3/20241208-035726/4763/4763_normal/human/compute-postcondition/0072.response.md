According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop starts at index `i` and increments `j` by `k` for each iteration, continuing until `j` is no longer less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, and `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. Since `j` starts at `i` and increments by `k`, we need to ensure that `i + k` is still less than `len(arr)`. Therefore, `j` will be equal to `i` for the next iteration, and `i` will be incremented again.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)` and will be equal to `i` for the next iteration.**
