Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list containing at least one tuple. If the element at index `j` is equal to '?', then the element at index `j` is updated to be equal to the element at index `i`, which is the same as the previous value at index `i`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `arr`.***
