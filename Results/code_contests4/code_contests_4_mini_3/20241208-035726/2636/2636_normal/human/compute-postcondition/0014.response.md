The code creates a list called `cards` that includes integers from 1 to 10, excluding any integers that are present in the list `c`. The values of `C1`, `C2`, and `c1c2` do not directly affect the creation of `cards`, but the content of `c` will determine which integers are excluded from `cards`. 

Thus, if `c` contains some integers between 1 and 10, those integers will not be included in `cards`. The remaining integers will be those that were not in `c`, and their count will depend on the specific values in `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `c1c2` is between 2 and 20, and `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding those in `c`.

Output State: **`C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `c1c2` is between 2 and 20, and `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding those in `c`.**
