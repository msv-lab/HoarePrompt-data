The code creates a list `cards` that includes integers from 1 to 10, excluding any integers that are present in the list `c`. The values of `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are not directly affected, but they may influence the contents of `c`. Since `c` contains integers parsed from the input, the resulting `cards` list will depend on which integers are present in `c`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the range of possible integers for `cards` based on the contents of `c`.

Output State: **`C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `C3` is between 1 and 10; `cards` is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 not in `c`.**
