Functionality: ** The function reads multiple lines of input where each line contains three integers representing card values. It calculates the sum of the first two integers (C1 and C2), then counts how many integers from the range 1 to 10, excluding C1 and C2, can be added to this sum without exceeding 20. If at least one line results in more than 3 valid integers, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept parameters directly, and the values for C1, C2, and the third card (C3) are taken from the input. **
