Output State: **`C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10; `c1c2` is between 2 and 20; `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding `C1` and `C2`; `e` is the total count of integers in `cards` for which `i + c1c2 <= 20`. The output will be 'YES' if `e` is greater than 3 for at least one iteration, otherwise 'NO'.**
