The function `func` accepts three parameters: `C1`, `C2`, and `C3`. All three parameters are integers that must be within the range of 1 to 10 inclusive, representing the numbers on your two cards (`C1` and `C2`) and your opponent's front card (`C3`). 

Since the output details are not provided, we cannot specify the return values based on the conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integer parameters (`C1`, `C2`, and `C3`) within the defined range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters C1, C2, and C3, all between 1 and 10 inclusive.**
