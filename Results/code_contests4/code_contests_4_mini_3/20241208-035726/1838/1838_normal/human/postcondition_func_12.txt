The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `r` where each tuple contains three integers representing the lengths of fence segments. However, it attempts to calculate a combinatorial value using `factorial` with `r`, which is incorrect as `r` is a list of tuples and cannot be directly used in this context. As a result, the function will raise an error instead of returning a valid output.
