The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of results from the function `func_3()`, indicating whether given lengths (provided through a separate context) can form a triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem. The function does not handle or validate the input values directly, relying on `func_3()` to process the lengths of the three fence segments.
