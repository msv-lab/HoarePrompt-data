The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three integers, and returns the list sorted in descending order based on the key function `getKey`. There are no checks for the integrity of the input list or the tuples, so if `l` is empty or contains invalid data, the function will still execute but may not behave as intended.
