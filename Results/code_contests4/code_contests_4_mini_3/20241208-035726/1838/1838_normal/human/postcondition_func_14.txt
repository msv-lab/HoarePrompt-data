The function accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, and computes `x` raised to the power of `y`, modulo `p`, using an efficient method called exponentiation by squaring. The return value is the result of `x^y % p`. This function handles the case where `y` is 0 by returning 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. It also correctly modifies `x` using `p` to ensure all calculations remain within the bounds of modular arithmetic.
