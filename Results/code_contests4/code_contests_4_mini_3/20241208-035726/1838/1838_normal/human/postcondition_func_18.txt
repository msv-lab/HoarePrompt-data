The function accepts no parameters directly but operates within a loop that iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_1()`. For each iteration, it retrieves three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from `func_3()`. It then calls `func_20(c + 1)` for each iteration, effectively executing this call a number of times equal to the result from `func_1()`. The function does not return any values and its behavior is dependent on the implementations of `func_1()`, `func_3()`, and `func_20()`.
