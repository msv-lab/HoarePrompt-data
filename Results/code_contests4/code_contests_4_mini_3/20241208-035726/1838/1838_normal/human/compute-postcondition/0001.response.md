The code snippet provided is used to pop values from the `kwargs` dictionary with default values for `sep` and `file`. However, it does not modify or affect the states of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The output is primarily related to how the values will be set or used in the future but does not change any current variable states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000); `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9); `sep` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`**
