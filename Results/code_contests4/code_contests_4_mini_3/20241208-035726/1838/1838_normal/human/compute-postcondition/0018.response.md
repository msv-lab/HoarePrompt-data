The value of `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`, but it was already `False`. Therefore, the value of `at_start` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. The Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, `sep` is written to the file, and `x` is written to the file as a string.
