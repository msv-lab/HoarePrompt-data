The function `func_20` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it considers three additional parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are also positive integers representing the lengths of three fence segments. After executing the function, it evaluates the input values and determines if these segments can form a triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem. If the segments can form a triangle, the function returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO". 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (number of test cases) and for each test case accepts three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (lengths of fence segments). It returns "YES" if the segments can form a triangle, otherwise it returns "NO".**
