The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `sep`, and `file`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000); `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9); `sep` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is set to the value from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True.
