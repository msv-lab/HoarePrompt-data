The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of test cases. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is even or divisible by 3. If `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3, it returns True. For values of `n` greater than 3, it checks for primality by testing divisibility against integers of the form 6k Â± 1 and returns True if `n` is prime, or False if it is not. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
