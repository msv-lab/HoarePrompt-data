The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents a digit of `n`. The function does not validate whether `n` is within the stated bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), nor does it handle cases where `n` could be outside this range or negative, as it only processes the digits of `n` as they are.
