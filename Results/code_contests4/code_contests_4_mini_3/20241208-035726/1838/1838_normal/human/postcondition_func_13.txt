The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing fence segment lengths. It returns the result of integer division of `x` by the length of `y`. If `x` is not divisible by the length of `y`, it returns this integer division plus 1. Note that the code contains an error as it performs the modulus operation on `x` and `y`, which may lead to incorrect behavior since `y` should be the length of the list rather than used directly in the modulus operation.
