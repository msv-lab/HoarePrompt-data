The function accepts input values for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but it only returns the input value for `t` as a positive integer. It does not handle or return the values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are expected to be provided alongside `t`. Therefore, the function cannot be relied upon to return all four integers as stated in the annotations.
