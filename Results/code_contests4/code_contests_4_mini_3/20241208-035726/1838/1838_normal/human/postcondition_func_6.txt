The function accepts a list of test cases called `item`, where each test case is expected to contain three integers. It returns the second test case from the list, which is the second element of the list `item`, regardless of the content of the test case. If the list does not contain at least two elements, this may result in an IndexError, as the code does not handle cases where the input list has fewer than two elements.
