The function does not directly accept any parameters and is designed to process multiple test cases involving three positive integers (a, b, and c) for each test case by reading from an input file 'input.txt' and writing results to an output file 'output.txt'. However, the actual processing logic for handling the test cases is not included in the provided code, which leaves the functionality incomplete. Therefore, it does not perform any computations or return any values as it stands.
