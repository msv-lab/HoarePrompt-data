The function accepts no parameters and reads a single line of input, which is expected to contain three integers a, b, and c. It returns a map object containing these integers, which are guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^9. However, since the function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or does not contain exactly three integers, it may raise an error if the input does not meet these expectations.
