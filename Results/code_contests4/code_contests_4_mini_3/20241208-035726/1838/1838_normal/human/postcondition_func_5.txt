The function `func_6` initializes a new thread to run the `main` function, but it does not directly handle any test cases or evaluate if three lengths can form a triangle. The actual logic for processing the test cases and checking the triangle condition is expected to be in the `main` function, which is not provided here. Therefore, `func_6` does not directly return "YES" or "NO" for the test cases as described in the annotations; it merely sets up the environment for running another function.
