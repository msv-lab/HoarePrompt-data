The function does not directly accept parameters regarding the lengths of the fence segments. Instead, it prints the provided arguments to a specified output stream, with an optional separator and end character. However, it does not perform any checks to determine if the segments can form a triangle, nor does it return "YES" or "NO" based on any conditions related to triangle formation. Therefore, it simply outputs the given values to the specified file or standard output, and does not fulfill the described annotation regarding triangle validation.
