To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to break down the components involved and determine the impact of the code based on the initial state.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5.
   - `i` is 4, indicating the total number of lines of input processed.
   - `c` is an array where `c[n]` represents the count of occurrences of the digit `n` (for n in range 0 to 4). Any index corresponding to digits that were not present in the input remains at 0.

2. **Code to Analyze**:
   ```
   print['NO', 'YES'][max(c) <= n * 2]
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression `max(c)` retrieves the maximum count of occurrences from the array `c`.
   - The condition `max(c) <= n * 2` evaluates whether the maximum count is less than or equal to `n * 2`. 
   - The result of this condition will be either `True` (if the condition is satisfied) or `False` (if it is not).
   - The output will be `'YES'` if the condition is `True` and `'NO'` if it is `False` due to the indexing of the list `['NO', 'YES']`.

4. **Output State**:
   Since `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we need to express the output state based on the information given.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5; `i` is 4; `c` is an array with counts of occurrences; the output is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the condition `max(c) <= n * 2`.**
