According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided to `raw_input()`. The loop iterates over the elements in the list created from the input. Since `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, we can deduce that the input must yield at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Since `i` is already set to 0, we need to ensure that the input produces a non-empty list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, the input must contain at least one element.

State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input from raw_input() must produce a list with at least 1 element**
