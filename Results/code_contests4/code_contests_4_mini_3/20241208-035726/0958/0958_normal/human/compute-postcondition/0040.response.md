The function `func` accepts a parameter `k`, which is an integer constrained such that \(1 \leq k \leq 5\). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `panel`, which is a list of strings where each string consists of 4 characters that are either digits from '1' to '9' or the character '.'. After executing the function body, it processes the panel according to the value of `k` and determines which panels need to be pressed based on the conditions defined in the function. The function returns a specific output based on the processed information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 5) and a 4x4 panel represented as a list of strings, returning results based on the processing of the panel according to the value of `k`.**
