Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `i` is the total number of iterations of the loop, and `c` is an array where each index corresponds to the count of occurrences of the digits 0 to 4 in the input, with any index corresponding to digits that were not present in the input remaining at its initial value (which is 0).**
