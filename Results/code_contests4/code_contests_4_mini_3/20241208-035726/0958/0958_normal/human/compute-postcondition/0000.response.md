The value of `n` is assigned the value from `input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 5 and the panel table consists of strings of digits or the character '.', the input will not affect the values of `k` or the panel table. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5; the panel table is a list of strings; `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5; the panel table is a list of strings; `n` is an input string.**
