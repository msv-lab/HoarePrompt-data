The variable `c[int(j)]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is the sixth character of the input string, which is an integer in the range of 0 to 9 (assuming it represents a digit). Therefore, `c[int(j)]` will be increased by 1 based on the current value of `c[int(j)]`. The values of `k` and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `i` is 5; `c[int(j)]` is increased by 1.**
