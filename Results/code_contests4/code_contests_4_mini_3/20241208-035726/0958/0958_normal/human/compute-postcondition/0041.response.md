Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5) and reads a 4x4 grid of characters from input, where each character is either a digit from '1' to '9' or a '.' (indicating no pressing needed). It counts the occurrences of each digit and checks if the maximum count of any digit is less than or equal to `n * 2`. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is not within the specified bounds, nor does it validate the input format. **
