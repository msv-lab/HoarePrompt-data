#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, and the 4x4 panel table is a list of strings where each string consists of 4 characters that are either digits from '1' to '9' or the character '.', representing the panels that need to be pressed or are not required to be pressed.
def func():
    n = input()
    c = [0] * 10
    for i in range(4):
        for j in list(raw_input()):
            if j != '.':
                c[int(j)] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `i` is 4 (the total number of lines of input processed), and `c` is an array where `c[n]` is the count of occurrences of the digit `n` (for n in range 0 to 4) in the combined input strings, with any index corresponding to digits that were not present in the input remaining at its initial value (which is 0).
    print['NO', 'YES'][max(c) <= n * 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5) and reads a 4x4 grid of characters from input, where each character is either a digit from '1' to '9' or a '.' (indicating no pressing needed). It counts the occurrences of each digit and checks if the maximum count of any digit is less than or equal to `n * 2`. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is not within the specified bounds, nor does it validate the input format.
