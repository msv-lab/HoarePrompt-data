Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the health and explosion damage of monsters. It calculates the minimum number of shots required to defeat the monsters based on their health and the damage they can inflict. The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result is the total accumulated shots required plus the minimum health that can be sustained after the last monster. Edge cases include scenarios where no damage is inflicted or all monsters have health that can be negated by previous monsters' damage. **
