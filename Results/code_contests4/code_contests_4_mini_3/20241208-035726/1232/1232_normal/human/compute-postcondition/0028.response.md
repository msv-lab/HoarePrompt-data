Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, then `T` remains greater than 0, `_i` is 4, `N` is greater than 4, `monsters` contains the previous elements plus the `cur` map object, `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`, `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`, and `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[N - 1][1])` if `N` is greater than 0.***
