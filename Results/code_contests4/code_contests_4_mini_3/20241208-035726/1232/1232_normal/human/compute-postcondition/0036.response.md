Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `T` remains greater than 0; `_i` is 5; `N` is greater than 5 for the loop to execute a second time; `monsters` contains the previous elements plus the `cur` map object; `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`; `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])` if `N` is greater than 0; `cur` is a map object created from `inp[4].split()` converted to integers; `monsters` now includes `cur`.***
