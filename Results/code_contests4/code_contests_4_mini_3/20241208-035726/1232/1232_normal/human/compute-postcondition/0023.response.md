Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `N` must be greater than 4, `monsters` contains the `cur` map object, `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`, `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`, and `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[N - 1][1]) if N` is greater than 0; `cur` is now a map object of integers derived from `inp[4].split()`.**
