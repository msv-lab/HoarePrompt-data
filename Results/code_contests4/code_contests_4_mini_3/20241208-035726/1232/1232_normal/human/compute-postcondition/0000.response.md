Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 150000) representing the number of test cases; each test case contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000), followed by `n` pairs of integers (`a_i`, `b_i`) (1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ 10^12) representing the health and explosion damage of each monster; the total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000; `stdin` is initialized to read input data.**
