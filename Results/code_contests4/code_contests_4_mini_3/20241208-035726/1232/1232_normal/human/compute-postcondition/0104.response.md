The `monsters` list is updated to include the current value of `cur`. The previous state indicates that `cur` contains mapped integers from `inp[_i]`, and since `_i` has been increased by 1, the specific value of `cur` is now appended to `monsters`. The other variables (`_i`, `start`, `mnShots`, `N`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_i` has been increased by 1; `start` is the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `mnShots` is updated accordingly; `N` is greater than 1; `n` is 2; `cur` now contains the mapped integers from `inp[_i]`; `monsters` includes the previous values plus the current value of `cur`.**
