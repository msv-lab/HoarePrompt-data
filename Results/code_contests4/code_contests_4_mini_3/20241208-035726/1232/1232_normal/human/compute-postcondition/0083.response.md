The variable `start` is assigned the value `maxint`. This does not affect the previous values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is increased by 1, `start` is assigned the value `maxint`, `res` contains an appended value of `mnShots + start`; `monsters` is an empty list; `mnShots` is 0.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is assigned the value `maxint`, `res` contains an appended value of mnShots + start; `monsters` is an empty list; `mnShots` is 0**.
