The `monsters` list is modified by appending the `cur` map object to it. Since `cur` is a map object of integers from `inp[2]`, the `monsters` list will now contain this map object. The other variables `_i`, `N`, `mnShots`, `start`, and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 3, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` contains the `cur` map object, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 3, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` contains the `cur` map object, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`**
