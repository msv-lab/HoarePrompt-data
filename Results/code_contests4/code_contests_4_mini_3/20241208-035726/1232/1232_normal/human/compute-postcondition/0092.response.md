Postcondition: ***`_i` has been increased by 1, `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`, where `dam` is calculated as the maximum between 0 and `cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`. The value of `mnShots` is increased by `dam`. If `n` is greater than 0, the values of `res` contain the appended value of `mnShots + start`, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is updated accordingly, and `n` remains 0.***
