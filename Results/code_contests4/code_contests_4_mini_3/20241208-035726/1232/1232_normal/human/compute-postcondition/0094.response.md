The `cur` variable is assigned the result of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, which means that it will take the input from `inp` at the index `_i`, split that input string into separate components, and convert each component to an integer. The previous values of `_i`, `start`, `mnShots`, `N`, and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment. However, we know that `_i` has been increased by 1, and `n` is 1. The value of `cur` will depend on the contents of the `inp` list at the updated `_i` index. 

Since the specific input at `inp[_i]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact integers that `cur` will contain. Therefore, the output state must reflect the changes without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`_i` has been increased by 1; `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `mnShots` is updated accordingly; `N` must be greater than 1; `n` is 1; `cur` is assigned the result of mapping integers from `inp[_i]`.**
