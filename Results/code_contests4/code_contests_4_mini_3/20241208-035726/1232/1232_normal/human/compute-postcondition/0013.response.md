The value of `cur` is assigned the result of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, which converts the split parts of the string located at index `_i` in the list `inp` to integers. The previous state does not affect `cur`, but it is dependent on the contents of `inp[_i]`. Since `_i` is 2, `cur` will hold a map object of integers derived from the string at `inp[2]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 2, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, and `cur` is a map object of integers from `inp[2]`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 2, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, and `cur` is a map object of integers from `inp[2]**.
