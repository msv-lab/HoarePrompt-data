The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_i` is `5 + N`. Since `N` is greater than 0, the specific value of `_i` is at least 6. Therefore, `_i` will be at least 7 after the increment. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is at least 7, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `cur` is a map object of integers from `inp[_i].split()`**
