Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `T` remains greater than 0; `_i` is 4; for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 5; `monsters` contains the previous elements plus the `cur` map object; `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`; `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[N - 1][1])` if `N` is greater than 0; `cur` is a map object created from `inp[_i].split()` converted to integers.**
