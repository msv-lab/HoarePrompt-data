Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 4, `N` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute a fourth time, `monsters` now contains the previous elements plus the `cur` map object, `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`, `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`, and `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[N - 1][1]) if N` is greater than 0; `cur` is a map object of integers derived from `inp[4].split()`.**
