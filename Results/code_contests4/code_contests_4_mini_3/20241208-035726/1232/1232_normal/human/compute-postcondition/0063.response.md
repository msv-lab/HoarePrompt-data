Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is at least 8, `monsters` is a list containing integers, `dam` is max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]), `start` is either `start` or cur[0] - dam, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 8, `cur` is a map object containing integers from the split input at index `_i` of `inp`; `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, and `start` is updated to min(start, cur[0] - dam).**
