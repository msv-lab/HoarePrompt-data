According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0, indicating that there are still iterations left to execute. Since `_i` is equal to `3 + N`, and `N` is greater than 0, the next value of `_i` will be incremented by 1, making `_i` equal to `4 + N` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be decremented by 1, meaning it will be `T - 1` after this iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect these changes.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is equal to `4 + N`, for the loop to execute a second time `T` must be greater than 1**
