The variable `mnShots` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`_i`, `start`, `res`, and `monsters`) remain affected or unchanged due to the absence of any operations on them in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is increased by 1, `start` is updated to min(start, monsters[0][0] - dam), `res` contains an appended value of mnShots + start; `monsters` is an empty list; `mnShots` is 0.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is updated to min(start, monsters[0][0] - dam), `res` contains an appended value of mnShots + start; `monsters` is an empty list; `mnShots` is 0**.
