Postcondition: ***`_i` has been increased by 1; `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `mnShots` is updated to its new value with the addition of `dam`; `N` is greater than 1; `n` is 2; `cur` now contains the mapped integers from `inp[_i]`; `monsters` includes the previous values plus the current value of `cur`; `dam` is calculated as max(0, cur[0] - monsters[1][1]) and `mnShots` is updated accordingly.***
