The variable `monsters` is assigned an empty list, which does not depend on the values of `T` or `_i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is `5 + N`, and `monsters` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is `5 + N`, `monsters` is an empty list**
