Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is equal to `3 + N`, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` contains `N` `cur` map objects, `mnShots` is the sum of `dam` values for each iteration where `n > 0`, `start` is the minimum value calculated from the `cur` values across all iterations, and `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])` for each iteration where `n > 0`.**
