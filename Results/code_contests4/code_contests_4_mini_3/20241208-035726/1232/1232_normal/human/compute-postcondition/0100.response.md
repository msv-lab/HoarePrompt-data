Postcondition: ***`_i` has been increased by 1; `start` is the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `mnShots` is updated accordingly; `N` is greater than 1; `n` is 1; `cur` contains the mapped integers from `inp[_i]`; `monsters` includes the current value of `cur`. If `n` is greater than 0, `start` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cur[0] - dam`.***
