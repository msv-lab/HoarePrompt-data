The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`. The `_i` is `5 + N`, where `N` is greater than 0, meaning `_i` is also a positive integer. The `inp` list is being accessed at index `_i`, and the value at this index is expected to be a string that can be split into parts. Each part is then converted to an integer. The other variables remain unaffected by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment to `cur`, indicating that it is a mapped object of integers derived from the split string at index `_i`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is `5 + N`, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `cur` is a map object of integers from `inp[_i].split()`**.
