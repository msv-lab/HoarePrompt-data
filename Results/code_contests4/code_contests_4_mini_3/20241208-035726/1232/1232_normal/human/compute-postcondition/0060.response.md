The code `monsters.append(cur)` adds the `cur` object to the end of the `monsters` list. The `monsters` list already contains integers, and `cur` is a map object containing integers from the split input at index `_i` of `inp`. Since `monsters` is being modified by appending `cur`, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after the execution, `monsters` will now include the `cur` object as an additional element.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is at least 8, `monsters` is a list containing integers and now includes `cur`, `mnShots` is `dam`, `start` is either `start` or `cur[0] - dam`, `N` is greater than 0, and `n` is at least 8; `cur` is a map object containing integers from the split input at index `_i` of `inp`.**
