Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is at least 7, `monsters` is a list containing integers from `cur`, `mnShots` is `dam`, `start` is either `start` or `cur[0] - dam`, `N` is greater than 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is greater than 0, then `dam` is calculated as max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]) and the variables are updated accordingly.***
