The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its signature indicates no input parameters. However, it processes input based on predefined constraints where `T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it involves reading an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers `(a_i, b_i)` representing the health and explosion damage of each monster. 

The function outputs results based on the computations involving these test cases and their respective monster pairs. Although the specifics of the output are not detailed, it is implied that the function will return results based on the processing of the input data for each test case and the monsters.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case includes pairs of integers representing monster health and explosion damage, and it returns results based on the computations performed on these inputs.**
