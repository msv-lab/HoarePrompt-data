The value of `_i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `_i` is unknown, so we cannot specify its new value, but we know it has increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is increased by 1, `start` is assigned the value `maxint`, `res` contains an appended value of `mnShots + start`, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `n` is 0, and `cur` is assigned the mapped integers from `inp[_i].split()`.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is assigned the value `maxint`, `res` contains an appended value of `mnShots + start`, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `n` is 0, and `cur` is assigned the mapped integers from `inp[_i].split()`**.
