The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `_i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `_i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 2, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[1])`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 2, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[1])**
