According to the code, the loop will execute again if `n` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased by 1. Thus, `n` will become 1. 

Since `n` is being iterated over the range from 0 to `N-1`, and `N` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1. 

Therefore, the necessary state adjustments are:
- `n` is now 1, which means the loop will execute again.
- The values of `start`, `cur`, and `mnShots` may also need to be considered, but they are not specified for the next iteration in the given context.

State: **`_i` has been increased by 1, `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`, `mnShots` is updated accordingly, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1 and `n` is 1.**
