The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_i` is at least 7. Therefore, after execution, `_i` will be at least 8. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_i` is at least 8, `monsters` is a list containing integers from `cur`, `mnShots` is `dam`, `start` is either `start` or `cur[0] - dam`, `N` is greater than 0, and `n` is at least 8; `cur` is a map object containing integers from the split input at index `_i` of `inp`.**
