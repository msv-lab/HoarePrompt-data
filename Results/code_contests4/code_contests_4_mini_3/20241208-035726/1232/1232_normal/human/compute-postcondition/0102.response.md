The variable `cur` is assigned the result of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, which means it will convert the split strings from `inp[_i]` into integers. The previous value of `cur` is not explicitly defined, but it will now hold the mapped integers based on the contents of `inp[_i]`. The other variables (`_i`, `start`, `mnShots`, `N`, `n`, `monsters`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` has been increased by 1; `start` is the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `mnShots` is updated accordingly; `N` is greater than 1; `n` is 2; `cur` now contains the mapped integers from `inp[_i]`; `monsters` includes the current value of `cur`.
