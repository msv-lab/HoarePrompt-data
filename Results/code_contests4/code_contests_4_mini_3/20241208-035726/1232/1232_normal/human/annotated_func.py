#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000), followed by n pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^12) representing the health and explosion damage of each monster. The total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is the number of test cases, `_i` is equal to the total of all `N` values processed plus 3, `monsters` is a list of lists containing the mapped integers for each iteration, `start` is the minimum value from all iterations, `dam` is the last calculated damage, `mnShots` is the total accumulated shots, `res` is a list containing `T` values of `mnShots + start`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the health and explosion damage of monsters. It calculates the minimum number of shots required to defeat the monsters based on their health and the damage they can inflict. The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result is the total accumulated shots required plus the minimum health that can be sustained after the last monster. Edge cases include scenarios where no damage is inflicted or all monsters have health that can be negated by previous monsters' damage.
