Precondition: **T is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000), followed by n pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^12) representing the health and explosion damage of each monster. The total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000.**
