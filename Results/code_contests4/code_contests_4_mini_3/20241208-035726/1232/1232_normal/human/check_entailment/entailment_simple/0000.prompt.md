You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are playing another computer game, and now you have to slay n monsters. These monsters are standing in a circle, numbered clockwise from 1 to n. Initially, the i-th monster has a_i health.

You may shoot the monsters to kill them. Each shot requires exactly one bullet and decreases the health of the targeted monster by 1 (deals 1 damage to it). Furthermore, when the health of some monster i becomes 0 or less than 0, it dies and explodes, dealing b_i damage to the next monster (monster i + 1, if i < n, or monster 1, if i = n). If the next monster is already dead, then nothing happens. If the explosion kills the next monster, it explodes too, damaging the monster after it and possibly triggering another explosion, and so on.

You have to calculate the minimum number of bullets you have to fire to kill all n monsters in the circle.

Input

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000) — the number of test cases.

Then the test cases follow, each test case begins with a line containing one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) — the number of monsters. Then n lines follow, each containing two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^{12}) — the parameters of the i-th monster in the circle.

It is guaranteed that the total number of monsters in all test cases does not exceed 300000.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of bullets you have to fire to kill all of the monsters.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000), followed by n pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^12) representing the health and explosion damage of each monster. The total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000.
def func():
    stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))
    stdout = BytesIO()
    res = []
    inp = stdin.readlines()
    T = int(inp[0])
    _i = 1
    for t in range(T):
        N = int(inp[_i])
        
        _i += 1
        
        monsters = []
        
        mnShots = 0
        
        start = maxint
        
        for n in range(N):
            cur = map(int, inp[_i].split())
            _i += 1
            monsters.append(cur)
            if n > 0:
                dam = max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])
                mnShots += dam
                start = min(start, cur[0] - dam)
        
        dam = max(0, monsters[0][0] - monsters[-1][1])
        
        mnShots += dam
        
        start = min(start, monsters[0][0] - dam)
        
        res.append(mnShots + start)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is the number of test cases, `_i` is equal to the total of all `N` values processed plus 3, `monsters` is a list of lists containing the mapped integers for each iteration, `start` is the minimum value from all iterations, `dam` is the last calculated damage, `mnShots` is the total accumulated shots, `res` is a list containing `T` values of `mnShots + start`.
    os.write(1, '\n'.join(str(x) for x in res))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
