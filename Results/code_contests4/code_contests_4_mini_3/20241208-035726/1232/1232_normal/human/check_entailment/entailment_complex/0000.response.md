Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

### Explanation of the Faults:

1. **Damage Calculation Logic**: The program attempts to calculate the minimum shots required by considering the damage the previous monster can inflict when it explodes. However, the logic used to calculate the damage (`dam`) and the shots required (`mnShots`) does not account for the cascading effect of explosions correctly. Specifically, it seems to only account for the immediate previous monster's explosion damage, rather than considering how subsequent explosions can affect the total shots needed for all monsters.

2. **Handling of the First Monster**: The program calculates the damage for the first monster based on the last monster's explosion damage, which is incorrect. The explosion of the last monster should not directly influence the total shots needed for the first monster. Each monster's health should be evaluated based on the cumulative damage from all prior explosions, not just the last one.

3. **Minimum Shots Logic**: The way `mnShots` is accumulated does not properly follow the problem's requirement for calculating the minimum necessary shots. The program should ensure that each monster's health is fully accounted for after considering the damage received from the previous monster's explosion. The current logic can undercount the number of shots needed, especially when multiple explosions occur in sequence.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not seem robust against edge cases where multiple monsters can die in succession due to high explosion damage, leading to scenarios where the current logic would not calculate the required shots accurately.

In summary, the program's logic fails to fully implement the cascading explosion effect properly, leading to potential underestimation of the bullets needed to defeat all monsters, thus not fulfilling the requirements set forth in the problem description.
