Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. 

1. **Initialization of `cont`:** 
   - The program initializes `cont` to 2 when `n` is greater than 1. This assumes that the first tree can always be felled to the left and the last tree can always be felled to the right, which is not necessarily true. The first tree can only be felled to the left if it doesn't overlap with any occupied space from trees to the left, and the last tree can only be felled to the right if it doesn't overlap with any occupied space from trees to the right.

2. **Iteration through trees:**
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `len(p) - 1`, which means it skips checking the last tree entirely. This is problematic because the last tree may also be cut down, either to the left or to the right depending on its position relative to the previous tree.

3. **Handling the last tree:**
   - The program does not consider the last tree at all, which could lead to missed opportunities to count that tree if it can be cut down.

4. **Incorrect conditions:**
   - The conditions that check whether a tree can be felled to the left or right are not comprehensive enough. For example, it does not properly handle cases where a tree is too close to its neighbors.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:

```
3
1 2
2 1
3 2
```

In this case:
- The first tree at position `1` with height `2` can be felled to the left (occupying space `[-1, 1]`).
- The second tree at position `2` with height `1` can be cut to the right (occupying `[2, 3]`).
- The third tree at position `3` with height `2` cannot be felled to the left as it would overlap with the second tree's space if it's cut to the right.

The expected output is `3` because all trees can be felled. However, due to the issues in the implementation, the program will not correctly count the last tree. 

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the maximum number of trees that can be felled as per the problem description.
