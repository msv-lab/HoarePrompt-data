Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` contains at least 2 integers, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than or equal to `pivout`. If the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`, then `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is updated to `p[i] + h[i]`. Otherwise, if the sum is greater than or equal to `p[i + 1]`, then `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.***
