The code `h.append(e[1])` appends the second element of the map object `e` (which has been created to convert the split parts of the input string `n` into integers) to the list `h`. Given that `n` is a string that can be split into at least two parts (as it must be convertible to integers and has at least 1), `e[1]` refers to the second integer derived from `n`. The previous values of `h` and `e` indicate that `h` already contains some integers, and `e` contains the converted integers from `n`.

Since `h` is being modified by appending `e[1]`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `h` with the second integer appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged, so we will report their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an input string that must be convertible to an integer and at least 1; `p` has the first integer from `n` appended to it; `h` now contains the second integer from the split input string (after appending); `i` is 2; `e` is a map object that will convert each split part of the input string into an integer.**
