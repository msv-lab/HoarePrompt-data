The variable `p` is a list, and the code appends the first element of the map object `e`, which was created from splitting the string `n`. Since `e` is a map object of integers created from `n`, `e[0]` will give the first integer from this mapped object. 

Assuming `n` is a string that, when split, provides at least one integer (which is already guaranteed by the initial state), the value of `e[0]` will be the first integer from the string `n`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `p` is a list that will have the new value appended to it.
- `e[0]` is the first integer derived from the input string `n`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will reflect the updated state of `p` with the new integer added.

Output State: **`n` is an input string that must be convertible to an integer and at least 1; `p` has the first integer from `n` appended to it; `h` contains the second integer from the split input string; `i` is 1; `e` is a map object of integers created from the split input string.**
