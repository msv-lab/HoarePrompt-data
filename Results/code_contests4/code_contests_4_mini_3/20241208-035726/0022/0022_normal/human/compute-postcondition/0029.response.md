The value of `pivout` is assigned the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]`. Given that `p` contains at least 2 integers and `i` is 1, both `p[i]` and `h[i]` are valid and will contribute to the calculation. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` contains at least 2 integers, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than or equal to `pivout`, and the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`; `cont` is increased by 1; `pivout` is `p[i] + h[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` contains at least 2 integers, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than or equal to `pivout`, and the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`; `cont` is increased by 1; `pivout` is `p[i] + h[i]`.**
