Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `p` contains at least 4 integers. If `p[3] - h[3]` is greater than `pivout`, `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[3]`. Otherwise, if `p[3] + h[3]` is less than `p[4]`, `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[3] + h[3]`. If `p[3] + h[3]` is not less than `p[4]`, `pivout` is assigned the value from `p` at index 3.***
