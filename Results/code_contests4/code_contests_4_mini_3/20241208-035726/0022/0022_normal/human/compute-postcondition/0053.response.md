Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` and `n` pairs of integers representing the coordinates of trees. It determines how many trees can be placed without overlapping based on their positions and heights, and it prints this count. If `n` is 1, it returns 1; otherwise, it checks the distances between trees to count how many can fit without overlapping, printing that count. The function does not handle invalid input cases or ensure that `n` is convertible to an integer. **
