The value of `cont` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cont` is unknown, but it is increased without affecting other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` contains at least 2 integers, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, and `cont` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` contains at least 2 integers, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, and `cont` is increased by 1.**
