The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly since it is defined with empty parentheses. However, it operates on a set of constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each tree is represented by a pair of integers (xi, hi) where 1 ≤ xi, hi ≤ 10^9. The coordinates `xi` are given in strictly ascending order with no duplicates. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the return value directly. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters explicitly but operates on a set of constraints regarding an integer `n` and a list of tree representations as pairs of integers (xi, hi). The specific return value or functionality of the function is not provided.**
