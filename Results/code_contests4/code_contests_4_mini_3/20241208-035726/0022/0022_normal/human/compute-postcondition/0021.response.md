Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string that must be convertible to an integer and at least 1. If `n` is equal to 1, `p` contains the first integer from each of the `n` input strings, `h` contains the second integer from each of the `n` input strings, `i` is 0 (`n - 1`), `e` is a map object of integers created from the last split input string, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `cont` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cont` is set to 2 while maintaining that `p`, `h`, `i`, `e`, and `pivout` retain their respective values based on `n`.***
