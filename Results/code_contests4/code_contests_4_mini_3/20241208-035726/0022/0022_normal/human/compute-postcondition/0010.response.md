The code `h.append(e[1])` appends the second integer from the map object `e` to the list `h`. Since `e` is created from the split input string `n`, `e[1]` represents the second integer derived from that string. The list `h` will now contain this second integer in addition to its previous content. The values of `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input string that must be convertible to an integer and at least 1; `p` has the first integer from `n` appended to it; `h` now contains the second integer from the split input string; `i` is 1; `e` is a map object of integers created from the split input string.**
