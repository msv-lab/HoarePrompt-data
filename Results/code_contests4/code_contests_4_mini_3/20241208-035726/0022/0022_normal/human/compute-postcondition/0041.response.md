Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `p` contains at least 4 integers. If `p[i] - h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, then `cont` is incremented by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[2]`. Otherwise, if `p[i] + h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`, `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is set to `p[2] + h[2]`. If not, `pivout` is set to the third element of `p`.***
