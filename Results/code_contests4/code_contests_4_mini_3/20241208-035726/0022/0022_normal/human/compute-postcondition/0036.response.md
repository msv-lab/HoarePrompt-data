The variable `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, but the value of `p` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine what `p[i]` will be. Therefore, the output state remains uncertain regarding the value of `p[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; `cont` is incremented by 1; `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[2]` which is unknown.**
