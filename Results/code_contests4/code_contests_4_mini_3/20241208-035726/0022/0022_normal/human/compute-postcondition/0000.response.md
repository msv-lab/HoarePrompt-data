The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input as a string. Since `n` is described as an integer within the bounds of 1 to 100,000, it will ultimately need to be converted to an integer, but this line alone does not perform that conversion. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, as only `n` is being assigned the input value. Thus, the output state reflects the current status of `n` as a string input.

Output State: **`n` is an input string**
