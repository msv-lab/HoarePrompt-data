The variable `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i] + h[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `pivout` will be equal to the sum of the third element of `p` (since indexing starts from 0) and the third element of `h`. We know that `p` must contain at least 4 integers, but the specific values of `p` and `h` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot calculate an exact value for `pivout`. However, we can state that `pivout` depends on the values of `p[2]` and `h[2]`.

The other variables `n` and `cont` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `p` must contain at least 4 integers; `cont` is increased by 1; `pivout` is equal to `p[2] + h[2]`.**
