Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Single Tree Case**: The program initializes `cont` to 2 if `n` is greater than 1, which is incorrect. If there is only one tree, the maximum number of trees that can be cut is 1, as per the problem description. The initialization of `cont` should be adjusted accordingly.

2. **Loop Boundaries**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(p) - 1):` starts from 1 and ends at `len(p) - 2`, which means it does not consider the last tree in the calculations. This means that if there are more than two trees, the last tree will never be evaluated for being cut down, which could lead to an incorrect count.

3. **Conditions for Cutting Trees**: The conditions used within the loop to determine whether a tree can be cut down to the left or right do not cover all cases. The check `p[i] - h[i] > pivout` only allows for cutting left when it's possible, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where a tree may be cut down to the right even when the previous tree is cut down to the left. The logic needs to account for all scenarios of tree felling more comprehensively.

4. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3 (it should use `input()` instead). This is a practical issue that would prevent the program from running in a Python 3 environment.

Due to these issues, the program does not reliably implement the logic required by the problem description, leading to potentially incorrect outputs for various input cases.
