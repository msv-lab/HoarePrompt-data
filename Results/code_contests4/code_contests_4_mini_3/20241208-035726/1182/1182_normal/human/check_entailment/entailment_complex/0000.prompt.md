You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Snuke can change a string t of length N into a string t' of length N - 1 under the following rule:

* For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1), the i-th character of t' must be either the i-th or (i + 1)-th character of t.



There is a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Snuke's objective is to apply the above operation to s repeatedly so that all the characters in s are the same. Find the minimum necessary number of operations.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100
* s consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    b = []
    for k in range(len(a)):
        b.append(a[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a list containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is equal to the length of `a`.
    b = np.array(b)
    alp = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    al = []
    for k in range(len(alp)):
        al.append(alp[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 25, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now a list containing all letters from 'a' to 'z'.
    res = []
    for aa in al:
        if aa in b:
            res.append(np.where(b == aa))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 25, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list containing all letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` contains the indices of all letters from 'a' to 'z' that are present in `b`.
    m = []
    for k in range(len(res)):
        zz = np.hstack([np.array([0]), res[k][0], np.array([len(a)])])
        
        z = np.diff(zz)
        
        if len(z) > 0:
            m.append(np.max(z))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `res` contains the indices of letters present in `b`, `m` is a list containing the maximum distances between the indices, and `k` is equal to the length of `res`.
    if (len(m) > 0) :
        ans = np.min(m)
    else :
        ans = len(a)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `res` contains the indices of letters present in `b`, and `k` is equal to the length of `res`. If `m` is a non-empty list, then `ans` is assigned the minimum value from the list `m`. Otherwise, if `m` is empty, then `ans` is assigned the length of `a`.
    ans -= 1
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of lowercase English letters, calculates the maximum distance between the occurrences of each letter in the string, and then returns the minimum of these distances minus one. If there are no repeating letters, it returns the length of the string minus one. If the string contains only one character, it returns 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
