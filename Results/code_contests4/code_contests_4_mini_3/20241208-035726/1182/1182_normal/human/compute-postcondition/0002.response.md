According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will iterate over the length of `a`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `a` must have a length of at least 1. Given that `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop. At the start of the loop, `k` will begin at 0. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `a` must be a non-empty string, and `k` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a non-empty string and `k` is 0**
