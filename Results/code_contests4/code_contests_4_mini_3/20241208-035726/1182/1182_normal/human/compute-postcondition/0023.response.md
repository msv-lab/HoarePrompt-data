Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 25, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list containing all letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is now a list containing the indices of 'a' in `b`, and `aa` is 'a'. If `aa` (which is 'a') is in `b`, then `res` will contain the indices of 'a' in `b`.***
