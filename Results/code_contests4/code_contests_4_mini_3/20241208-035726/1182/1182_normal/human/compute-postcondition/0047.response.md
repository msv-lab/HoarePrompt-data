Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `res` contains at least 3 indices, `k` is 2, `zz` is [0, res[2][0], len(a)], `z` is [res[2][0], len(a) - res[2][0]]. If the length of `z` is greater than 0, `m` is updated to include the maximum value of `z`.***
