The code initializes an empty list `al`. No other variables are affected, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is an empty list.
