Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `res` contains at least 1 index, `k` is 0; `zz` is np.hstack([np.array([0]), res[0][0], np.array([len(a)])]), `z` is np.array([res[0][0], len(a) - res[0][0]]). If `len(z)` is greater than 0, `m` is updated to include the maximum value of `z`.***
