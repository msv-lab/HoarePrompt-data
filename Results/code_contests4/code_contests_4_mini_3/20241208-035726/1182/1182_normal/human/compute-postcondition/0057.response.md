Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of lowercase English letters, calculates the maximum distance between the occurrences of each letter in the string, and then returns the minimum of these distances minus one. If there are no repeating letters, it returns the length of the string minus one. If the string contains only one character, it returns 0. **
