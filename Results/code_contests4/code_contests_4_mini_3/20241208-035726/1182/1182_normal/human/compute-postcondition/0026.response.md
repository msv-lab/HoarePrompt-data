Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 25, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list containing all letters from 'a' to 'z', and `res` contains the indices of 'a' and 'b' in `b`. If `aa` is in `b`, `res` now contains the indices of both 'a' and 'b' in `b`.***
