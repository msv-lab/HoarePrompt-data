The variable `m` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect any of the other variables, which retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 25, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list containing all letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` contains the indices of all letters from 'a' to 'z' that are present in `b`, and `m` is an empty list.
