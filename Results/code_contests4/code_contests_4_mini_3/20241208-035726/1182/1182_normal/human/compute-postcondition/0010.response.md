The code assigns the string of all lowercase English letters to the variable `alp`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `b`, `a`, `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, and `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
