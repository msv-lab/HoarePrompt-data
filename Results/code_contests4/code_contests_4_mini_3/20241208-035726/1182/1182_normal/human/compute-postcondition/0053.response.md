Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `res` contains the indices of letters present in `b`, and `k` is equal to the length of `res`. If `m` is a non-empty list, then `ans` is assigned the minimum value from the list `m`. Otherwise, if `m` is empty, then `ans` is assigned the length of `a`.***
