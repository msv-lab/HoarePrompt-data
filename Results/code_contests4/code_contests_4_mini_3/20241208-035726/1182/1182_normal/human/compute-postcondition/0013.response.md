The variable `k` is 0, so when executing `al.append(alp[k])`, the character at index 0 of the string `alp` (which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') is 'a'. This value 'a' will be appended to the list `al`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 0, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now a list containing 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 0, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now a list containing 'a'**
