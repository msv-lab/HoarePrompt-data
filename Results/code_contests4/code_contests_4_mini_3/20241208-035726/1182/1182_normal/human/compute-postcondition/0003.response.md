The code appends the character from the string `a` at index `k` (which is 0) to the list `b`. Since `a` is a non-empty string, `a[k]` will retrieve the first character of the string `a` and append it to the list `b`. The list `b` will now contain this character. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a list containing the first character of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 0**
