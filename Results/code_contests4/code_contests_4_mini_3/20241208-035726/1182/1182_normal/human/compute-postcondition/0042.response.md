Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `res` contains at least 1 index, `k` is 1, `zz` is a numpy array containing the values [0, res[1][0], len(a)], and `z` is the array [res[1][0], len(a) - res[1][0]]. If the length of `z` is greater than 0, `m` is updated to include the maximum value from `z`.***
