The code snippet `res.append(np.where(b == aa))` appends the result of `np.where(b == aa)` to the list `res`. The variable `aa` is 'b', so we are looking for the indices of 'b' in the numpy array `b`. The previous state of `res` is a list containing the indices of 'a' in `b`. 

After executing the code, `res` will now contain the indices of 'a' and the indices of 'b' in `b`. The specific indices of 'b' depend on the contents of the numpy array `b`. 

Since the contents of `b` are not specified, we can only state that `res` is updated with the indices of 'b'. Therefore, the output state summarizes the current state of `res` including both 'a' and 'b' indices.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 25, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list containing all letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` now contains indices of 'a' and 'b' in `b`, `aa` is 'b'**.
