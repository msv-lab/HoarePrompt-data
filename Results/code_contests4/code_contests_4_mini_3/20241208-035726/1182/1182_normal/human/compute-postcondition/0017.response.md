The code `al.append(alp[k])` appends the character at index `k` of the string `alp` to the list `al`. Given that `k` is 2, the character at index 2 of `alp`, which is 'c', will be appended to `al`. 

The previous state of `al` contains 'a' and 'b', so after the execution of this line, `al` will now contain 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 2, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now ['a', 'b', 'c']**
