The variable `al` is a list that currently contains the element `'a'`. The code `al.append(alp[k])` accesses the character at index `k` of the string `alp`, which is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. Since `k` is 1, `alp[k]` is `'b'`. This value is then appended to the list `al`.

After executing the code, `al` will now contain two elements: `'a'` and `'b'`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string, `k` is 1, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now a list containing 'a', 'b'**
