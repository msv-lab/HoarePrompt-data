Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Output Mismatch**: The problem states that if the input is a vowel, the program should print `vowel`, and if it is a consonant, it should print `consonant`. However, the program prints `YES` for vowels and `NO` for consonants, which does not align with the expected outputs.

2. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not available in Python 3 (it should be `input()` instead). This could lead to issues when executing the program in a Python 3 environment.

3. **Vowel Check**: While the function does check the correct vowels, the implementation is not structured to return the expected outputs as described in the problem.

Because of these discrepancies, the program fails to accurately implement the described behavior.
