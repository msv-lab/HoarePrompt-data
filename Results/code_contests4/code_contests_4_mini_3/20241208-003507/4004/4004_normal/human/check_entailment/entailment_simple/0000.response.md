Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the program contains the following issues:

1. **Output Strings**: The problem description specifies that the output should be "vowel" if the input character is a vowel and "consonant" if it is not. However, the program prints "YES" for vowels and "NO" for consonants, which does not match the required output format.

2. **Function Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read the input, which is a method from Python 2. If this code were meant to run in Python 3, it should use `input()`. This discrepancy makes it incompatible with current Python standards unless specified otherwise.

3. **List of Vowels**: The list of vowels ['a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o'] is correct, but the overall logic and output do not align with what is required.

In summary, the program does not produce the expected output as specified in the problem description, which directly affects its correctness.
