Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the description, if the input character `c` is a vowel, it should print "vowel", and if it is not, it should print "consonant". However, the program prints "YES" for vowels and "NO" for consonants, which does not match the expected output format specified in the problem.

For example, if the input is `a`, the output should be "vowel", but the program will output "YES". Similarly, for an input of `z`, the expected output is "consonant", but the program will output "NO". 

Therefore, since the output does not conform to the problem requirements for any potential input, the program is incorrect.
