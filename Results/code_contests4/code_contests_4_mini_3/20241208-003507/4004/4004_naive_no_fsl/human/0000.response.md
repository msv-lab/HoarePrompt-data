Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it prints "YES" for vowels and "NO" for consonants, while the problem description requires it to print "vowel" for vowels and "consonant" for consonants. 

For example, if the input is 'a', the expected output is "vowel", but the program would output "YES". Similarly, for an input of 'z', the expected output is "consonant", while the program would output "NO". 

Thus, the program does not implement the correct logic as specified in the problem description, leading to incorrect outputs for the given inputs.
