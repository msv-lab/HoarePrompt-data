The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `li` containing `n` elements. It processes each integer in `li` to compute a series of values based on the divisibility of the integer by powers of `k`, tracking unique results. If a duplicate value is found during the computation, the function calls `func_2` with 'NO' and terminates; otherwise, it calls `func_2` with 'YES' after processing all integers. The function does not return any specific value.
