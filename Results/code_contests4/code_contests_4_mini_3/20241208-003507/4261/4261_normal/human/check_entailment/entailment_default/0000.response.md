To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the code and the output hints step by step.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine if an array `v` can be transformed into a given array `a` using a specific operation multiple times. The operation involves either incrementing an element of `v` by `k^i` for some step `i` or skipping that step. 

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `li`.
   - It initializes an empty set `req` to track the unique results of a specific computation.
   - For each integer `i` in `li`, it computes how many times `i` can be divided by increasing powers of `k`. 
   - It tracks the sum of powers in `j` and checks for duplicates in `req`. If a duplicate is found, it prints 'NO'. If no duplicates are found after processing all integers, it prints 'YES'.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is simply for printing outputs.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe the function's behavior accurately:
- The function processes each integer in the list to compute values based on divisibility by powers of `k`.
- It checks for duplicates, and if found, outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When all values in the target array `a` are `0`:**
   - The algorithm can simply skip all steps, thus it should return 'YES'.

2. **When `a` contains large values up to `10^16`:**
   - The function must correctly compute the powers of `k` and their combinations without encountering issues with integer overflow or incorrect logic.

3. **When `a` has duplicate values greater than the number of allowable increments:**
   - For example, if `a = [1, 1]` and `k = 2`, the function must detect that achieving two `1`s is impossible since you cannot achieve the same position with the same power increment more than once.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for incrementing `v` could fail if the required sum of powers exceeds the capacity of unique values that can be derived from the powers of `k`. 

An example case that showcases this flaw is:
- **Input:** `3 2` and `0 1 3`
  - For `a = [0, 1, 3]`, you cannot achieve `3` since it would require using `2^0` thrice, which is not allowed.

The hints imply that duplicates in the required positions could lead to a 'NO' return when they should be handled correctly based on unique combinations of powers.

### Final Assessment:
Correctness: **False**.

The program does not ensure that all cases, particularly where duplicates in the target array arise, are correctly handled, thus it does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
