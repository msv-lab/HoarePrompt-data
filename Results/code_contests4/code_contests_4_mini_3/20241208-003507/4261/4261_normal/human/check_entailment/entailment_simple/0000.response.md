To verify the correctness of the given annotated program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1()` and determine if it satisfies the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine if we can construct an array `v` filled with zeros, such that after a series of operations using powers of `k`, we can achieve a target array `a`. The operations allow us to add `k^i` to any position in the array or skip the step. 

### Program Logic Overview
1. The function `func_1` takes input for `n` (size of the array), `k` (the base for power), and the target array `li`.
2. It initializes an empty set `req` to track the unique powers of `k` used (or rather, their adjusted values).
3. For each element `i` in `li`, it enters a loop that attempts to reduce `i` by repeatedly dividing by powers of `k`.
4. The inner loop calculates how many times `i` can be divided by `k` raised to increasing powers. This is effectively counting how many times `k^0`, `k^1`, etc., can be used.
5. An adjusted index (`j`) is computed and checked against the set `req`. If `j` has been seen before, it returns 'NO'.
6. If the loop completes without finding duplicates in the adjusted indices, it concludes with 'YES'.

### Verification of Correctness
1. **Handling of the Powers**: The program correctly handles the construction of the target array by checking how many times a number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of `k`.
2. **No Duplicates**: The use of a set to track used powers ensures that the same power is not applied to multiple indices. This is crucial because the problem states that each power can only be used once per position.
3. **Final Output**: The program outputs 'YES' if it can achieve the target configuration and 'NO' otherwise, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
The program implements the algorithm as described in the problem statement. It correctly assesses whether the target array can be achieved through the described operations by managing powers of `k` and ensuring uniqueness of their application.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True**
