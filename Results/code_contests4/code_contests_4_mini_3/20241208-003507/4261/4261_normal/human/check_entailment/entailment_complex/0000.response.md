To assess the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1` against the requirements of the problem.

The problem states that we can increment elements of an array `v` starting from an array of zeros by adding powers of `k` at each step. The goal is to determine if we can transform the zeroed array into the given array `a` using the defined operations. 

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Initialization**: The program reads `n` (size of the array) and `k` (base for the powers) and then reads the target array `a`.

2. **Main logic in `func_1`**:
   - It initializes a `set` called `req` to track unique values of `j`.
   - For each element `i` in the target array `li` (which is the same as `a`):
     - It uses a loop to determine how many times the current element can be divided by increasing powers of `k`.
     - The variable `j` tracks how many times `i` can be divided by `k` powers.
     - It checks if this value `j` has already been seen (indicating that the same power of `k` would be used for two distinct elements in `a`), in which case it returns 'NO' since that would be impossible.
     - The operation continues until `i` is decremented to zero.

3. **Output**: If all elements are processed without duplication in the powers used, it outputs 'YES'.

### Potential Issues

1. **Duplicate Powers**: The check for duplicates works as intended. If two elements in `a` require the same power of `k` to be represented, then the program correctly identifies this as impossible.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program seems to handle the case where all elements in `a` are zero. It directly returns 'YES' since no operations are needed.

3. **Limits of `k`**: The program does not explicitly check for the limits of `a_i` (which can be as large as \(10^{16}\)). However, the logic using powers of `k` should be well within bounds since `k` has a maximum of 100 and `n` is limited to 30. 

4. **Handling of Non-zero Values**: The program handles non-zero values correctly by breaking down each element into its powers and checking the conditions.

5. **Case of Multiple Ones**: The code does not explicitly cover cases where values like `1` might appear multiple times in `a`, which can be problematic because `1` can only be generated by \(k^0\).

### Conclusion

After evaluating the code and the requirements of the problem description, we find that:

- If the target array contains the same power of `k` being required for different elements, the code correctly outputs 'NO'.
- Given the nature of powers, the program does not handle cases where multiple identical non-zero values can be formed, particularly the case of having two `1`s in the target array.

### Example of Failure

For instance, consider the input:
```
1 2
1 1
```
Here, `1` requires \(2^0\) to achieve, and thus the program will fail as it cannot fulfill the requirement of two `1`s with only one instance of \(2^0\).

### Final Verdict

Given the analysis, there exists a potential case where the program does not work correctly as per the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
