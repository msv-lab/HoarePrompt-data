The value of `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k ** j`. Since `j` is defined as the maximum value for which `i % k` holds true, `i` will be divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. However, the exact value of `j` is not provided, and thus the new value of `i` after the operation cannot be determined explicitly. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated to `i // (k ** j)`, `r` is 0, `j` is the maximum value for which `i % k` holds true, and `i` remains unchanged in terms of its initial state before division.
Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // (k ** j)`, `r` is 0, `j` is the maximum value for which `i % k` holds true**
