`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The values of `r`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 0; `j` is 1; `i` is 0; `k` is a non-zero integer.

Output State: **`r` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 0; `j` is 1; `i` is 0; `k` is a non-zero integer.**
