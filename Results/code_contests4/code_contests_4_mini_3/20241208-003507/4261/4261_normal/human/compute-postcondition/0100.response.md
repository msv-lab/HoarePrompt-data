According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. Currently, `i` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be a positive integer that is divisible by `k ** (j + 1)`. Since `j` is currently 0, the expression simplifies to `i % k == 0`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `k` (assuming `k` is positive) so that `i` can be divisible by `k`.

Thus, the state needs to be modified such that `i` is adjusted to ensure that it is a positive integer and divisible by `k`.

State: **`r` is 0; `j` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time `i` must be a positive integer and `i` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `k`**
