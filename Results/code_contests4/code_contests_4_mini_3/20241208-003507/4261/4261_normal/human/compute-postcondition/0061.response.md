The variable `r` is reassigned the value of 0, which replaces its previous value (the value of `li[0]`). Since the new value of `r` is explicitly set to 0, the previous value of `r` (which was `li[0]`) is no longer relevant. The variable `i` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment. Additionally, since `li` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute a second time, we acknowledge that `li` is not empty, but its contents are not specified in the given state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `r` is 0, and `li` contains at least one element**
