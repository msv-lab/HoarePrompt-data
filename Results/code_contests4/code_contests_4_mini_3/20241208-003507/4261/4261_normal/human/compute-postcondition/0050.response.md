In the provided code, `i` is being updated by performing an integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`. The values of `r` and `j` remain unchanged. Since `j` is derived from the maximum integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, `j` has a specific value based on the initial state of `i` and `k`. After the operation, `i` will be reduced and its new value will be `i // (k ** j)`. 

The output will reflect the changes in `i`, while `r` and `j` will retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is the maximum integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, and `i` is updated to `i // (k ** j)`.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is the maximum integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, `i` is updated to `i // (k ** j)`**.
