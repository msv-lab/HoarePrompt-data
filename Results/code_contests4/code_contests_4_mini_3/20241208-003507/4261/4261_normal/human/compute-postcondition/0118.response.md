The variable `r` is assigned the value 0. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `r` is 0, and for the loop to execute a second time, `li` must contain at least one element.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `r` is 0, and for the loop to execute a second time, `li` must contain at least one element.**
