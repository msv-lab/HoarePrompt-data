The value of `j` is assigned the value `0`. Previously, `j` was greater than or equal to `1`, so this assignment violates that condition. The state of other variables remains unchanged: `r` is `j` (now `0`), `i` is adjusted to be greater than `0`, `k` is a non-zero integer, `j` is not in `req`, and `j` was added to `req`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is adjusted to be greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer, `j` is not in `req`, and `j` is added to `req`.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is adjusted to be greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer, `j` is not in `req`, and `j` is added to `req.**
