`i` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown based on the initial state. The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is still assigned the value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is assigned the value of `j`; `i` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`r` is assigned the value of `j`; `i` is decreased by 1.**
