`req` is a set that will have the current value of `j` added to it. The initial state indicates that `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` has been increased by `r` indefinitely, meaning it can take on any value greater than or equal to 1. Since `j` is not in `req` before the operation, after executing `req.add(j)`, `j` will be included in the `req` set. The values of `i` and `j` do not change, but `req` now includes the value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is added to `req`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is added to `req`**
