The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes -1. The values of `j` and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is -1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is equal to `j` (which is greater than or equal to 1).

Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is equal to `j` (which is greater than or equal to 1)**
