The value of `i` is decremented by 1, and since `i` is initially -1, it becomes -2. The values of `j` and `r` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is -2; `j` is either 0 or unbounded; `r` is either 0 or unbounded.

Output State: **`i` is -2; `j` is either 0 or unbounded; `r` is either 0 or unbounded**
