Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000), `args` contains at least `n` elements, `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file between each element of `args` after the first element, a value (either from `kwargs` or a newline) is written to the file. If the `flush` argument from `kwargs` is True, the file's internal buffer is flushed to ensure all data is written to the file.***
