To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Right before the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is 0, and `r` is 0.
   - The condition for the while loop is `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, which simplifies to `i % k == 0` since `j + 1` equals 1 (because `j` is 0).

2. **Understanding the Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be divisible by `k`, meaning `i % k` should equal 0.
   - Currently, `i` is -1. The only way for `-1 % k` to equal 0 is if `k` is a value that adjusts the modulus condition. However, typically for positive integers, `-1 % k` will not equal 0 for any positive value of `k`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, to allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust the value of `i` to a multiple of `k`. 
   - Since `i` is currently -1, we can set `i` to 0 (the smallest non-negative multiple of any positive integer).

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to set `i` to 0 for the loop to satisfy the condition.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `r` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` must be a multiple of `k`**
