The value of `j` is assigned 0. The variable `r` was previously assigned the value of `j`, so now `r` also becomes 0. The variable `i` is not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0; `j` is 0; `i` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`r` is 0; `j` is 0; `i` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
