According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, `j` is 2, and `k` must be equal to 1 for the loop to execute again. 

Calculating the value of `k ** (j + 1)` gives us `1 ** (2 + 1) = 1`. Therefore, we need to check if `-1 % 1 == 0`. Since `-1 % 1` equals `0`, the condition holds true, and the loop can execute again.

None of the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time as the condition is satisfied with the current state.

State: **`i` is -1, `j` is 2, `k` must be equal to 1**
