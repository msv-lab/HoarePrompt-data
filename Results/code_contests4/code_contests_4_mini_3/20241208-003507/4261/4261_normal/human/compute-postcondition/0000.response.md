The provided code snippet is a comment that describes the function of a print statement in Python but does not change any variables or produce any output. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30) and `k` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100); and the second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_i` (0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^16) representing the target array.**
