Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, as long as `k` is any positive integer. The loop continues to increment `j` until `i` is no longer divisible by `k^(j+1)`, which will never happen in this case since `i` is 0. The loop will execute indefinitely increasing `j` without bound.**
