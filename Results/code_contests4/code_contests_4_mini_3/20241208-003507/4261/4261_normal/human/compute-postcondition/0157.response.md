According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i % k ** (j + 1)` must be equal to 0. 

Right before the loop, `i` is -1 and `j` is 0. This means the condition being evaluated is `-1 % k ** (1) == 0`, or `-1 % k == 0`. 

For the modulo operation to result in 0, `-1` must be divisible by `k`. This is only true if `k` is equal to 1, as any other value would not divide -1 evenly (the modulo operation would yield a non-zero remainder).

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
1. The value of `k` must be adjusted to ensure that `-1` is divisible by `k`. Hence, `k` must be set to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is -1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `k` must be equal to 1**
