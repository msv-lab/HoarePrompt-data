The function `func_1` accepts parameters `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. The parameter `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^16. After executing the function body, regardless of the case, the function does not return any specific value or variable. In all cases, the function effectively terminates without providing a return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T, n, k, and a, but does not return any specific value or variable; it simply terminates without a return value.**
