The code assigns default values to `sep` and `file` by popping them from the `kwargs` dictionary. Specifically, it attempts to retrieve the value for `sep` and `file` from `kwargs`, and if those keys do not exist, it will assign them the default values of `' '` (a space) and `sys.stdout`, respectively. The initial state does not affect the values of `T`, `n`, `k`, or the array `a_i`. Therefore, the output state is focused on the new values of `sep` and `file`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000), for each test case `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30), `k` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100); `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.**
