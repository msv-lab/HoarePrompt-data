To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

1. **Variables Description**:
   - `i`: is greater than 0.
   - `r`: is 0 (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `li`: contains at least one element (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `j`: is assigned the value 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop can iterate as long as `i` is divisible by `k ** (j + 1)`. Since `j` is initialized to 0, the condition becomes `i % k == 0`.

3. **Current State**:
   - We know `i` is greater than 0, but we do not have information about `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be defined and `i` must be divisible by `k`. 

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since we need the loop to execute at least once, we must ensure that `k` is set in such a way that `i` is divisible by `k`. Therefore, `k` must be a positive integer less than or equal to `i`.

So, to allow the loop to execute:
- `k` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to `i`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `li` contains at least one element, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be a positive integer such that `k <= i`**
