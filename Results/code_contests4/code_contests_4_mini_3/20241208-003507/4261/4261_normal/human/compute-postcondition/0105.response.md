`j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 3 to 4. The states of the other variables, `r` and `i`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is 4, and `i` is unchanged, with the loop condition still pending for execution based on `i % k`.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 4, and `i` is unchanged, with the loop condition still pending for execution based on `i % k.**
