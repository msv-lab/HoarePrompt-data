The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes -1. The states of the other variables (`r`, `j`, `k`, and `req`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is `j`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `k` is a non-zero integer, `j` is not in `req`, and `j` is added to `req`.

Output State: **`r` is `j`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `k` is a non-zero integer, `j` is not in `req`, and `j` is added to `req.**
