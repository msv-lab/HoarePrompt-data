According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i % k ** (j + 1)` must equal 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1 and `j` is 1. 

Calculating the condition, we have:
- `j + 1` is 2, so we need to check if `-1 % k ** 2 == 0`.
- This means that `k ** 2` must be a divisor of -1.

Since -1 is not divisible by any positive integer, `k` must be adjusted. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be adjusted to a value that is divisible by `k ** 2`. 

Thus, we can conclude that `k` needs to be adjusted to a value that allows `-1` to satisfy the condition. The simplest adjustment would be to set `k` to 1, as `-1 % 1` equals 0.

State: **`i` is -1, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be equal to 1**
