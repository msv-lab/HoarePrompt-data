The value of `i` is decremented by 1, where the initial value of `i` is 0. Thus, after execution, `i` becomes -1. The values of `j` and `r` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is -1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is equal to `j`**
