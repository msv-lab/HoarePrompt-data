The value of `j` is incremented by `r`, which is currently 0. Therefore, `j` remains unchanged, and since `r` is 0, `j` will still be greater than or equal to 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-zero integer.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-zero integer**
