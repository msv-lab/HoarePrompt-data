The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters as its signature does not include any input variables. However, it operates based on the constraints provided regarding `T`, `n`, `k`, and a list of integers `a_i` for multiple test cases.

The output of the function is determined by the following cases:
- Case_1: The function processes multiple test cases specified by the positive integer `T`.
- For each test case, if `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 100, the function uses a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is within the range of 0 to 10^16.

Based on these input constraints and relationships, the function will produce output for each test case according to its internal logic, which is not specified.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to handle multiple test cases based on the given constraints and return results for those cases.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases defined by a positive integer T and for each test case, it accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), an integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and an array of n integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^16), returning results based on the specified input constraints.**
