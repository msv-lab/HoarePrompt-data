`j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is 3, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-zero integer.
Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 3, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-zero integer**
