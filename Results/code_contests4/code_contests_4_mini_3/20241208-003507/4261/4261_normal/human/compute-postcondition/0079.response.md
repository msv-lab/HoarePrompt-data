The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was updated to `i // k`, while `j` was increased by `r`, and `r` is equal to the previous value of `j`. Since the values of `k` and `j` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `i` or `j` after the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `i` while noting the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k` and then decremented by 1; `j` is increased by `r`, `r` is equal to the previous value of `j`.**
