`j` is incremented by 1, and since `j` was initially 1, it becomes 2 after the execution. The values of `r`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-zero integer.
Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-zero integer**
