According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` modulo `k` raised to the power of `j + 1` must equal 0. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is initialized to 0. 

Since `i` is 0, regardless of the value of `k`, `0 % k ** (j + 1)` will always equal 0 (as long as `k` is not 0). Thus, the loop can execute without any adjustments needed to `i` or `j`. However, we need to ensure `k` is not equal to 0, as that would make the expression undefined.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is that `k` must be a non-zero integer. 

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is initialized to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be a non-zero integer**
