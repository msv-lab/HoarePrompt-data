The value of `i` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables `j`, `req`, and `r` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is added to `req`, `r` is assigned the current value of `j`, and `i` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is added to `req`, `r` is assigned the current value of `j`, and `i` is decremented by 1.**
