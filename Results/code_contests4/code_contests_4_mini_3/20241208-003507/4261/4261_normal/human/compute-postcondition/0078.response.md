The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is increased by `r` before this code executes. Therefore, the output state reflects that `r` is now equal to the previous value of `j`. The states of `i` and `req` are not directly impacted by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, `r` is now equal to the previous value of `j`.**
