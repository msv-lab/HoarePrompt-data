According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will only execute if `i` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. The variable `r` and the list `li` do not affect the execution of the loop in this case.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, and `li` contains at least one element**
