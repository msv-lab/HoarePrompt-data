According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which means the loop cannot execute even once. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 in order for the loop to execute for the first time. The condition regarding `li` containing at least one element is irrelevant for the execution of the loop since the loop's execution solely depends on the value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` must be greater than 0**
