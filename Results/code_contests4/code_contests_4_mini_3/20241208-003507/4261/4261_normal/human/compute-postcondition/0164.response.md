The operation `i //= k ** j` modifies the value of `i` by performing an integer division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. 

In the given initial state:
- `i` is -1.
- `j` depends on the value of `k`:
  - If `k` > 1, then `j` is 0, so `k ** j` equals `k ** 0`, which is 1.
  - If `k` = 1, then `j` is unbounded (effectively infinite), leading to `k ** j` being 1 regardless of the value of `j` since any number to the power of 0 is 1.

If `k` > 1:
- As `j` is 0, `i //= k ** j` becomes `i //= 1`, which means `i` remains -1.

If `k` = 1:
- Since `j` is unbounded, `i //= k ** j` becomes `i //= 1`, meaning `i` also remains -1.

Based on the scenarios:
- If `k` > 1, `i` remains -1 and `j` is 0.
- If `k` = 1, `i` remains -1 and `j` is unbounded.

Thus, the output state will reflect both possibilities for `k`.

Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` is 0 if `k` > 1; `i` is -1, `j` is unbounded if `k` = 1**
