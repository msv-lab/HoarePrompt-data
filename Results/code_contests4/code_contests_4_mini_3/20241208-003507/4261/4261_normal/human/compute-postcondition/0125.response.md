To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

The current state shows that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, the condition must hold true. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Current Values**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The expression `k ** (j + 1)` simplifies to `k ** 3` (since `j + 1` is 3).
   - The condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` translates to `0 % k ** 3 == 0`. This condition will always be true for any value of `k` because 0 is divisible by any non-zero number.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `i` is 0, the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` will always evaluate to true regardless of the value of `k`. Thus, the loop can execute again without any modifications to the current state.

Since the `while` loop can definitely execute one more time, we can repeat the program state as is. 

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2**.
