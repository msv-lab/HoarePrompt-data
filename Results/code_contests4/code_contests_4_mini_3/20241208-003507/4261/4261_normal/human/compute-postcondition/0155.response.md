According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, which means it does not satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0. 

State: **`i` is -1 and for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be greater than 0**
