The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. Since `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and is not an element of `req`, it will be successfully added to the set. The values of `i`, `r`, and the unchanged state of `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0, and `j` is now an element of `req`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0, and `j` is now an element of `req`.**
