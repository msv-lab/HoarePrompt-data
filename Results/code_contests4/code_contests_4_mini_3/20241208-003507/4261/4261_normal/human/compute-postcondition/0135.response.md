`r` is assigned the value of `j`, and since `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` will also be greater than or equal to 1. The states of the other variables `i` and `req` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is equal to `j`**
