`r` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` can either be 0 or unbounded, the value of `r` will also be either 0 or unbounded. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is -1; `j` is either 0 or unbounded; `r` is either 0 or unbounded.

Output State: **`i` is -1; `j` is either 0 or unbounded; `r` is either 0 or unbounded**
