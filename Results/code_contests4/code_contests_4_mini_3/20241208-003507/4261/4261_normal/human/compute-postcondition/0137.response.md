According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, which means it is not greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. Other variables `j` and `r` do not impact the loop condition.

State: **`i` is -1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is equal to `j` and for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 0**
