Functionality: ** The function accepts a variable number of arguments and keyword arguments, writes the string representations of the arguments to a specified output stream separated by a defined separator (defaulting to a space), and appends an end character (defaulting to a newline) after the last argument. The function also has an option to flush the output stream if specified. However, the function does not handle the test cases or input constraints mentioned in the initial comments, as it lacks parameters for `T`, `n`, `k`, and the target array, making the comments misleading. **
