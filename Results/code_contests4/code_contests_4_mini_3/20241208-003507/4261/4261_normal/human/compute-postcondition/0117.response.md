According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `li`. If `li` has at least one more element after the current index `i`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, which means that the loop has either just finished its last execution or has not executed yet if `li` starts indexing from 0. 

If `i` is -1, it indicates that the loop has either just started or completed without further elements to process. Since `i` is decremented to -1 after the loop finishes and assuming it was initially greater than 0, it suggests that the loop has iterated through all elements in `li` up to the last index. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` back to 0 (if this is the first execution attempt) and ensure that the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute a second time, `li` must contain at least one element.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `li` must contain at least one element.**
