`j` is incremented by the value of `r`. Since `r` is 0, the value of `j` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0, and `j` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0, and `j` remains unchanged**.
