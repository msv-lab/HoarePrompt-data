To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we examine the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. The loop will execute if the expression evaluates to true.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1

Now, we check the condition:
- The expression becomes `0 % k ** (1 + 1) == 0`, which simplifies to `0 % k ** 2 == 0`. 

Since the modulus of 0 with any number is 0, the condition will always be true regardless of the value of `k`, as long as `k` is not zero. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one more time without needing to adjust any of the states.

Thus, the program state remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1**
