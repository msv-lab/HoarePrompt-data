Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000), `args` contains at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file, and the value of `x` is written to the file as a string. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file.***
