According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0, which means it needed to have been at least 1 before the decrease. 

State: **`r` is assigned the value of `j`; `i` is decreased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 0**
