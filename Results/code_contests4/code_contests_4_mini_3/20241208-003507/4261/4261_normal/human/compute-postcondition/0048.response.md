The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `j` is 2, after execution, `j` becomes 3. The values of `r` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be divisible by `k`.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be divisible by `k.**
