The function `func_2('NO')` is called, but without knowing the internal implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine how it affects the variables `i`, `j`, or `r`. Since `i`, `j`, and `r` are not modified by this function call based on the information provided, their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and remains unchanged, `r` is 0, and `j` is an element of `req`. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and remains unchanged, `r` is 0, and `j` is an element of `req`**.
