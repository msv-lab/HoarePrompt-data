According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. This means that for the loop to execute, `i` must be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

Right before the loop, `i` has been updated to `i // k`, which means it has been divided by `k` and then decremented by 1. The value of `j` is initialized to 0. 

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that:

1. `i` (after being updated to `i // k - 1`) must be divisible by `k ** (j + 1)` which simplifies to `k ** 1` since `j` is 0. Therefore, `i // k - 1` must be divisible by `k`.
2. This means that `i // k - 1` should be at least 0, and hence `i // k` must be at least 1.

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is large enough after the update to ensure it is still divisible by `k` when decremented by 1.

State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, then decremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` must be at least `k + 1`**
