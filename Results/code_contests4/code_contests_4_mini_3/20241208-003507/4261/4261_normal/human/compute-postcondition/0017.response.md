The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The previous value of `x` is known to be the third element in `args` and is already written to the file as a string. Since `at_start` is False, the variable `sep` is also written to the file prior to this operation. However, the current operation specifically focuses on writing `x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000), `args` contains at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file, `x` is written to the file as a string.**
