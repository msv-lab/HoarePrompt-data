According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, which means it cannot execute again because -1 is not greater than 0. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. Since there are no other conditions affecting the loop's execution based on the other variables, only `i` needs to be modified.

State: **`r` is `j`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is adjusted to be greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer, `j` is not in `req`, and `j` is added to `req`**
