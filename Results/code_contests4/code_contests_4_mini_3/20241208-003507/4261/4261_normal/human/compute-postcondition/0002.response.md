The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The previous states of `T`, `n`, `k`, `sep`, and `file` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000), for each test case `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30), `k` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100); `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000), for each test case `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30), `k` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100); `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True.**
