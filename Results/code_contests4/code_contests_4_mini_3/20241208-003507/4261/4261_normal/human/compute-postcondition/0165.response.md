The value of `j` is incremented by `r`. The value of `j` depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 1, then `j` is initially 0, and if `k` is equal to 1, `j` is unbounded. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `j`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is -1; `j` is either 0 or unbounded depending on the value of `k`, and `j` is increased by `r`.

Output State: **`i` is -1; `j` is either 0 or unbounded depending on the value of `k`, and `j` is increased by `r.**
