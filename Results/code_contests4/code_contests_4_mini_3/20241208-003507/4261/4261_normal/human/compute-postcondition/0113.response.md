The code snippet `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. Since `j` is not already in `req`, it gets added without affecting the other variables. The previous values of `i`, `k`, `j`, and `r` are not directly impacted by this operation. Therefore, the output will reflect that `j` has been added to `req`.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is added to `req`**.
