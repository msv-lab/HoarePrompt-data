The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The values of `r`, `j`, and `req` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is the maximum integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, and `j` is added to the set `req`; `i` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`r` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is the maximum integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, and `j` is added to the set `req`; `i` is decremented by 1.**
