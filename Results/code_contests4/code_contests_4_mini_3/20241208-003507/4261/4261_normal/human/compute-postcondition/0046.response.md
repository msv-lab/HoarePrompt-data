`j` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The values of `r` and `i` remain unchanged, and the requirement for the loop to execute again (that `i` must be divisible by `k`) is still present but not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is 2, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be divisible by `k`. 

Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 2, and `i` must be divisible by `k for the loop to execute again.**
