The value of `j` is assigned to 0, which means it is no longer greater than or equal to 1. The previous values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged; thus, `i` is -1 and `r` is equal to the previous value of `j`, which is now 0. Since the loop condition requires `i` to be greater than 0 for it to execute again, it will not execute again due to `i` being -1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is -1, `j` is 0, `r` is 0, and the loop condition for execution is not satisfied.

Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` is 0, `r` is 0, and the loop condition for execution is not satisfied.**
