The value of `i` is being modified by the operation `i //= k ** j`. However, since the initial value of `i` is 0, the result of `i //= k ** j` will still be 0, as any number divided by a non-zero number remains 0. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1, but it does not affect the outcome since `i` is 0. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0**
