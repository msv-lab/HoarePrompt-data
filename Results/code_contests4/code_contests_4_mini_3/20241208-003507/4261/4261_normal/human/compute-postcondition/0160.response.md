The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since `j` was initially 1, after execution, `j` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is -1, `j` is 2, `k` must be equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` is 2, `k` must be equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.**
