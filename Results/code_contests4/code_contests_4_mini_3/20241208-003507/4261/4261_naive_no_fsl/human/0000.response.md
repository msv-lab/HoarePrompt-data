To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic within `func_1()` and determine if it correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement.

The key points of the problem are:
1. We start with an array `v` initialized to zeroes.
2. At each step `i`, we can either increase an element of `v` by `k^i` or skip the step.
3. We must check if we can make `v` equal to the target array `a`.

The provided function `func_1()` attempts to achieve this by:
- Reading the required values and the target array `a`.
- Using a set `req` to track the unique indices where additions occur.
- For each element in `a`, it calculates how many times `k^j` can be used by repeatedly dividing the element by increasing powers of `k` (i.e., `k^0, k^1, k^2, ...`).
- It checks if the sum of these divisions results in any duplicate indices in `req`. If a duplicate is found, it returns 'NO', otherwise 'YES' if it processes all elements successfully.

However, upon deeper inspection, there are potential cases where this logic fails:
- The program does not correctly handle cases where multiple occurrences of the same power of `k` are required to reach different indices in `v`. For example, if `a = [2, 2]` and `k = 2`, the algorithm would incorrectly conclude that it is impossible to achieve this because it would require using `2^0` for both indices, which is not allowed based on the current implementation that tracks the sum of indices in the set.

Given this understanding, we can conclude that the program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

This is because it fails to account for cases where the same power of `k` can be required multiple times for different positions in the desired array `a`.
