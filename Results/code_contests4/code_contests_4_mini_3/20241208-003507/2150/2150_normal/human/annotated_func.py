#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) representing the number of vertices in the tree, and b is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) contains two integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges connecting the vertices in the tree. The length of b is n - 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    Q = deque()
    Q.append(a)
    seen = {b}
    cnt = 0
    while Q:
        a = Q.popleft()
        
        if a in seen:
            continue

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `Q` is empty, `seen` contains all unique elements that were reachable from the initial elements in `Q`, `cnt` is equal to the number of unique elements processed from `Q`, and `a` is the last integer removed from `Q` before it became empty.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the number of unique elements processed from Q, which is equal to cnt
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of vertices in a tree and a list of tuples `b` representing the edges between the vertices. It processes these vertices using a breadth-first search approach to count and return the number of unique vertices that can be reached from the starting vertex `a`. However, the function may not correctly handle the edges since `E[a]` is not defined within the code, which implies that the function could raise an error or not work as intended if the adjacency list `E` is not properly set up. Additionally, the check for `if a in seen:` should be based on whether `a` has already been processed, but the initial population of `seen` is incorrect as it starts with `{b}` instead of an empty set. Therefore, the function may not function correctly if the initial conditions are not met.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the vertices connected by an edge, forming a valid tree structure.
def func_2(node):
    print(node)
    if (node in seen) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `node` is printed, and `node` is not in `seen`.
    seen.add(node)
    sz[node] = 1
    for neigh in E[node]:
        print(neigh)
        
        sz[node] += func_2(neigh)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `node` is printed and added to `seen`; `sz[node]` is equal to 1 plus the sum of the return values of `func_2` for all neighbors in `E[node]`; `neigh` is the last neighbor in `E[node]` printed during the loop execution.
    return sz[node]
    #The program returns the size of the subtree rooted at 'node', which is equal to 1 plus the sum of the sizes of all its neighbors in 'E[node]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `node` representing a vertex in a tree and returns 0 if `node` has been visited previously (indicating it is a leaf in the context of the function's execution); otherwise, it returns the size of the subtree rooted at `node`, calculated as 1 plus the sum of the sizes of all its neighboring nodes in `E[node]`. The function uses a global `seen` set to track visited nodes to prevent counting them multiple times.
