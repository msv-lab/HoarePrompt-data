To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed from a tree such that all remaining connected components have even sizes. If it's impossible to get all components to have even sizes after edge removals, the output should be -1.

### Function Analysis:

#### Function 1:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    Q = deque()
    Q.append(a)
    seen = {b}
    cnt = 0
    while Q:
        a = Q.popleft()
        if a in seen:
            continue
        cnt += 1
        seen.add(a)
        for b in E[a]:
            Q.append(b)
    return cnt
```
- This function is intended to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to count unique vertices reachable from a starting vertex `a`. 
- However, it has issues:
  - `E[a]` is not defined in the scope of the function, suggesting that it relies on a global variable that may not be properly initialized before this function is called.
  - The set `seen` starts incorrectly with `{b}`, which could lead to incorrect counting since it improperly assumes `b` is the only node that has been seen.

#### Function 2:
```python
def func_2(node):
    print(node)
    if node in seen:
        return 0
    seen.add(node)
    sz[node] = 1
    for neigh in E[node]:
        print(neigh)
        sz[node] += func_2(neigh)
    return sz[node]
```
- This function seems to correctly calculate the size of the subtree rooted at `node` while marking nodes as seen.
- The output hints mention that this function returns 0 if a node has already been visited. This seems to be a misunderstanding; the function returns 0 but continues to sum the sizes of subtrees for unvisited nodes.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- If the total number of nodes `n` is odd, the program immediately outputs -1. This is correct because an odd-sized tree cannot be split into components that are all even-sized.
- If `n` is even, the function counts how many edges can be removed without resulting in odd-sized components. 

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints indicate potential issues with the first function's ability to handle the edges due to the undefined `E[a]`.
- There is uncertainty regarding the correctness of the BFS performed in `func_1`, as it may not function correctly given its reliance on an improperly initialized adjacency list.

### Conclusion:
The code does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case, especially due to the issues with `func_1` and the potential for the code to fail when handling the adjacency list. Additionally, the incorrect initialization of `seen` in `func_1` suggests that edge cases may lead to incorrect results or exceptions being raised.

The hints also reflect potential issues and reinforce that the first function is faulty due to its reliance on an undefined variable.

**Correctness: False**. The program does not meet the problem requirements due to the issues in `func_1` and its potential failure to handle certain scenarios correctly.
