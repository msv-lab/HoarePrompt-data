You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have even size.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) denoting the size of the tree. 

The next n - 1 lines contain two integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) each, describing the vertices connected by the i-th edge.

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

Output

Output a single integer k — the maximum number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size, or -1 if it is impossible to remove edges in order to satisfy this property.

Examples

Input

4
2 4
4 1
3 1


Output

1

Input

3
1 2
1 3


Output

-1

Input

10
7 1
8 4
8 10
4 7
6 5
9 3
3 5
2 10
2 5


Output

4

Input

2
1 2


Output

0

Note

In the first example you can remove the edge between vertices 1 and 4. The graph after that will have two connected components with two vertices in each.

In the second example you can't remove edges in such a way that all components have even number of vertices, so the answer is -1.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    Q = deque()
    Q.append(a)
    seen = {b}
    cnt = 0
    while Q:
        a = Q.popleft()
        if a in seen:
            continue
        cnt += 1
        seen.add(a)
        for b in E[a]:
            Q.append(b)
    return cnt
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of vertices in a tree and a list of tuples `b` representing the edges between the vertices. It processes these vertices using a breadth-first search approach to count and return the number of unique vertices that can be reached from the starting vertex `a`. However, the function may not correctly handle the edges since `E[a]` is not defined within the code, which implies that the function could raise an error or not work as intended if the adjacency list `E` is not properly set up. Additionally, the check for `if a in seen:` should be based on whether `a` has already been processed, but the initial population of `seen` is incorrect as it starts with `{b}` instead of an empty set. Therefore, the function may not function correctly if the initial conditions are not met.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(node):
    print(node)
    if node in seen:
        return 0
    seen.add(node)
    sz[node] = 1
    for neigh in E[node]:
        print(neigh)
        sz[node] += func_2(neigh)
    return sz[node]
if sys.version_info < (3, 0):
    range = xrange
input = sys.stdin.readline
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
n = int(input())
edges = []
E = dd(list)
for _ in range(n - 1):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    E[a].append(b)
    E[b].append(a)
    edges.append((a, b))
if n % 2 == 1:
    print(-1)
    sys.exit()
leafs = [e for e in E if len(E[e]) == 1]
sz = {}
seen = set()
root = leafs[0]
func_2(root)
cuts = 0
for (a, b) in edges:
    val = min(sz[a], sz[b])
    if val % 2 == 0:
        cuts += 1
print(cuts)
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts an integer `node` representing a vertex in a tree and returns 0 if `node` has been visited previously (indicating it is a leaf in the context of the function's execution); otherwise, it returns the size of the subtree rooted at `node`, calculated as 1 plus the sum of the sizes of all its neighboring nodes in `E[node]`. The function uses a global `seen` set to track visited nodes to prevent counting them multiple times.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
