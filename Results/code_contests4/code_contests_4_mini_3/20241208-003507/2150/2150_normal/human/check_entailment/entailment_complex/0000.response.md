Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem states that the goal is to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed from the tree such that all remaining connected components have even sizes. However, the code does not implement any logic to check or count the sizes of the connected components after potential edge removals.

Key issues with the code include:

1. **Undefined Variables**: The variable `E` is referenced in the functions but is not defined anywhere in the code. This will lead to errors during execution.

2. **Logic for Component Size**: The logic to determine whether a component can be formed with even sizes is not present. The code should involve checking the subtree sizes and counting the edges that can be removed based on whether the subtree sizes are even or not.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The annotations suggest that there is an assumption that the tree can have edges removed based on size, but there is no mechanism in place to ensure that the final components all have an even number of vertices.

To illustrate a specific case where the code fails to meet the requirements:
- For a tree with 3 vertices, the edges can be represented as follows: `1 -- 2`, `1 -- 3`. According to the problem description, it is impossible to remove edges in such a way that all components have an even number of vertices. The expected output should be `-1`, but there is no logic in the code to arrive at this conclusion correctly.

Thus, the code does not adequately handle the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
