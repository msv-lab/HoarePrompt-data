Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. Here are the reasons why it fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Understanding of the Problem**: The task is to determine how many edges can be removed from a tree such that all resulting connected components have an even number of vertices. This requires a comprehensive strategy to assess the sizes of the components after potential edge removals.

2. **Functionality of `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - The `func_1` function appears to be attempting to traverse nodes in the tree, but it does not utilize the edges (connections) properly, and it uses a deque without establishing a correct connection representation for the tree.
   - The `func_2` function seems to be intended for computing the size of subtrees. However, it does not return the number of removable edges or check if the sizes of all connected components can be made even.

3. **Missing Logic for Edge Removal**: The program lacks logic to determine how many edges can be removed based on the sizes of the resulting components. Specifically:
   - After calculating the sizes of the subtrees, the program should check if each subtree has an even size. If a subtree rooted at a child node is odd-sized, it cannot be removed while keeping the remaining components even-sized.
   - The final count of removable edges is not computed anywhere in the provided functions.

4. **Return Value**: The program does not return the maximum number of edges that can be removed, nor does it return -1 when it is impossible to satisfy the problemâ€™s requirements.

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary logic for determining the sizes of components after edge removals and does not follow the problem's requirements. Thus, it does not solve the problem correctly.
