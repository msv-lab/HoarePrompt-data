The variable `sz[node]` is assigned the value `1`, indicating that the size of the subtree rooted at the node is initialized to 1. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but since `sz` is being indexed by `node`, it is implied that `node` has a defined value corresponding to an index in `sz`. Other variables (`n` and `seen`) are not affected by this specific assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `node` is printed and added to `seen`, and `sz[node]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `node` is printed and added to `seen`, `sz[node]` is 1**
