Postcondition: ***`a` is assigned the value of the first element from `Q`, `Q` is modified to exclude the first element, `seen` includes `a`, and `cnt` is increased by the number of elements in `E[a]`. If `a` is already in `seen`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop without any additional changes.***
