The code `seen.add(node)` adds the value of `node` to the set `seen`. The initial state specifies that `node` is printed and that `node` is not in `seen`, implying that `node` is a new entry. Therefore, after execution, `node` will be added to `seen`, and the other variable `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `node` is printed and added to `seen`.**
