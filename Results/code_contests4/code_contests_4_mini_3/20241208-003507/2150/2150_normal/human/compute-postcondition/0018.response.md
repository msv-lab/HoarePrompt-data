Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `node` representing a vertex in a tree and returns 0 if `node` has been visited previously (indicating it is a leaf in the context of the function's execution); otherwise, it returns the size of the subtree rooted at `node`, calculated as 1 plus the sum of the sizes of all its neighboring nodes in `E[node]`. The function uses a global `seen` set to track visited nodes to prevent counting them multiple times. **
