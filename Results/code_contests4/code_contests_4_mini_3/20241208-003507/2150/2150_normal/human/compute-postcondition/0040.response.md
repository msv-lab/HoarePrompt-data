The code `Q.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the list `Q`. The previous values indicate that `b` is the second element in `E[a]`, and `Q` already contains `a` as its first element. The states of the other variables, `seen` and `cnt`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first element from `Q`, `seen` contains `a`, `cnt` is increased by the number of elements in `E[a]` plus 1, `b` is the second element in `E[a]`, and `b` is now appended to `Q`.

Output State: **`a` is the first element from `Q`, `seen` contains `a`, `cnt` is increased by the number of elements in `E[a]` plus 1, `b` is the second element in `E[a]`, and `b` is now appended to `Q`.**
