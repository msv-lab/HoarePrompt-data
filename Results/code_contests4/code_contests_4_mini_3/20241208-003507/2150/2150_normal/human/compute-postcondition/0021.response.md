Postcondition: ***`a` is the integer removed from the front of `Q`, `Q` now contains all elements of `E[a]` that were appended during the iterations minus the removed element, `seen` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is increased by the number of edges in `E[a]`. If `a` is in `seen`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
