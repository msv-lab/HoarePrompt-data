According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `E[a]`. If `E[a]` contains at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is assigned the value of the first element from `Q`, and `seen` includes `a`. The variable `cnt` is increased based on the number of elements in `E[a]`, which implies that `E[a]` must have elements for `cnt` to increase, indicating that `E[a]` should not be empty. 

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, `E[a]` must contain at least one element. Since `b` will take the first value from `E[a]` when the loop starts, `b` will be the first element of `E[a]`.

State: **`a` is the first element from `Q`, `seen` contains `a`, `cnt` is increased by the number of elements in `E[a]` plus 1, for the loop to execute the first time `E[a]` must contain at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in `E[a]`**
