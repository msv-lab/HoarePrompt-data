The `continue` statement does not change any variable values directly but is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the integer removed from the front of `Q`, `Q` now contains all elements of `E[a]` that were appended during the iterations minus the removed element, `seen` remains unchanged, `cnt` is increased by the number of edges in `E[a]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
