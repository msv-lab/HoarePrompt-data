The value of `sz[node]` is updated by adding the result of `func_2(neigh)` to it. The variable `neigh` is printed at `current_index + 1`, but we don't have specific values for `neigh`, `current_index`, or what `func_2(neigh)` returns. Therefore, the output state indicates that `sz[node]` will be modified, but we cannot specify the exact value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz[node]` is updated; `E[node]` must have at least one more neighbor beyond the current index; `neigh` at `current_index + 1` is printed.**
