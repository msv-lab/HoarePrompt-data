According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `E[a]`. If `E[a]` has more elements, the loop can execute again for the next element in `E[a]`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the second element in `E[a]`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `E[a]` must have at least three elements. After the current iteration, `b` will be updated to the third element in `E[a]`.

State: **`a` is the first element from `Q`, `seen` contains `a`, `cnt` is increased by the number of elements in `E[a]` plus 1, `b` is the third element in `E[a]`, for the loop to execute a second time `E[a]` must have at least 3 elements.**
