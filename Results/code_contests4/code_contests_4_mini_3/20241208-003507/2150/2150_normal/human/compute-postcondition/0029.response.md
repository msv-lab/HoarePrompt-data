The value of `b` is appended to the list `Q`, and since `b` is the third element of `E[a]`, it has a specific value based on the current state of `E[a]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `Q` includes `b` as its last element, `seen` includes `a`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `b` is the third element of `E[a]`, and `E[a]` has at least 3 elements.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `Q` includes `b` as its last element, `seen` includes `a`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `b` is the third element of `E[a]`, and `E[a]` has at least 3 elements.**
