The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` is an integer representing a vertex in a tree with `n` vertices, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. After executing the function body, if `node` has no neighbors (i.e., it is a leaf node), the function returns 0. If `node` has neighbors, the function returns the size of the subtree rooted at `node`, which is equal to 1 plus the sum of the sizes of all its neighboring nodes in the tree structure. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `node` and return the size of the subtree rooted at that node, or 0 if the node is a leaf. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node and returns 0 if node is a leaf; otherwise, it returns the size of the subtree rooted at node, which is calculated as 1 plus the sum of the sizes of all its neighboring nodes.**
