According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `E[node]`. If `E[node]` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next neighbor. At the end of the last iteration, `sz[node]` has been incremented by the return value of `func_2(neigh)` for the current neighbor. Since we are in a for loop iterating over `E[node]`, we need to identify the next neighbor to process.

If we denote the current index of the iteration as `current_index`, the next iteration will process the neighbor at `current_index + 1`. The loop will continue executing until all neighbors in `E[node]` have been processed.

Therefore, if `E[node]` has more neighbors beyond the current index, the next state will indicate that we are now at the next index and processing the corresponding neighbor.

State: **`sz[node]` is updated, for the loop to execute again `E[node]` must have at least one more neighbor beyond the current index, and the next neighbor to process is `neigh` at `current_index + 1`.**
