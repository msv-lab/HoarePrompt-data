Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `node` is printed and added to `seen`; `sz[node]` is incremented by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`; for the loop to execute one more time, `E[node]` must have at least 2 neighbors, and `neigh` is the next neighbor in `E[node]`; `neigh` is printed.**
