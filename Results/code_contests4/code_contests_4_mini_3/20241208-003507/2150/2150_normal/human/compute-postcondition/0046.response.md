The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. The parameter `a` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, constrained between 1 and 100,000. The parameter `b` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) contains two integers representing the edges of the tree, with the constraints that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the length of `b` is n - 1. After executing the function, it returns the number of unique elements processed from Q, which is equal to `cnt`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `a` representing the number of vertices and a list of tuples `b` representing the edges of the tree, and it returns the count of unique elements processed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of vertices and a list of tuples `b` representing the edges of the tree, returning the count of unique elements processed.**
