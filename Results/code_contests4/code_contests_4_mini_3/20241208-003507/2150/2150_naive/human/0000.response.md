To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The program must determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed from a tree such that all remaining connected components have an even number of vertices. If the total number of vertices \( n \) is odd, it's impossible to achieve this, and the program should return -1.

2. **Initial Check for Odd Vertices**: The program correctly checks if \( n \) is odd at the beginning and returns -1 if so. This is correct behavior according to the description.

3. **Building the Tree**: The program constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree using the input edges, which is appropriate.

4. **Calculating Subtree Sizes**: The program defines a recursive function `func_2` that calculates the size of the subtree for each node. It marks nodes as seen to avoid counting them multiple times. This logic is sound.

5. **Counting Possible Cuts**: The program iterates through each edge and checks the minimum size of the subtrees formed by that edge. If the minimum size is even, it counts that edge as a potential cut. This is also in line with the requirement.

6. **Final Output**: The program outputs the count of edges that can be removed, which is expected.

Now, let's identify potential edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail:

- **Edge Case with a Single Edge**: If \( n = 2 \) (the smallest tree), the program should correctly output 0 since there are no components left after cutting the only edge.

- **General Case**: For any tree with an even number of vertices, if all edges can potentially be removed without leaving any odd-sized components, the program should accurately count and return these edges.

- **Complex Structures**: We can also consider more complex tree structures, such as those that are skewed or balanced. 

Now, let's verify:

- The program does not handle the case where a tree could have multiple edges leading to the same node incorrectly, as it does not check for cycles, but since it's a tree, this is inherently valid.

- The counting mechanism in the `func_2` function seems appropriate for calculating subtree sizes.

After analyzing the logic and structure of the program, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles the input/output as expected. There are no identified cases where it fails to meet the requirements.
