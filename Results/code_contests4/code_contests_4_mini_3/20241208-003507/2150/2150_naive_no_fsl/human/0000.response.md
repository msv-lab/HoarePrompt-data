To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the specified problem description, let's analyze the logic and check it against potential edge cases:

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. We need to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed from a tree such that all remaining connected components have an even number of vertices.
2. If the total number of vertices `n` is odd, it's impossible to split into even components, and the output should be -1.
3. If the total number of vertices `n` is even, we need to count how many edges can be removed while ensuring all resulting components remain even.

### Code Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the number of vertices `n` and edges, and it constructs an adjacency list `E` for the tree.
- If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints -1 and exits.
- The program defines a recursive function `func_2` to calculate the size of connected components starting from a root node (a leaf node in this case).
- It then iterates through the edges and counts how many can be removed, based on the sizes of the connected components formed by the edges.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Single Node Tree**: If `n = 1`, the program does not handle this explicitly. It should return -1 since a single node cannot form an even-sized component.
2. **Two Node Tree**: If `n = 2`, the program should return 0, which it does correctly.
3. **Even Size Tree with All Edges Removable**: For an even-sized tree where every edge can be removed, the program should correctly count these edges.
4. **Tree with Unbalanced Structures**: It is important to ensure that the program can handle trees that are unbalanced and still compute the sizes correctly.

#### Example of a Failing Test Case:
- For a tree with just one vertex:
    ```
    Input:
    1
    ```
    The expected output is -1 (since you cannot have even-sized components), but the program does not explicitly handle this case.

Thus, since there is at least one input case (n = 1) for which the program does not adhere to the problem specification, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n = 1` correctly, which should yield -1.
