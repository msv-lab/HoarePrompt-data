Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the cumulative weight of the packages exceeds the maximum load `P` during the loading process. 

### Potential Failure Case:
Consider the following input:
```
5 2
5
5
5
5
5
```
In this case, the packages have a weight of 5 kg each, and there are 5 packages with 2 trucks available. The minimum value of the maximum load `P` should be 10 kg (each truck can carry two packages of 5 kg). However, the program will incorrectly count the trucks needed because it does not reset the `loadings` variable correctly when a truck reaches its maximum load.

Specifically, when the cumulative weight exceeds a potential `P`, the program incorrectly increments the truck count and does not handle the weight distribution properly, which could lead to an incorrect result or infinite loop under certain conditions. As a result, it may fail to find the correct minimum `P` for various inputs.

Thus, due to this logic flaw, the program is incorrect.
