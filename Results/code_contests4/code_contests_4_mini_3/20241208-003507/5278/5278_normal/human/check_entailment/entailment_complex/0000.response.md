Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` (the number of packages) and `k` (the number of trucks) from input, followed by `n` weight values. This aligns with the input specifications given in the problem.

2. **Special Cases**:
   - If there is only one truck (`k == 1`), the program correctly sets the minimum required capacity `minP` to the sum of all package weights (`sumW`), which is accurate as all packages must be loaded onto one truck.
   - If the number of packages equals the number of trucks (`n == k`), the program correctly sets `minP` to the maximum weight of any single package (`maxW`), as each truck can carry only one package without exceeding its capacity.

3. **Binary Search for Minimum Capacity**: 
   - For cases where `n` is greater than `k`, the program uses a binary search approach to find the minimum truck capacity `P`. 
   - It initializes the search bounds correctly: `left` starts at `maxW` (the minimum possible truck capacity) and `right` is set to a large upper limit (the maximum possible total weight).
   - The inner loop correctly counts how many trucks are needed for a given capacity `middle`. If the accumulated weight exceeds `middle`, it increments the truck counter and resets the load to the current package weight, ensuring that the packages are loaded consecutively.
   - The conditions for adjusting the binary search bounds (`left` and `right`) are correctly implemented based on whether the number of trucks used exceeds `k` or not.

4. **Final Result**: 
   - After the binary search concludes, the program correctly identifies the minimum truck capacity that allows all packages to be loaded within the constraints given.

5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm is efficient with a time complexity roughly O(n log(S)), where `S` is the range of possible values for `P`, making it suitable for the problem's constraints.

Overall, the program effectively and correctly follows the problem description, ensuring it handles all specified cases and constraints. Thus, it meets the requirements as outlined, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
