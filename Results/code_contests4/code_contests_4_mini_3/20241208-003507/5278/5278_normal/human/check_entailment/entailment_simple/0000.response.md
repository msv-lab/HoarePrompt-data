To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and ensure it aligns with the requirements of loading packages onto trucks while minimizing the maximum load capacity \( P \).

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers \( n \) (number of packages) and \( k \) (number of trucks).
   - It then reads \( n \) weights of the packages.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `maxW` to keep track of the maximum weight of a single package and `sumW` to compute the total weight of all packages.

3. **Finding Initial Values**:
   - The program correctly calculates `maxW` and `sumW` by iterating through the weights.

4. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - If there is only one truck (`k == 1`), it directly sets `minP` to `sumW` (since all packages must be loaded onto one truck).
   - If the number of trucks is equal to the number of packages (`n == k`), it sets `minP` to `maxW` (since each package would go into its own truck).

5. **Binary Search for Minimum Maximum Load**:
   - For cases where \( n \neq k \) and \( k > 1 \), the program employs a binary search to find the minimum possible value of \( P \) that allows the packages to be loaded onto the trucks without exceeding the capacity.
   - It defines a range for \( P \) starting from `maxW` to a reasonable upper bound based on the weights.
   - Inside the binary search, it counts how many trucks would be needed for a given value of \( middle \) (potential value of \( P \)).
   - If the number of trucks exceeds \( k \), it adjusts the search range accordingly.

### Justification of Correctness

- **Coverage of All Cases**:
  - The program effectively handles edge cases for \( k = 1 \) and \( n = k \).
  - The binary search ensures that it finds the minimal value of \( P \) such that all packages can be loaded within the constraints of \( k \) trucks.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program operates efficiently within the problem's constraints (up to 100,000 packages and trucks), utilizing binary search to minimize the number of checks needed to find the appropriate load capacity.

- **Conformance to Problem Description**:
  - The algorithm adheres to the requirement to load consecutive packages while ensuring the maximum load does not exceed \( P \).
  - It correctly reports the minimum value of \( P \) needed to load all the packages.

Given the thorough analysis and the program's adherence to the specifications outlined in the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
