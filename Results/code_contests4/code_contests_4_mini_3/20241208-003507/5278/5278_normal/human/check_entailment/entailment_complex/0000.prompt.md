You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given $n$ packages of $w_i$ kg from a belt conveyor in order ($i = 0, 1, ... n-1$). You should load all packages onto $k$ trucks which have the common maximum load $P$. Each truck can load consecutive packages (more than or equals to zero) from the belt conveyor unless the total weights of the packages in the sequence does not exceed the maximum load $P$.

Write a program which reads $n$, $k$ and $w_i$, and reports the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor.

Constraints

* $1 \leq n \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq k \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq w_i \leq 10,000$

Input

In the first line, two integers $n$ and $k$ are given separated by a space character. In the following $n$ lines, $w_i$ are given respectively.

Output

Print the minimum value of $P$ in a line.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100,000), k is a positive integer (1 <= k <= 100,000), and w_i are positive integers (1 <= w_i <= 10,000) representing the weights of n packages.
def func():
    n, k = [int(val) for val in raw_input().split(' ')]
    w = []
    maxW = sumW = 0
    for i in range(n):
        num = int(raw_input())
        
        sumW += num
        
        w.append(num)
        
        if maxW < num:
            maxW = num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`.
    minP = 0
    if (1 == k) :
        minP = sumW
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            minP = maxW
        else :
            left = maxW
            right = 100000 * 10000
            while left <= right:
                middle = (left + right) // 2
                
                truckCnt = i = loadings = 0
                
                while i < n:
                    loadings += w[i]
                    if middle < loadings:
                        truckCnt += 1
                        if k < truckCnt + 1:
                            break
                        loadings = w[i]
                    i += 1
                
                if truckCnt + 1 <= k:
                    minP = middle
                
                if k < truckCnt + 1:
                    left = middle + 1
                else:
                    right = middle - 1
                
            #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `left` is greater than `right`, `minP` is the minimum value that allows the loading of `n` integers in at most `k` trucks, `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks counted based on the last evaluated `middle`, `loadings` is the value accumulated in the last truck before the loop terminated, `i` is `n` or less than `n` based on the final loading evaluation.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, and `minP` is equal to `maxW`. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then `minP` is the minimum value that allows the loading of `n` integers in at most `k` trucks, `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks counted based on the last evaluated `middle`, `loadings` is the value accumulated in the last truck before the loop terminated, and `i` is `n` or less than `n` based on the final loading evaluation.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer. If `k` is equal to 1, then `minP` is equal to `sumW`, the sum of all integers in `w`. If `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is equal to `k`, then `minP` is equal to `maxW`, the maximum value among the integers in `w`. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then `minP` is the minimum value that allows the loading of `n` integers in at most `k` trucks, with `truckCnt` representing the total number of trucks counted, `loadings` being the value accumulated in the last truck, and `i` being `n` or less than `n` based on the final loading evaluation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (the number of packages) and `k` (the maximum number of trucks), followed by `n` positive integers representing the weights of the packages. It calculates the minimum weight capacity required for `k` trucks to transport all `n` packages. If there is only one truck (`k` is 1), the capacity is the sum of all weights. If the number of packages equals the number of trucks (`n` equals `k`), the capacity is the maximum weight of a single package. Otherwise, it uses a binary search approach to determine the minimum truck capacity that allows loading all packages without exceeding `k` trucks. The function does not return any explicit output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
