Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is 0, `left` is `maxW`, `right` is 1000000000, `middle` is `(maxW + 1000000000) // 2`, `truckCnt` is increased to 2, `i` is 2, `loadings` is updated to `loadings + w[i]` if `middle` is less than `loadings`.**
