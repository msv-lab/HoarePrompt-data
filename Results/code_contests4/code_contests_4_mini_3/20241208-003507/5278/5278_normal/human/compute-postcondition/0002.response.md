The code initializes the variables `maxW` and `sumW` to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `w` remain unchanged from their initial state, and no other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 <= k <= 100,000), `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0**
