The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, where `n` represents the number of packages and must be between 1 and 100,000, and `k` represents a threshold value, which also must be between 1 and 100,000. Additionally, the function accepts a list of positive integers `w_i`, where each `w_i` represents the weight of the `n` packages and must be between 1 and 10,000.

The output of the function is not described in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot specify the exact return value or the conditions under which different outputs may occur.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of packages), k (threshold value), and w_i (weights of the packages), with the constraints that n and k are positive integers within specific ranges, and w_i are positive integers representing the weights of the packages. The specific output of the function is not provided.**
