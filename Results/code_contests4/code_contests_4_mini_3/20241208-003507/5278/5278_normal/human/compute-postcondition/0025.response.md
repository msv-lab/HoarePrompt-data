`minP` is assigned the value of `sumW`. The value of `sumW` was previously calculated as the sum of all integers in `w`, and `minP` is now equal to this sum. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and equal to 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is equal to `sumW`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and equal to 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is equal to `sumW.**
