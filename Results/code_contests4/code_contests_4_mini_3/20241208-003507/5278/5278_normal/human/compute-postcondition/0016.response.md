According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num` and also includes the appended value `num`, `maxW` is less than `num` and set to `num`, `sumW` remains `2 * num`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
