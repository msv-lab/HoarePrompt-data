The value of `loadings` is updated by adding `w[i]` to it. The previous value of `loadings` is `w[0]`, and since `i` is already increased by 1, the new value of `loadings` will be `w[0] + w[i]`. The values of `truckCnt` and `middle` remain unchanged, and the loop condition regarding `n` and `i` still applies. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is `w[0] + w[i]`, `truckCnt` is unchanged, `middle` is unchanged, and `i` is still subject to the loop condition with respect to `n`.

Output State: **`loadings` is `w[0] + w[i]`, `truckCnt` is unchanged, `middle` is unchanged, and `i` is still subject to the loop condition with respect to `n`.**
