The variable `minP` is assigned the value of `maxW`. Since `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, after execution, `minP` will hold this maximum value, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is equal to `maxW`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is equal to `maxW**
