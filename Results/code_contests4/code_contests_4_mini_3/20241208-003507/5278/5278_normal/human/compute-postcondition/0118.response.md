The variable `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `loadings` will now be equal to `w[0]`. The values of the other variables (`middle`, `truckCnt`, and `k`) are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `loadings` is `w[0]`; `middle` is less than `loadings`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1; if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
