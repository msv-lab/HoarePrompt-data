`truckCnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `truckCnt` has been increased by 1 while the values of `loadings`, `middle`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is `w[0] + w[i]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `middle` is unchanged, and `i` is still subject to the loop condition with respect to `n`.
Output State: **`loadings` is `w[0] + w[i]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `middle` is unchanged, and `i` is still subject to the loop condition with respect to `n`.**
