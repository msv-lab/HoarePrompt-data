Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is set to `(maxW + 1000000000) // 2`, `left` is `maxW`, `right` is 1000000000, `middle` is `(maxW + 1000000000) // 2`, `truckCnt` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `n`, and `loadings` is the total loading amount of the last truck that was filled. The count of trucks `truckCnt` is less than or equal to `k - 1`, meaning that `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`.***
