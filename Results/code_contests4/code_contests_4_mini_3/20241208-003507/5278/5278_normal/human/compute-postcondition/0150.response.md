Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (the number of packages) and `k` (the maximum number of trucks), followed by `n` positive integers representing the weights of the packages. It calculates the minimum weight capacity required for `k` trucks to transport all `n` packages. If there is only one truck (`k` is 1), the capacity is the sum of all weights. If the number of packages equals the number of trucks (`n` equals `k`), the capacity is the maximum weight of a single package. Otherwise, it uses a binary search approach to determine the minimum truck capacity that allows loading all packages without exceeding `k` trucks. The function does not return any explicit output. **
