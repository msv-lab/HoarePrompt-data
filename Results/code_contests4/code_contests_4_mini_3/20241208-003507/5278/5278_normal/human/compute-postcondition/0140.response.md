Postcondition: ***`i` is `n` or less than `n`, `loadings` is the last value of `w[i]` after the last valid addition or reset, `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks counted, and `middle` remains unchanged. If `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, then `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`.***
