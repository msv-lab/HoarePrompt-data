The variable `num` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input (a string) and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables, such as `n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`, `sumW`, and `i`, remain unchanged. Since `num` is expected to be a positive integer, it will impact the flow of the program later based on its value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is less than `num`, `sumW` is `num`, `i` is 1, and `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is less than `num`, `sumW` is `num`, `i` is 1, and `num` is an input integer.**
