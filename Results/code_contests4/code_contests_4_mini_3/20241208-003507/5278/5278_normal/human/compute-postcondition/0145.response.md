Postcondition: ***`i` is `n` or less than `n`, `loadings` is the last value of `w[i]` after the last valid addition or reset, `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks counted, `middle` remains unchanged; if `k` is less than or equal to `truckCnt + 1`, then `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`. Otherwise, `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`.***
