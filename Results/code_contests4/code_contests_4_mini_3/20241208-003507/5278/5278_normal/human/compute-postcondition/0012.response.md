`sumW` is assigned the value of `sumW + num`. Since `sumW` is currently `num`, the new value of `sumW` becomes `num + num`, which is `2 * num`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is less than `num`, `sumW` is `2 * num`, `i` is 1, and `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is less than `num`, `sumW` is `2 * num`, `i` is 1, and `num` is an input integer.**
