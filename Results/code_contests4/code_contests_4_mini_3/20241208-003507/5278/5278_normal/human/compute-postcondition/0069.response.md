Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is set to `(maxW + 1000000000) // 2`, `truckCnt` can be incremented by 1 only if `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. If it is not possible to increment `truckCnt`, then `left` is updated to `middle + 1`, while `right` remains 1000000000, and `truckCnt` remains greater than or equal to `k`. If the increment is possible, `left` is set to `maxW`, while `right` is updated to `middle - 1`, where `middle` is `(maxW + 1000000000) // 2`, and `loadings` continues to represent the total loading amount of the last truck that was filled.***
