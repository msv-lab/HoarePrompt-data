According to the code, the loop can execute if the condition `left <= right` holds true. In the current state, `left` is equal to `maxW`, which is a positive integer, and `right` is set to 1000000000. Since `maxW` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to 1000000000, the condition for the loop to execute the first time is satisfied. 

However, the current state of `n` being not equal to `k` does not affect the loop execution directly, as the loop condition relies solely on `left` and `right`. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is 0, `left` is `maxW`, `right` is 1000000000, and `n` is not equal to `k`**
