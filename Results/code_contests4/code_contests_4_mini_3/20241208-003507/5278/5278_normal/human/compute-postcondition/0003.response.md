According to the code, the for loop will execute `n` times, where `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The variables `k`, `w`, `maxW`, and `sumW` do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the initialization of `i`, which will be 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0**
