According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `n` is not specified. For the loop to execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted so that it is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 0**
