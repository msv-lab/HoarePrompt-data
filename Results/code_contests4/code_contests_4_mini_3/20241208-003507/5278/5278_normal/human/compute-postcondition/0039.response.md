Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is 0, `left` is `maxW`, `right` is 1000000000, `middle` is `(maxW + 1000000000) // 2`, `truckCnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `loadings` is `w[0]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1` (which means `k` is less than 2).***
