Postcondition: ***If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `i` is increased by 1, `loadings` is increased by `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not less than `truckCnt + 1`, then no changes are made to `i`, `loadings`, or `truckCnt`.***
