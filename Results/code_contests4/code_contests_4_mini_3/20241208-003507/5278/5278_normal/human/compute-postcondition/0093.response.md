The value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `truckCnt` is unknown, so it simply increases by 1. The values of `i` and `loadings` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `loadings` is increased by `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `loadings` is increased by `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.**
