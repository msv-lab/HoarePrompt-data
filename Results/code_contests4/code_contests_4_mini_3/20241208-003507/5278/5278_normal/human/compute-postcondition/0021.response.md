Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num` and also includes the appended value `num`. If `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is set to `num`, `sumW` is now `2 * num + num`, and `i` is 2, with `num` assigned the value of the input from `raw_input()`.***
