The variable `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. The previous value of `loadings` was `w[0] + w[i]`, but now it will only reflect `w[i]`. The other variables, `truckCnt`, `middle`, and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is `w[i]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `middle` is unchanged, and `i` is still subject to the loop condition with respect to `n`.

Output State: **`loadings` is `w[i]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `middle` is unchanged, and `i` is still subject to the loop condition with respect to `n`.**
