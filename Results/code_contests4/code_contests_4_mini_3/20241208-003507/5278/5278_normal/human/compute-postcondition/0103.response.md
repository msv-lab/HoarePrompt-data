Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the load based on the maximum allowed load `middle`, `loadings` is the last value of `w[i]` before the loop terminated. The value of `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, indicating that `truckCnt` exceeds `k`. `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`, and `truckCnt` does not exceed `k`.***
