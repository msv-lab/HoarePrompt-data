Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, and `minP` is equal to `maxW`. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then `minP` is the minimum value that allows the loading of `n` integers in at most `k` trucks, `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks counted based on the last evaluated `middle`, `loadings` is the value accumulated in the last truck before the loop terminated, and `i` is `n` or less than `n` based on the final loading evaluation.***
