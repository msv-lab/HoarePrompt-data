Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the load based on the maximum allowed load `middle`, `loadings` is the last value of `w[i]` before the loop terminated, if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `minP` is assigned the value of `middle` and `left` is now `middle + 1`. Otherwise, if `truckCnt + 1` is larger than `k`, `minP` is not assigned the value of `middle` and `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`, while `truckCnt` does not exceed `k`.***
