The variable `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. The previous value of `i` is 1, so `loadings` will now hold the value of `w[1]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is 0, `left` is `maxW`, `right` is 1000000000, `middle` is `(maxW + 1000000000) // 2`, `truckCnt` is 2, `i` is 1, `loadings` is `w[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is 0, `left` is `maxW`, `right` is 1000000000, `middle` is `(maxW + 1000000000) // 2`, `truckCnt` is 2, `i` is 1, `loadings` is `w[1]`**.
