The value of `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. The previous value of `loadings` was `w[0] + 2 * w[i]`, but it is now being replaced with `w[i]`. The variable `truckCnt` has already been increased by 1, `middle` remains unchanged, and since `n` is greater than `i`, the loop will execute again. Additionally, since `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state is: `loadings` is now `w[i]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `middle` is unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`loadings` is now `w[i]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `middle` is unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
