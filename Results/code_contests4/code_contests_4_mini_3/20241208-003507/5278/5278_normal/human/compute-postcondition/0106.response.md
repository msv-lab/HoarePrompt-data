Output State: **`i` is `n`, `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the load based on the maximum allowed load `middle`, `loadings` is the last value of `w[i]` before the loop terminated, `truckCnt + 1` is larger than `k`, and `minP` is not assigned the value of `middle` while `truckCnt` does not exceed `k`; `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`.**
