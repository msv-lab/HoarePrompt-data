The code `left = middle + 1` assigns the value of `middle + 1` to `left`. The variable `middle` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that it has a value. The state of the other variables is not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the load based on the maximum allowed load `middle`, `loadings` is the last value of `w[i]` before the loop terminated, `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`, `truckCnt` does not exceed `k`, and `left` is now `middle + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the load based on the maximum allowed load `middle`, `loadings` is the last value of `w[i]` before the loop terminated, `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`, `truckCnt` does not exceed `k`, `left` is now `middle + 1`.**
