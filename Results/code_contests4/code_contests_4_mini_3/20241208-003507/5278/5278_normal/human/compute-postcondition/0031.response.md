The variable `right` is assigned the value `100000 * 10000`, which is calculated as `1000000000`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed or impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is 0, `left` is `maxW`, `right` is 1000000000, and `n` is not equal to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is 0, `left` is `maxW`, `right` is 1000000000, and `n` is not equal to `k`.**
