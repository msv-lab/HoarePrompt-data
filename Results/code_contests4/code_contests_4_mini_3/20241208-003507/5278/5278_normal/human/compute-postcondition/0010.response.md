According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, since `n` is a positive integer, it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again when `i` is 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is less than `num`, `sumW` is `num`, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
