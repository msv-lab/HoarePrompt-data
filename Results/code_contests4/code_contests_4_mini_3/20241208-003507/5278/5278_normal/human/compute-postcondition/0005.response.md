The variable `sumW` is incremented by the value of `num`. The previous value of `sumW` is 0, so after the execution, `sumW` will be equal to `num`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is `num`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is `num`, `i` is 0**
