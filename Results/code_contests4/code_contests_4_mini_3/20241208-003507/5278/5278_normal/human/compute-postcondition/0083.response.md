According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was increased by 1, meaning it is currently equal to its previous value plus one. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, which implies that `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`. 

Since `i` is reset to 0 and then increased by 1, it is currently 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. Other states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again, `n` is greater than 1**
