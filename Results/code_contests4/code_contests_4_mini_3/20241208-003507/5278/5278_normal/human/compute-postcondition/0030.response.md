The variable `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`. The previous value of `maxW` is known to be the maximum value among the integers in `w`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `w`, `sumW`, `minP`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `left`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `w` contains `n` integers, `maxW` is the maximum value among the integers in `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`, `minP` is 0, `left` is `maxW`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.**
