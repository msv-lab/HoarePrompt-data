The code `loadings += w[i]` adds the value of `w[i]` to `loadings`. Since `i` is 0, this means we are looking at the first element of the array `w`. 

However, without the values of `loadings` and `w`, we cannot specify their new values, only that `loadings` will be increased by the value of `w[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, and `loadings` is increased by `w[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `loadings` is increased by `w[0]**
