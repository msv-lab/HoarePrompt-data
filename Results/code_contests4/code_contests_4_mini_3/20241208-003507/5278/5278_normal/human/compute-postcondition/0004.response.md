The variable `num` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input from the user and `int()` converts that input to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`, `sumW`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0, and `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer**
