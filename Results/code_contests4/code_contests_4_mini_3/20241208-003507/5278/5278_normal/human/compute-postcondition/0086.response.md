The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop since the `break` statement is executed. The conditions for the loop to execute again are still applicable, but we exit the loop at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again, `n` is greater than 1; `loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
