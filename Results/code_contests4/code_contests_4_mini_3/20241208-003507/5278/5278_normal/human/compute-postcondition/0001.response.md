The code snippet initializes an empty list `w`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `w` while maintaining the values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 <= k <= 100,000), `w` is an empty list**
