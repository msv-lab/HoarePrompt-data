The value of `maxW` is assigned the value of `num`. Since `maxW` was previously less than `num`, it is now set to the value of `num`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num` and also includes the appended value `num`, `maxW` is now equal to `num`, `sumW` is now `2 * num + num`, `i` is 2, and `num` is the input value.
