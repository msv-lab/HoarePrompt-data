The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `loadings` is increased by `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `loadings` is increased by `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
