The code `w.append(num)` adds the value of `num` to the list `w`. The initial state indicates that `w` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `w` will contain one element, which is `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is `num`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is `num`, `i` is 0**
