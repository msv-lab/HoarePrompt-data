The variable `maxW` is assigned the value of `num`. The previous value of `maxW` was 0, and now it will be updated to the value of `num`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `w`, `sumW`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is `num`, `sumW` is `num`, `i` is 0, and `maxW` is less than `num`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num`, `maxW` is `num`, `sumW` is `num`, `i` is 0, and `maxW` is less than `num`**
