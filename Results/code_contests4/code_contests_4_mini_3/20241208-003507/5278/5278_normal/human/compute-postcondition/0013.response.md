The value of `num` is appended to the list `w`, which will increase the length of `w` by one and add `num` as its last element. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `maxW`, `sumW`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated list `w` with the new value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `w` contains `num` and also includes the appended value `num`, `maxW` is less than `num`, `sumW` is `2 * num`, `i` is 1, and `num` is an input integer**.
