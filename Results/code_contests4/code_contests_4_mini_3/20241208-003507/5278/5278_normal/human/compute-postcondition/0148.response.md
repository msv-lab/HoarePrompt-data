Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer. If `k` is equal to 1, then `minP` is equal to `sumW`, the sum of all integers in `w`. If `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is equal to `k`, then `minP` is equal to `maxW`, the maximum value among the integers in `w`. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then `minP` is the minimum value that allows the loading of `n` integers in at most `k` trucks, with `truckCnt` representing the total number of trucks counted, `loadings` being the value accumulated in the last truck, and `i` being `n` or less than `n` based on the final loading evaluation.***
