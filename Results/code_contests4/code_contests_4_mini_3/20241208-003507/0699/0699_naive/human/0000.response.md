To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and see if it adheres to the requirements for calculating the minimum and maximum beauty of an array after performing the specified operations.

1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - We're given an array `a` and an integer `x`.
   - We can replace two adjacent elements with their sum, which reduces the size of the array.
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the ceiling of each element divided by `x`.
   - We need to find both the minimum and maximum beauty possible after performing any operations.

2. **Analyzing the program**:
   - The program calculates `mx`, which is the maximum beauty, correctly by summing up the ceiling of each element divided by `x`.
   - The program attempts to calculate the minimum beauty by summing all elements of the array and dividing by `x` after reducing it to a single element sum. However, this is not the correct way to compute the minimum beauty.

3. **Finding potential issues**:
   - For the minimum beauty calculation, the program uses the total sum divided by `x`, which doesn't account for the necessary ceiling operations that would occur when summing adjacent elements.
   - This means that the calculated minimum beauty can be incorrect depending on the values in the array.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the case where `a = [1, 1, 1]` and `x = 2`.
     - The maximum beauty would be `3` (since each `1` contributes `1`).
     - The minimum beauty should be `2` (since combining them results in `3`, and `ceil(3/2) = 2`).
     - The program would incorrectly output `1` for the minimum beauty (since it computes `sum(a)/x = 3/2 = 1.5`, which rounds down to `1`).

Therefore, the program fails to correctly calculate the minimum beauty based on the rules described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.
