You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of length n, and an integer x. You can perform the following operation as many times as you would like (possibly zero): replace two adjacent elements of the array by their sum. For example, if the initial array was [3, 6, 9], in a single operation one can replace the last two elements by their sum, yielding an array [3, 15], or replace the first two elements to get an array [9, 9]. Note that the size of the array decreases after each operation.

The beauty of an array b=[b_1, …, b_k] is defined as ∑_{i=1}^k \left⌈ (b_i)/(x) \right⌉, which means that we divide each element by x, round it up to the nearest integer, and sum up the resulting values. For example, if x = 3, and the array is [4, 11, 6], the beauty of the array is equal to \left⌈ 4/3 \right⌉ + \left⌈ 11/3 \right⌉ + \left⌈ 6/3 \right⌉ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.

Please determine the minimum and the maximum beauty you can get by performing some operations on the original array.

Input

The first input line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the elements of the array a. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case output two integers — the minimal and the maximal possible beauty.

Example

Input


2
3 3
3 6 9
3 3
6 4 11


Output


6 6
7 8

Note

In the first test case the beauty of the array does not change if we perform any operations.

In the second example we can leave the array unchanged to attain the maximum beauty, and to get the minimum beauty one can replace two elements 4 and 11 with their sum, yielding an array [6, 15], which has its beauty equal to 7.
Program:
```
def func_1(n, x, a):
    x = float(x)
    mx = 0
    somme = reduce(lambda a, x: a + x, a, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        mx += math.ceil(a[i] / x)
    print('{} {}'.format(int(somme / x), int(mx)))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    lines = [map(int, line.split()) for line in sys.stdin.readlines()]
    lines.pop(0)
    while lines:
        n = lines[0][0]
        x = lines[0][1]
        a = lines[1]
        func_1(n, x, a)
        lines = lines[2:]
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
