You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an array a of length n, and an integer x. You can perform the following operation as many times as you would like (possibly zero): replace two adjacent elements of the array by their sum. For example, if the initial array was [3, 6, 9], in a single operation one can replace the last two elements by their sum, yielding an array [3, 15], or replace the first two elements to get an array [9, 9]. Note that the size of the array decreases after each operation.

The beauty of an array b=[b_1, …, b_k] is defined as ∑_{i=1}^k \left⌈ (b_i)/(x) \right⌉, which means that we divide each element by x, round it up to the nearest integer, and sum up the resulting values. For example, if x = 3, and the array is [4, 11, 6], the beauty of the array is equal to \left⌈ 4/3 \right⌉ + \left⌈ 11/3 \right⌉ + \left⌈ 6/3 \right⌉ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.

Please determine the minimum and the maximum beauty you can get by performing some operations on the original array.

Input

The first input line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the elements of the array a. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case output two integers — the minimal and the maximal possible beauty.

Example

Input


2
3 3
3 6 9
3 3
6 4 11


Output


6 6
7 8

Note

In the first test case the beauty of the array does not change if we perform any operations.

In the second example we can leave the array unchanged to attain the maximum beauty, and to get the minimum beauty one can replace two elements 4 and 11 with their sum, yielding an array [6, 15], which has its beauty equal to 7.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), x is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 1,000,000,000), and a is a list of integers where each element a_i satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000,000). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(n, x, a):
    x = float(x)
    mx = 0
    somme = reduce(lambda a, x: a + x, a, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        mx += math.ceil(a[i] / x)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `mx` is the sum of math.ceil(a[i] / x) for all i from 0 to n-1, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a positive float.
    print('{} {}'.format(int(somme / x), int(mx)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `x`, and a list of integers `a`. It calculates the total sum of the elements in `a` and the sum of the ceiling of each element in `a` divided by `x`. It then prints two values: the integer division of the total sum by `x` and the sum of the ceilings. The function does not explicitly return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
