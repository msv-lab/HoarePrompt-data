Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description for calculating both the minimum and maximum beauty of the array after performing the allowed operations. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Calculation of Maximum Beauty**: The program calculates the maximum beauty by summing the ceiling values of each element in the array divided by `x`. This is correct, as we do not need to perform any operations to maximize beauty; we can simply leave the array unchanged. However, the program does not explicitly return the maximum beauty correctly. It calculates `mx`, which is the desired maximum beauty but does not account for the sum of adjacent elements if operations were to be performed.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Beauty**: The program only computes the total sum of the elements in the array divided by `x` for the minimum beauty. The correct approach to find the minimum beauty would involve summing all elements and then applying the ceiling function, which is not done correctly here. The expression `int(somme / x)` does not correctly represent the minimum beauty, as it fails to account for the fact that the array could be summed into fewer elements through adjacent summation, which would give a different result.

3. **Missing Return Values**: The function only prints the results instead of returning them, which is not aligned with standard practices for functions that are expected to output results for further usage or evaluation.

In conclusion, the program fails to accurately compute the minimum beauty based on the allowed operations, and thus it does not fulfill the problem requirements as described.
