Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is incorrect:

1. **Understanding of Maximum Beauty**: The program calculates the maximum beauty by iterating through the array `a` and summing up the ceiling of each element divided by `x`. This is correct for calculating the maximum beauty as it represents the case when no operations are performed, and the original elements are kept intact.

2. **Understanding of Minimum Beauty**: The program attempts to calculate the minimum beauty by taking the sum of all elements in `a`, dividing this sum by `x`, and applying the ceiling function. However, this does not correctly represent the minimum beauty possible after performing the allowed operations (merging adjacent elements). The minimum beauty should be determined by considering how merging elements can affect the ceiling of their sum when divided by `x`.

   For example, if we have two elements `4` and `11`, merging them into `15` and then evaluating `⌈15/x⌉` could yield a different result than evaluating them separately. The program overlooks this aspect of the problem, thus failing to calculate the minimum beauty correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the results using `print()`, which is not necessarily aligned with the expected output format stated in the problem description. The expected output is to return two integers — the minimal and the maximal possible beauty for each test case, but the program does not return these values in a structured way, nor does it handle multiple test cases correctly.

Overall, the program does not compute the minimum beauty according to the rules of merging elements, and it lacks the necessary structure to handle multiple test cases properly. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description accurately.
