n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, x is a positive integer, and a is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. Additionally, the number of test cases t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
