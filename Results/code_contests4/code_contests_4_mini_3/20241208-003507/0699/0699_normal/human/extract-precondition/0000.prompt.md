You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given an array a of length n, and an integer x. You can perform the following operation as many times as you would like (possibly zero): replace two adjacent elements of the array by their sum. For example, if the initial array was [3, 6, 9], in a single operation one can replace the last two elements by their sum, yielding an array [3, 15], or replace the first two elements to get an array [9, 9]. Note that the size of the array decreases after each operation.

The beauty of an array b=[b_1, …, b_k] is defined as ∑_{i=1}^k \left⌈ (b_i)/(x) \right⌉, which means that we divide each element by x, round it up to the nearest integer, and sum up the resulting values. For example, if x = 3, and the array is [4, 11, 6], the beauty of the array is equal to \left⌈ 4/3 \right⌉ + \left⌈ 11/3 \right⌉ + \left⌈ 6/3 \right⌉ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.

Please determine the minimum and the maximum beauty you can get by performing some operations on the original array.

Input

The first input line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the elements of the array a. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case output two integers — the minimal and the maximal possible beauty.

Example

Input


2
3 3
3 6 9
3 3
6 4 11


Output


6 6
7 8

Note

In the first test case the beauty of the array does not change if we perform any operations.

In the second example we can leave the array unchanged to attain the maximum beauty, and to get the minimum beauty one can replace two elements 4 and 11 with their sum, yielding an array [6, 15], which has its beauty equal to 7.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(n, x, a):
```
