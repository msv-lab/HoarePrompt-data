According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 in the first iteration. The values of `x`, `a`, `mx`, and `somme` do not affect whether the loop will execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `i` is 0**
