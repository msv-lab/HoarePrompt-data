The code prints formatted output based on the values of `somme` and `mx`. `somme` is divided by `x`, and both are cast to integers for printing. The specific values of `somme` and `mx` are not provided, but they will affect the output.

The output state will reflect the calculations based on the variables involved:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `mx` is the sum of math.ceil(a[i] / x) for all i from 0 to n-1; the output is formatted as '{} {}'.format(int(somme / x), int(mx))**.
