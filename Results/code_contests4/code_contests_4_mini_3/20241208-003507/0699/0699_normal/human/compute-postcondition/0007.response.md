According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has executed once, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

Since `n` is a positive integer in the range from 1 to 100,000, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mx` is increased by `math.ceil(a[2] / x)` where `a[2]` is the value at index 2 of list `a` and `x` is a positive integer.**
