The variable `somme` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `a` using the `reduce` function with a lambda function that adds the elements together, starting from an initial value of `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `a` is a list of integers. Therefore, after execution, `somme` will hold the total sum of the integers in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `x` is a float, `a` is a list of integers, `mx` is 0, `somme` is the sum of all elements in `a`**.
