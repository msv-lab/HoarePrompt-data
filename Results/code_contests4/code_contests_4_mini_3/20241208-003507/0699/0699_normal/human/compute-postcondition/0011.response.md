The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `x` is a positive integer used as a threshold value.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` is also a positive integer.

After executing the function body, the output is determined based on the values of `n`, `x`, and the elements in the list `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `x`, and a list of integers `a`. It processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions involving `n`, `x`, and the elements of `a`.**
