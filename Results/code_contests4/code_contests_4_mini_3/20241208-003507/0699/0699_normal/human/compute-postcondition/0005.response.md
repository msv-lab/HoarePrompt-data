According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). Since `i` is 0, the loop can execute again. 

After this iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1**
