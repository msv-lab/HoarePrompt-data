Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `x`, and a list of integers `a`. It calculates the total sum of the elements in `a` and the sum of the ceiling of each element in `a` divided by `x`. It then prints two values: the integer division of the total sum by `x` and the sum of the ceilings. The function does not explicitly return any value. **
