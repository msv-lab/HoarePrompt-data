To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic of the code against the problem description.

The problem requires us to compute the minimum and maximum beauty of an array after potentially merging adjacent elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the ceilings of the divisions of each element by a given integer \( x \).

### Key Points in the Problem:

1. **Maximum Beauty**: This can be achieved by not merging any elements. The function calculates this correctly by iterating over the array and summing the ceilings of each element divided by \( x \).

2. **Minimum Beauty**: To achieve the minimum beauty, the elements of the array should be merged optimally. The sum of all elements divided by \( x \) gives the minimum beauty when the entire array is merged into a single element. However, the program incorrectly computes the minimum beauty by simply dividing the total sum by \( x \) without considering the ceiling operation, which is crucial for the correct calculation of beauty.

### Example Case:

Consider the input:
```
1
3 3
4 11 6
```
- The expected minimum beauty is calculated as follows:
  - Merging `4` and `11` gives `15`, and then we have `15` and `6`, leading to a beauty of \( \lceil 15/3 \rceil + \lceil 6/3 \rceil = 5 + 2 = 7 \).
- The expected maximum beauty (without merging) is \( \lceil 4/3 \rceil + \lceil 11/3 \rceil + \lceil 6/3 \rceil = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 \).

### What the Code Does:

- The code calculates `mx` correctly as the maximum beauty.
- It incorrectly calculates the minimum beauty simply as `int(somme / x)`, which does not round up as required by the problem.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly compute the minimum beauty due to the absence of the ceiling operation in the division of the total sum by \( x \). Therefore, it does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
