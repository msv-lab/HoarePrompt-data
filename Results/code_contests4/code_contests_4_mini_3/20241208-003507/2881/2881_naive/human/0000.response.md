To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and identify if it handles all potential edge cases correctly.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to reduce the monitor size from dimensions `a Ã— b` to a size that maintains the aspect ratio `x : y` while maximizing the area. If this is not possible, the output should be `0 0`.

### Program Analysis:
The main logic of the program involves:
1. Finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` to simplify the ratio.
2. Calculating how much we can scale down the monitor dimensions based on the simplified ratio.
3. The core logic checks how much we can scale the dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio constraint using binary search.

### Identifying Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Values**: 
   - Input: `1 1 1 2`
   - The expected output is `0 0`, which is handled correctly by the program.

2. **Exact Fit Case**:
   - Input: `800 600 4 3`
   - The expected output is `800 600`, which is also handled correctly by the program.

3. **Non-Feasible Aspect Ratio**:
   - Input: `1 1 2 2`
   - There are no values `x * k` and `y * k` that can fit within `1` and `1`, thus the output should be `0 0`. The program should handle this correctly.

4. **Large Inputs**:
   - Input: `2000000000 2000000000 1 1`
   - The expected output is `2000000000 2000000000`, and since the program checks dimensions and can handle large values due to Python's integer handling, this should be correct.

### Potential Issues:
The program performs binary search but does not explicitly check the case where the aspect ratio cannot be achieved even when `gcd(x, y)` is calculated. For instance, if `a` and `b` are significantly smaller than the aspect ratio demands, it should return `0 0`, but this may not be adequately checked.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the logical flow and potential edge cases, the program appears to handle the given examples correctly, but there is a concern about its handling of all edge cases, particularly around scaling down when the aspect ratio cannot be satisfied. Given the binary search might not cover all conditions effectively, especially in edge cases of minimal dimensions, there is potential for failure.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Specific Case of Failure:
For an input like `10 10 5 1`, the expected output should be `10 2`, but the program might not handle this properly due to the binary search logic potentially skipping over valid scaling factors.
