To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires us to resize a monitor with dimensions `a x b` to maintain a specific aspect ratio `x:y` while maximizing the area. The output should be the new dimensions or `0 0` if it's not possible.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads four integers `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`.

2. **GCD Calculation**: It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` to reduce the aspect ratio to its simplest form.

3. **Aspect Ratio Calculation**: It divides `x` and `y` by the GCD.

4. **Min Size Calculation**: The program computes the minimum scaling factor `mi` that allows the new dimensions to fit within `a` and `b` while maintaining the ratio. This is done via `min(a // x, b // y)`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the new dimensions, which are `mi * x` and `mi * y`.

Now, let's consider edge cases and potential failures:

- If `x` and `y` are such that `1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9`, we must ensure that the calculated `mi` is always positive. The program does not handle the case when `mi` is `0`, which could occur if either `a < x` or `b < y` after reduction.

For example:

**Case**: 
- Input: `1 1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `0 0` (as the aspect ratio cannot be maintained with given dimensions)
- Actual Output: The program would calculate `mi` as `0` and output `0 0`, which is correct.

However, if we consider a case where `a` is equal to `x` but `b < y`, such as:

**Case**:
- Input: `100 50 1 2`
- Expected Output: `0 0` (the height cannot be achieved)
- Actual Output: The program would calculate `mi` as `25` (since `100 // 1 = 100` and `50 // 2 = 25`), leading to an output of `25 * 1` and `25 * 2`, which results in `25 50`. This does not respect the requirement, as the height is not valid.

Thus, the program fails to correctly identify that it cannot produce valid dimensions in some cases where the monitor's height is constrained by `b`.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
