The function accepts two integers `be` and `en`, which represent the minimum and maximum scaling factors for adjusting screen dimensions based on a specified aspect ratio. It calculates the largest integer scaling factor such that the adjusted dimensions do not exceed the original dimensions (represented by `a` and `b`). The function then prints the adjusted dimensions resulting from this scaling factor. However, it does not return any value; it only prints the results.
