According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `be < en`. At the end of the last iteration, it is mentioned that the relationship `be < en` is still maintained for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `be` must still be less than `en`.

Since the current condition `be < en` is true, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and the relationship `be < en` is still maintained for the loop to execute again.**
