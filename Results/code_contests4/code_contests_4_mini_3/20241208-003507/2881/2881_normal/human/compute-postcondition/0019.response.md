The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `be` and `en`. Both `be` and `en` are integers representing the original screen dimensions (a and b) and the desired aspect ratio dimensions (x and y), respectively. After executing the function body, the function will return different outputs based on the relationship between the original dimensions and the desired aspect ratio. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers, `be` and `en`, which represent screen dimensions, and return the adjusted dimensions based on a specified aspect ratio while ensuring the values are within the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `be` and `en` (both integers), representing original screen dimensions and desired aspect ratio dimensions, and returns adjusted dimensions based on the aspect ratio specified.**
