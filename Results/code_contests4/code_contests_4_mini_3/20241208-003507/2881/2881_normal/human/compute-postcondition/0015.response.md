`en` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and since `be < en`, `mid` will be a valid midpoint between `be` and `en`. The new value of `en` will be one less than `mid`, which will still maintain the relationship `be < en`. Therefore, the output state is: `mid` is assigned `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and `en` is now `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`mid` is assigned `(be + en + 1) // 2`, `en` is now `mid - 1`**
