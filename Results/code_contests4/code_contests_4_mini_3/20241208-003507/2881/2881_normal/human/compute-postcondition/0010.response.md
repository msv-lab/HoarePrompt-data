`en` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and since `be < en`, the value of `en` will decrease by 1 from its previous state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`, `en` is now `mid - 1`, and the relationship `be < en` is still maintained for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`, `en` is now `mid - 1`, and the relationship `be < en` is still maintained for the loop to execute again.**
