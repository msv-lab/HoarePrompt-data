According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `be` and `en` are integers representing the original screen dimensions and the desired aspect ratio dimensions. For the loop to execute the first time, `be` must be less than `en`. 

Since both `be` and `en` are integers, and considering they represent dimensions, it is necessary for `be` to be less than `en`. Therefore, if `be` is equal to or greater than `en`, it needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **for the loop to execute the first time, `be` must be less than `en`.**
