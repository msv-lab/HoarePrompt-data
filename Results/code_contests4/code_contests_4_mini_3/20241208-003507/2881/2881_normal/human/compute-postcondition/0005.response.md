The value of `en` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is derived from `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and since `be` is less than `en`, the value of `mid` is greater than `be` and less than or equal to `en`. Consequently, after the assignment, `en` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is now `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is now `mid - 1`**
