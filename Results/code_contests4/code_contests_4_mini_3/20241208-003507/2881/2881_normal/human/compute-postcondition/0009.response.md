The value of `be` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is previously calculated as `(be + en + 1) // 2`. The relationship `be < en` is maintained for the loop to execute again, implying that `en` is greater than `be` after this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`; `be` is now equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`; `be` is now equal to `mid`.**
