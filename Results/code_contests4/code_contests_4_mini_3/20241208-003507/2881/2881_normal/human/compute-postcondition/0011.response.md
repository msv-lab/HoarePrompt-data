Postcondition: ***`mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`. If `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, then `be` is now equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`, `en` is now `mid - 1`, and the relationship `be < en` is still maintained for the loop to execute again.***
