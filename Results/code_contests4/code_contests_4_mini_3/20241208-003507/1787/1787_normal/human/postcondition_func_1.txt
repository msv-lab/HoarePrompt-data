The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `p`. It returns the result of `pow(n, p[i] - 2, p[i])` for each integer `p[i]` in the list. However, the code is incorrect as it attempts to perform the operation on the entire list `p` rather than on each individual element, which would lead to a TypeError. The expected behavior is to compute `n` raised to the power of `(p[i] - 2)` modulo `p[i]` for each `p[i]` in the list.
