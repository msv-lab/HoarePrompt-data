There are multiple test cases, with t being a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, and a is an array of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
