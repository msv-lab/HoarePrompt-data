The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an array `r` of `n` positive integers, and two lists `fact` and `ifact`. It computes and returns the value of `t` based on the formula `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod`. However, the code does not handle potential cases where `r` is not a single integer but an array, which could lead to an error. The expected behavior might not align with the annotations, as it seems to assume `r` should be an integer rather than an array. Thus, the function may not work correctly under certain conditions, specifically if `r` is incorrectly formatted.
