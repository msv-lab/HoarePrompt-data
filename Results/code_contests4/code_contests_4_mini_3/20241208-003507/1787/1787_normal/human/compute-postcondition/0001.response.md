According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is a positive integer, then the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, which returns a positive integer. Thus, `T` is already suitable for the loop to execute at least once. 

Since `T` is guaranteed to be a positive integer, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **There are multiple test cases, with `t` being assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, which returns a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)**
