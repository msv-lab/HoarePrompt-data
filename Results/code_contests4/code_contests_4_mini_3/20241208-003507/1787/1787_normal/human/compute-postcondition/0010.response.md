Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[1]` (where `i` is not equal to `p`). The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `i` is not equal to `p`.***
