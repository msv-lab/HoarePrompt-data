The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, meaning that `n` will take the result of the function `func_6()` converted to an integer. The previous state of `n` is not directly mentioned, but it is now assigned a new value based on the function's output. The other variables, `t`, `Arr`, and `p`, remain unchanged in this execution step. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`**
