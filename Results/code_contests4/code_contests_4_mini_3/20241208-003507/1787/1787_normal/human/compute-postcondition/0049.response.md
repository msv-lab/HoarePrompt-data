Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`. If `flag` is 1, indicating that at least one element in `Arr[1:]` is not equal to `p`, the output is printed as 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 0, the value of `n` is printed.***
