The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is an integer assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, `i` is equal to `Arr[2]`, and `i` is not equal to `p`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
