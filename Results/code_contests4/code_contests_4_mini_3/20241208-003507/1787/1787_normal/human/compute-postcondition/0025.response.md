The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` now holds a value between 0 and 99 (since `t` was initially between 1 and 100). The other variables `n`, `Arr`, `p`, and `flag` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, and the condition of `flag` remains as previously described.
