Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases, where for each test case it reads an integer `n` and an array `Arr` of `n` positive integers. It checks if all elements in `Arr` are the same. If they are, it returns `n`; if not, it returns 1. The function processes up to 100 test cases, ensuring that the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. **
