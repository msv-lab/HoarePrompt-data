The value of `flag` is assigned to 1, which is already its current value, so there is no change to its state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is the fourth element of `Arr` (Arr[3]).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is the fourth element of `Arr` (Arr[3])**
