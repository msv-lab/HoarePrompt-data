According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `Arr` list. Since `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, for the loop to execute at least once, `Arr` must contain at least one element beyond the first element (i.e., `Arr[1:]` should not be empty). 

Given that `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `Arr` must have a minimum length of 2 for the loop to execute (since `Arr[1:]` takes elements starting from index 1).

Therefore, the required states to ensure the loop executes are:
1. `Arr` must have at least 2 elements.
2. `i` will be assigned the value of `Arr[1]` on the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 0, `i` is `Arr[1]` for the loop to execute the first time**
