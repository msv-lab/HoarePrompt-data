The value of `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`. The previous state indicated that `Arr` was assigned a value returned by `func_5()`, and `p` is now set to that value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `flag` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, and `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`**
