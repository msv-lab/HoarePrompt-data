The value of `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`. Since `Arr` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` will take on the first element of that array. Other variables, such as `t` and `n`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is the result of `func_5()`, and `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`**.
