The function `func_12` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` positive integers. The parameter `t` represents the number of test cases. After executing the function body, it processes each test case to generate results. The function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_12` is to handle multiple test cases by accepting a positive integer `t` (the number of test cases), an integer `n` (the length of the password for each test case), and an array `a` of `n` positive integers, and then returning results based on the processed information from these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases with a positive integer t, an integer n, and an array a of positive integers, returning results based on the processing of these test cases.**
