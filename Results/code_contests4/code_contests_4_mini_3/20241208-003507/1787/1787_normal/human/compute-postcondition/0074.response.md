Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is an integer assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`. If there is at least one element in `Arr[1:]` that is not equal to `p`, then the output is 1. Otherwise, if all elements in `Arr[1:]` are equal to `p`, then the value of `n` is printed.***
