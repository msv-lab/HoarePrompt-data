The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the value `1`. This does not alter any of the variables' values or states, and only provides an output to the console. Therefore, the output state remains as defined by the initial conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is an integer assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, indicating that there is at least one element in `Arr[1:]` that is not equal to `p`, and the output is 1.**
