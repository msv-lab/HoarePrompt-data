Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is the second element of `Arr` (Arr[1]), and if `i` is not equal to `p`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
