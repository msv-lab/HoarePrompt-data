The value of `flag` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables (`t`, `n`, `Arr`, and `p`) remain unchanged since no operations are performed on them in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State reflects the initialization of `flag` while the other variables retain their values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100); `n` is assigned the value of `t`; `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`; `flag` is 0**
