According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `Arr`. The loop iterates over the elements of `Arr` starting from the second element (`Arr[1:]`). Given that `Arr` has at least 3 elements, it means that there are at least 2 elements available for iteration (since `Arr[1]` is the second element and `Arr[2]` is the third element).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `Arr[2]`, and it is specified that `i` is not equal to `p` (where `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`). If the loop is to execute one more time, `i` will take the next value in the iteration sequence, which will be `Arr[1]` (the second element) for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute again, the remaining elements in `Arr` after the current `i` must still satisfy the loop conditions. Since `Arr` has at least 3 elements, there is at least one more element available for iteration, specifically `Arr[1]`. 

Since the loop iterates through `Arr[1:]`, the next value of `i` will be `Arr[1]`, and `i` must not equal `p` (which is `Arr[0]`) for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is an integer assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, `i` is equal to `Arr[1]`, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must not be equal to `p`.**
