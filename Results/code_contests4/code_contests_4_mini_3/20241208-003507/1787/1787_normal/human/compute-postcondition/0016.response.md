The value of `flag` is set to 1, but it was already 1, so there is no change to the value of `flag`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and therefore the output state is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[3]`. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[3]**.
