According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `Arr` starting from the second element (index 1). The loop will continue executing as long as there are elements left in the slice `Arr[1:]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been assigned the value of `Arr[1]`. 

Given that `Arr` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[1]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to take on the next value in the sequence, specifically `Arr[2]`. 

Therefore, `i` must be updated to `Arr[2]`, and for the loop to execute again, `Arr` should have at least 3 elements (since `Arr[2]` must exist). 

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[2]`**
