Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is an integer assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, `i` is equal to `Arr[1]`. If `i` is not equal to `p`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
