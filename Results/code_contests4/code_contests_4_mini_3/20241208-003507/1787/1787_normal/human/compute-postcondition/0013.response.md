The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
