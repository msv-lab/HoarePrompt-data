Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, if `flag` is 1, at least one element in `Arr[1:]` is not equal to `p`, and the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, if `flag` is 0, all elements in `Arr[1:]` are equal to `p`, and `n` is printed.***
