According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `Arr` starting from the second element (index 1). The current state indicates that `i` is set to the third element of `Arr` (Arr[2]), and the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `Arr` after the current element. Since `Arr` has at least 3 elements, the next iteration will assign `i` to the next element in `Arr`, which is Arr[3]. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to the next element in `Arr`, and we need to ensure that the loop can execute again by checking that there are still more elements in `Arr` beyond the current index.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ `t` ≤ 99), `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is the fourth element of `Arr` (Arr[3]).**
