The function accepts a positive integer `x` and a list `y` of tuples containing positive integers. It computes the last non-zero value of the modulo operation between `x` and the elements in `y` until `y` becomes zero, ultimately returning the last non-zero value of `x`. This implementation resembles the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) but does not handle cases where `y` is not properly structured as a list of tuples. It also does not account for cases where `y` could be empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
