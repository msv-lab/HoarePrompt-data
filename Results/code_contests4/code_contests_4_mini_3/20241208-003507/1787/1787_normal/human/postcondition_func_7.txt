The function accepts a positive integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `y` containing test case data. It returns the result of multiplying `x` by `y` (which is a list and will not multiply directly) and then divides this product by the output of another function `func_7(x, y)`. However, the multiplication of `x` by `y` is not defined in the context of the function, which could result in a TypeError. Therefore, the function's behavior may not be as intended due to this issue. Additionally, if `func_7(x, y)` returns zero, this will lead to a division by zero error.
