The function processes multiple test cases, with t being the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, followed by an array a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) which represents the initial contents of the password. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
