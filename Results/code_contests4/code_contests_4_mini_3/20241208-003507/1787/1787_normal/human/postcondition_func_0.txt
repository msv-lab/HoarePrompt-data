The function does not accept any parameters and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorials of integers from 0 to 100004 calculated modulo `mod`, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of these factorials for the same range. There are no edge cases or missing functionality directly in the code, as it consistently computes and returns the desired values.
