To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the logic of the code and check if it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

The problem requires generating a permutation of length `n` such that no element at index `i` (1-based) is equal to `i`. 

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases.
2. **Logic to Generate Permutation**: The main logic seems to attempt to generate a permutation by decrementing from `b` (the given `n` for each test case) and constructing a string `g`.

However, upon analyzing the code, there are several issues:

- The logic for generating the permutations is overly complicated and does not ensure that all values from `1` to `n` are utilized distinctly. The checks using `b % 2` and the decrementing logic do not guarantee that `p[i] ≠ i` for all indices. This is crucial because the problem explicitly states that the permutation must not have the property `p[i] = i`.

- The output is constructed as a string, which is not a problem in itself, but it does not follow a clear permutation pattern that would satisfy the problem's requirements.

### Example Case to Illustrate Failure:

For `n = 2`:
- Expected output: A valid permutation could be `[2, 1]`.
- The generated output from the program may not necessarily respect this requirement due to the flawed decrementing logic.

For `n = 3`:
- Expected output: A valid permutation could be `[2, 3, 1]`, ensuring no element `p[i]` equals `i`.
- The program logic could easily produce a case where the output does not satisfy `p[i] ≠ i`.

Due to the complex and incorrect construction of the permutation, the program does not guarantee the required conditions are met for all `n > 1`. 

Thus, since there are potential inputs where the program fails to produce a valid permutation, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
