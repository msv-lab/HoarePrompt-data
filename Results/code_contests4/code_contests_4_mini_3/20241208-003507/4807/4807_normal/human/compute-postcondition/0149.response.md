The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is -2, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, then `'-1'`, then an additional space, and then `'0'`, when `s` equals `b // 2 + 1` and `b` is an odd number greater than 2; additionally, `s` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
