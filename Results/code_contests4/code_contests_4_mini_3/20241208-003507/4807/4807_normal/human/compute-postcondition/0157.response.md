The value of `g` is modified by appending a space character to its current value. The original value of `g` is followed by `-2` and a space concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`, but since we are only adding a space in this step, the value of `g` will still include its original components. The other variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1; `g` is the original value followed by `-2` and a space concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`, and now `g` is updated by adding a space character.**
