The variable `s` is assigned the value of `b`. The previous value of `s` was 0, but now it takes the value of `b`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now equal to `b`, and `g` remains unchanged, while `a` must still be greater than `i`, which is currently `n + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is now equal to `b`, `g` remains unchanged, `a` must be greater than `i` which is currently `n + 1`**.
