The value of `s` is decremented by 2. The initial state of `s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2`, which means after executing the code, `s` will be updated to `s - 2`. Therefore, the new value of `s` is `(b - (b // 2) - 2) - 2`, simplifying to `b - (b // 2) - 4`. The value of `g` is not directly affected in this operation but still retains its previous value which includes `str(s)`. 

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 4; `g` is updated to include `str(s)`**
