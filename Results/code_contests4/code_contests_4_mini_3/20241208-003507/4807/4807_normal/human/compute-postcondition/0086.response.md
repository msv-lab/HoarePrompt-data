The variable `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. The value of `s` is already defined as `b // 2 + 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `g`, which includes the string representation of the computed value of `s` along with its previous content. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`**.
