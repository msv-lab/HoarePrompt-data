The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the variable `g`. However, since the initial state does not provide a value for `g`, we cannot determine its previous value or how it changes. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `g` is modified by adding a space to it, but the exact value of `g` before the operation remains unknown.

Output State: **`s` is `b - 2`, `b` is an even number greater than 2; `g` is modified by appending a space character to it, but its previous value is unknown.**
