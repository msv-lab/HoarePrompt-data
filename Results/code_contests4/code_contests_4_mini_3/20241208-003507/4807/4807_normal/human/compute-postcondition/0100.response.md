The value of `s` is updated by subtracting 2 from its previous value, which is `b - (b/2) - 2`. This means `s` becomes `b - (b/2) - 4`. The variable `g` is then updated to `g + str(s)`, but since the value of `g` is not provided, we cannot determine its final state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is updated to `b - (b/2) - 4; `g` is updated to `g + str(s)`.

Output State: **`s` is updated to `b - (b/2) - 4; `g` is updated to `g + str(s)`**
