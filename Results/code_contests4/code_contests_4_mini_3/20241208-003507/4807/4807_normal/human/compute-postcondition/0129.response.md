The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s)`. The initial value of `g` is `g + ' '`, and `s` is equal to `b - 1`, where `b` is an even integer greater than 1. Since `b` is an even integer greater than 1, `s` will also be an integer (one less than an even number). Therefore, `str(s)` converts `s` into its string representation. The value of `g` is updated to include this string representation of `s`. The previous value of `g` is not specified, but it is the string plus a space.

Output State: **`s` is `b - 1`, `g` is updated to `g + str(s)`**
