The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the original value of `g` with the string representation of `s - 1`. Since `s` is at least 1, the value of `s - 1` will be at least 0. Thus, `str(s - 1)` will be a string representation of a non-negative integer. The original value of `g` is as described, which is followed by `-2` and a space. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `g` after concatenation, while `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1; `g` is the original value followed by `-2` and a space concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1**
