The value of `g` is updated by concatenating its current value (which is an empty string) with the string representation of `b`. Since `s` is equal to `b`, we substitute `b` with `s` in the concatenation. Therefore, `g` will now hold the string representation of `b`. The other variable `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is now equal to `b`, `g` is equal to str(b)**
