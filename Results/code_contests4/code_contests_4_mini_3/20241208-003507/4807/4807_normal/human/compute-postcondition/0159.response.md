The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since `s` is at least 1, the new value of `s` will be at least -1. The variable `g` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least -1; `g` remains updated to include the string representation of the previous value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is at least -1; `g` remains updated to include the string representation of the previous value of `s`.**
