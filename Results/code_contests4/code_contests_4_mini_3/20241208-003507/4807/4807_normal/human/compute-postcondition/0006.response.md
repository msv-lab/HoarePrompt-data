The code assigns an empty string to the variable `g`. The previous values of the affected variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and there are no calculations or changes to those variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is equal to the input integer `b`; `g` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is equal to the input integer `b`; `g` is an empty string.**
