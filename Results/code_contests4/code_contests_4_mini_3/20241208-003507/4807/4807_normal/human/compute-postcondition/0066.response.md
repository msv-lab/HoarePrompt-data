In this code snippet, `g` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string representation of `b`. The initial state indicates that `g` is an empty string and `s` is equal to `b`, but it does not provide a specific value for `b`. 

Since `g` starts as an empty string, after the execution of the code, `g` will hold the string value of `b`. The other variables `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b`, `g` is the string representation of `b`, `a` must be greater than `i`, which is currently `n + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b`, `g` is the string representation of `b`, `a` must be greater than `i`, which is currently `n + 1**
