The variable `s` is assigned the value `s - 1`. Since `s` is initially `b - 2`, this means that after the execution, `s` will be `b - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `b - 3`. The variable `b` remains unchanged, and the value of `g` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is `b - 3`, `b` is an even number greater than 3; `g` is modified by appending the string representation of the original `s` to its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is `b - 3`, `b` is an even number greater than 3; `g` is modified by appending the string representation of `b - 2` to its previous value.**
