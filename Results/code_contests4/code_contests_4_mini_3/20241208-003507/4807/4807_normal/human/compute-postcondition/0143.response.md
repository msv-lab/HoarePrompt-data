The variable `g` is updated with the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `s - 1`. Given that `s` is 0, the calculation for `s - 1` yields -1. Thus, `str(s - 1)` results in the string `'-1'`. 

Since `g` was initially the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, the final value of `g` after the operation will be the concatenation of its initial value and `'-1'`. 

The state of `s` remains unchanged at 0, and `b` remains an odd number greater than 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space and then `'-1'`, `b` is an odd number greater than 2.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space and then `'-1'`, `b` is an odd number greater than 2.**
