The value of `s` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is `b - (b // 2)`, which means after execution, `s` will become `b - (b // 2) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 1; `g` contains the string representations of all integers from `b` down to `b // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 1; `g` contains the string representations of all integers from `b` down to `b // 2 + 1**
