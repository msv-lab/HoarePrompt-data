The value of `g` is being concatenated with a space character (' '), but the previous value of `g` is unknown. The variable `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 0 and potentially greater than 1; `g` is increased by a space character.

Output State: **`s` is at least 0 and potentially greater than 1; `g` is increased by a space character.**
