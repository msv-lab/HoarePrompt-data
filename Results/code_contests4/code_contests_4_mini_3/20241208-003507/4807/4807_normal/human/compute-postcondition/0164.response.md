The variable `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`. Since `s` is at least 1, `str(s)` will be at least '1'. The previous value of `g` is concatenated with this string, which means `g` now has the additional string representation of `s` appended to it. 

The output state reflects the updated value of `g`, while `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1; `g` is updated to include `str(s)`**
