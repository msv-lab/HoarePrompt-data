The value of `g` is concatenated with a space, which means that `g` is updated to include an additional space at the end of its current value. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The condition regarding variable `b` being even for the loop to execute again is not directly impacted by this line. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is decremented by 1; `b` must be even for the loop to execute again; `g` is updated with an additional space.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is decremented by 1; `b` must be even for the loop to execute again; `g` is updated with an additional space.**
