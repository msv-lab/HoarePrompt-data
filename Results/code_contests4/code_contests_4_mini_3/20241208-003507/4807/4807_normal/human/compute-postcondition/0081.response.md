The value of `s` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is `b - (b/2)`, so after execution, `s` becomes `b - (b/2) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 1; `g` contains the string representation of all integers from `b - 1` down to `b/2`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 1; `g` contains the string representation of all integers from `b - 1` down to `b/2`**
