The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since `s` is at least 0 and potentially greater than 1, the new value of `s` will be at least -2. The variable `g`, which includes the string representation of `s`, will need to update its value to reflect the new value of `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least -2; `g` now includes the string representation of the updated `s`.

Output State: **`s` is at least -2; `g` now includes the string representation of the updated `s`.**
