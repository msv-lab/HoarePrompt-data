The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since the initial value of `s` is 0, after execution, `s` becomes -2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is -2, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, then `'-1'`, then an additional space, and then `'0'`, and `b` is an odd number greater than 2.

Output State: **`s` is -2, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, then `'-1'`, then an additional space, and then `'0'`, and `b` is an odd number greater than 2.**
