The code appends a space character to the existing value of `g`. The value of `s` does not directly affect this operation as it is not being modified or calculated in this line. Thus, the output state reflects that `g` has been updated to include an additional space.

Output State: **`s` is at least 0 and potentially greater than 1; `g` is updated to include an additional space.**
