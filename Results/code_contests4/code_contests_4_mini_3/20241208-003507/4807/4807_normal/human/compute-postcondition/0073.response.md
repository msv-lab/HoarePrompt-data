The value of `g` is being concatenated with a space character, but we do not have a specific initial value for `g`, so we cannot determine its final value. The other variables, `s` and `b`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - 2`, `b` is greater than 1 and even, and `g` is concatenated with a space character.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 2`, `b` is greater than 1 and even, and `g` is concatenated with a space character.**
