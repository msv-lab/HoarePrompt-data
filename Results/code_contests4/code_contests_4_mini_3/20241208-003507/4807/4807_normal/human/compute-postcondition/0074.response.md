The value of `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. The value of `s` is `b - 2`, where `b` is greater than 1 and even. Therefore, `s` can take on values that are at least 0 (if `b` is 2) or higher depending on the value of `b`. The other variable `g` is modified but its previous value is not specified.

Thus, after execution, `g` becomes `g + str(b - 2)`. The output state reflects the modifications made to `g` as well as the definitions of `s` and `b`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 2`, `b` is greater than 1 and even, `g` is updated to `g + str(b - 2)`**
