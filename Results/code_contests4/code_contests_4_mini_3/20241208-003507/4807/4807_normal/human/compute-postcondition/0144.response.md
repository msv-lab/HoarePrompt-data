The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + ' '`. The previous value of `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space and then `'-1'`. After executing the code, `g` will have an additional space appended to its end. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space and then `'-1'` plus an additional space, `b` is an odd number greater than 2.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, then `'-1'`, and then an additional space, `b` is an odd number greater than 2.**
