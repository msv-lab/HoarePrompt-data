In the given code, `g` is being concatenated with a space character. The initial state mentions that `s` is equal to `b - 1`, but it does not provide the current value of `g`. However, the execution of the code affects only the variable `g` by adding a space to its current value.

Since the value of `g` is not specified in the initial state, we can't determine the final value of `g`, but we know that a space is appended to it. The other variable `s` does not change during this operation.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 1`, `g` is updated by appending a space character**
