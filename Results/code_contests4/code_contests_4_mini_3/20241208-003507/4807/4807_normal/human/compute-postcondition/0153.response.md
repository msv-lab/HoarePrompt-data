According to the code, the loop can execute if both conditions `s - 1 > 0` and `b % 2 == 1` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is -2. For the condition `s - 1 > 0` to hold true, we need to adjust `s` such that `s` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `s` needs to be at least 2.

The second condition `b % 2 == 1` does not provide information about `b`, so we cannot determine if any adjustment is needed for `b` based on the provided information.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `s`.

State: **`s` needs to be at least 2; `g` is the original value followed by `-2`**
