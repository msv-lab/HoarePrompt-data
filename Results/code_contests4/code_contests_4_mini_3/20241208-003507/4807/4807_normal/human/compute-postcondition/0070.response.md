The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to its current value. Since `s` is equal to `b - 1`, the new value of `g` will be the previous value of `g` followed by `str(s)`, which is the string form of `b - 1`. The other variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - 1`, `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 1`, `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`**
