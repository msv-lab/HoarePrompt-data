The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 2 - 1` where `b` is at least 7 and odd, and `g` remains unchanged while we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
