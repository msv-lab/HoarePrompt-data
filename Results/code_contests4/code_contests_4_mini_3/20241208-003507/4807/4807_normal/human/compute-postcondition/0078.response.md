In this case, `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to its current value. The variable `s` is defined as `b - 3`, and since `b` is greater than 1 and even, `s` will be a specific value based on the value of `b`. The state of `g` will change accordingly.

Since `g` was updated to include an additional space character, we can assume that `g` previously contained some string value, and after the concatenation, it will now include `str(s)` followed by the space character.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `g` after the concatenation of `str(s)` and the current state of `s`. The specific values of `s` and `g` are not given, but we note their dependency.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 3`, `b` is greater than 1 and even, and `g` is updated to include `g + str(s)`**
