To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables:

1. The variable `g` is updated by concatenating its previous value with a space and the string representation of `s - 1`.
2. The value of `s` is given as `b - (b/2) - 2 - 1`. Therefore, we first calculate `s - 1`, which results in `b - (b/2) - 2 - 1 - 1` or `b - (b/2) - 3`.
3. The string representation of `s - 1` is then obtained, which is `str(b - (b/2) - 3)`.
4. The variable `g` is then updated to `g + " " + str(b - (b/2) - 3)`.

Since we don't have a specific value for `b` or the previous value of `g`, we can only describe the output state in general terms.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 2 - 1; g` is updated to its previous value concatenated with a space and the string representation of `b - (b/2) - 3.**
