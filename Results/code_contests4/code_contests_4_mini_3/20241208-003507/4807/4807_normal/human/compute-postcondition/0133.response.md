The value of `s` is `b - 2`, and `b` is an even number greater than 2, which means `s` is at least 2 (since the smallest even number greater than 2 is 4, making `b - 2` equal to 2). The variable `g` is modified by appending `str(s)` to it. Since `g`'s previous value is unknown, we can only state that it will now contain the string representation of `s` appended to it. 

Thus, after execution, the value of `g` will be the previous value of `g` plus the string representation of `s`, which is `str(b - 2)`.

Output State: **`s` is `b - 2`, `b` is an even number greater than 2; `g` is modified by appending the string representation of `s` to its previous value.**
