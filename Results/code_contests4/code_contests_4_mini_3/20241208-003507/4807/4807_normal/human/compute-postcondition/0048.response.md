The variable `s` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is `b - (b // 2) - 2`. Since the exact value of `b` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `s` after the decrement, but we know that `s` will now be `b - (b // 2) - 3`. The variable `g` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now `b - (b // 2) - 3`, `g` remains updated with its previous value appended with a space and the string of the original `s`.

Output State: **`s` is now `b - (b // 2) - 3`, `g` remains updated with its previous value appended with a space and the string of the original `s`**
