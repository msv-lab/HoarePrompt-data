The variable `g` is updated by appending the string representation of `s` to it. The value of `s` is `b - (b/2) - 1`, so `str(s)` will convert that expression to its string format. The previous state of `g` includes a space character, which will remain unchanged except for the new addition of `str(s)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`**
