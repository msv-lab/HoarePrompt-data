The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space to the current value of `g`. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the change made to `g`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2; `b` needs to be odd and greater than 4; `g` is updated to include an additional space.**
