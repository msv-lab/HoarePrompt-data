The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `0`, `s` was previously equal to `b - (b // 2) - 1`, and `g` contains the string representations of all integers from `b` down to `b // 2 + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
