The variable `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to its current value, which includes an additional space character. The value of `s` is determined from the variable `b`, specifically `s = b - 2`. However, since the initial value of `b` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. The other variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `g` but keeps the values of `t` and `n` unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`, which is derived from `b - 2`.**
