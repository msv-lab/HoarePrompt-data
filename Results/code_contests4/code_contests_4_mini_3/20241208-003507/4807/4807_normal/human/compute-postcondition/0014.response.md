The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the current value of `g`. The initial states of `t`, `n`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation, but since `g` is presumably a string variable, it will have a new value after the operation. However, the initial value of `g` is not provided.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that the value of `g` has changed due to the addition of a space, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is equal to `b - 2; g` has been updated to include an additional space character.**
