The variable `g` is assigned the value `g + str(s)`, which concatenates the string representation of `s` to the current value of `g`. The value of `s` is decremented by 1 from its previous state, but the new value of `s` is not specifically known. Other variables `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `g` as a result of the string concatenation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is decremented by 1; `b` must be even for the loop to execute again; `g` is updated with an additional space followed by the string representation of the decremented `s`.**
