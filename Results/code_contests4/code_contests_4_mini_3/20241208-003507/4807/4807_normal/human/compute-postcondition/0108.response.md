The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the current value of `g`. The value of `g` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its previous value. However, we know that `g` will now hold its previous value plus a space. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 2 - 1, for the loop to execute again b is at least 7 and b is odd; `g` is updated to its previous value concatenated with a space.**
