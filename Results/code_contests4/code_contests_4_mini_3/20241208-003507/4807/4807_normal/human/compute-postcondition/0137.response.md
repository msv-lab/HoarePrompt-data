In the initial state, `s` is defined as `b - 3`, where `b` is an even number greater than 3. Therefore, `s` will be an odd number greater than 0. The variable `g` is modified by appending a space to it. 

The line of code `g = g + str(s)` assigns to `g` the value of `g` concatenated with the string representation of `s`. Therefore, the value of `g` will now include the previous value of `g` followed by the string representation of `s`.

As the exact value of `g` before the operation is not provided, we cannot specify its value after the operation. However, we can describe the change: `g` will now hold its previous value plus a space plus the string representation of `s`.

So the output state considering the modifications would be:
Output State: **`s` is `b - 3`, `b` is an even number greater than 3, `g` is modified to include the string representation of `s` appended to its previous value.**
