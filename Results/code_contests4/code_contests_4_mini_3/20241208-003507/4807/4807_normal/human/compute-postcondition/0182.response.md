The function `func` accepts no parameters but processes multiple test cases where the first input `a` indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `b` and generates a sequence based on whether `b` is even or odd. If `b` is even, it appends decreasing integers starting from `b` down to 1. If `b` is odd, it appends decreasing integers starting from `b` down to 1, while inserting two specific values when reaching `b // 2 + 1`. The function prints these sequences for each test case but does not return any values. 

Functionality: ** The function handles multiple test cases, reading an integer `b` for each case and generating a sequence of integers based on whether `b` is even or odd, printing the results for each test case. **
