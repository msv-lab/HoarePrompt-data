The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the variable `g`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `g`, meaning the previous value of `g` is unknown. Therefore, we can only indicate that `g` is being modified by adding a space. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is equal to the input integer `b - 1`, where `b` is even and greater than 1; `g` is modified by adding a space character.**
