The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since it has an empty parameter list. However, it operates within the constraints that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The function likely processes multiple test cases based on these constraints. The exact output of the function is not specified, so we cannot detail a return value.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and for each test case, it processes an integer `n` between 2 and 100. However, the specific output of the function is not provided.**
