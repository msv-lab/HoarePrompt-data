The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown as it is not defined in the initial state. The values of `s` and `g` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 0, `g` contains the string representation of all integers from `b - 1` down to `b/2`, and variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `g` contains the string representation of all integers from `b - 1` down to `b/2`, and variable `i` is increased by 1.**
