The value of `g` is being concatenated with a space character. The value of `g` is not provided in the initial state, and as such, we cannot determine its specific value. However, we know that `g` will now contain whatever its previous value was plus a space. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now equal to `b - 1`, where `b` is an even integer greater than 1; `g` is now `g + ' '` (g concatenated with a space).

Output State: **`s` is now equal to `b - 1`, where `b` is an even integer greater than 1; `g` is now `g + ' '`**
