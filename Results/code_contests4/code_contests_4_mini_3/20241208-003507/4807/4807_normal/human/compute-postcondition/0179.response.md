The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables `s` and `g` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 0 or less; `g` is the string representation of all integers from `b-1` down to `s`, excluding 0 if `s` has reached 0; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is 0 or less; `g` is the string representation of all integers from `b-1` down to `s`, excluding 0 if `s` has reached 0; variable `i` is increased by 1.**
