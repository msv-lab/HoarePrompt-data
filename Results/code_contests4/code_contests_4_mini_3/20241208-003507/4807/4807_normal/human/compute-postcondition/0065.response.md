The variable `g` is assigned an empty string `''`. The values of the other variables `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now equal to `b`, `g` is an empty string, `a` must be greater than `i` which is currently `n + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is now equal to `b`, `g` is an empty string, `a` must be greater than `i` which is currently `n + 1**.
