The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2`, and `b` is an odd integer greater than 4. The condition `s == b // 2 + 1` was not satisfied, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2`, and `b` is an odd integer greater than 4; the condition for updating `g` was not satisfied, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
