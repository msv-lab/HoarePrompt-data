To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the effect of the code on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `s` is now `b - (b // 2) - 3`
- `g` is updated with its previous value appended with a space and the string of `b - (b // 2) - 4`, which is now `g + str(s)`

Now we evaluate the impact of the code:
```
s = s - 2
```
This line decreases the value of `s` by 2. Given that `s` was initially defined as `b - (b // 2) - 3`, the new value of `s` becomes:

New `s` = (previous `s`) - 2 = `b - (b // 2) - 3 - 2 = b - (b // 2) - 5`.

The variable `g` remains unchanged in this operation, as it is not directly affected by the line of code executed.

Thus, we can summarize the output state reflecting the updated value of `s` while `g` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is `b - (b // 2) - 5`; `g` is updated with its previous value appended with a space and the string of `b - (b // 2) - 4.**
