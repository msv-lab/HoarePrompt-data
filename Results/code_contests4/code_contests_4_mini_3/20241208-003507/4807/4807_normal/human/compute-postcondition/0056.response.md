Postcondition: ***If `s` is equal to 0, then `s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 5` if `s` equals `b // 2 + 1`, and `g` is updated with its previous value appended with a space and the string of `b - (b // 2) - 4; otherwise, `s` remains `b - (b // 2) - 3` and `g` retains its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
