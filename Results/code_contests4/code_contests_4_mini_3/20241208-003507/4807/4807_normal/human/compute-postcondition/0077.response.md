The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the current value of `g`. However, the values of `g`, `s`, and `b` are not provided, and therefore, the state of `g` is unknown. The other variables `s` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - 3`, `b` is greater than 1 and even, and the value of `g` is updated to include an additional space character.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 3`, `b` is greater than 1 and even, and the value of `g` is updated to include an additional space character.**
