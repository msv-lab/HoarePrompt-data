The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space to the current value of `g`. However, the values of `s` and `b` are not directly affected by this operation. The variable `g` will have an additional space added to it, but without knowing its previous value, we cannot specify it. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is `b - 3`, `b` is an even number greater than 3, and `g` is modified by appending a space.

Output State: **`s` is `b - 3`, `b` is an even number greater than 3, and `g` is modified by appending a space.**
