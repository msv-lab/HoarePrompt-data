The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(b)`. Since `g` is initially an empty string and `b` is an input integer, the new value of `g` will be the string representation of `b`. Therefore, after execution, `g` will contain the string version of `b`, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is equal to the input integer `b`; `g` is equal to str(b)**
