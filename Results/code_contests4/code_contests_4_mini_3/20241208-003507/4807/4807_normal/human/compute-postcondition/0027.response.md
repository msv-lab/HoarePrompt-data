To determine the output state, we need to analyze the effect of the code `g = g + str(s)` on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `s` is defined as `b - (b // 2) - 1`. This means that `s` is calculated based on `b` and will hold a specific integer value after the calculation.
2. The variable `g` contains the string representations of all integers from `b` down to `b // 2 + 1`, followed by the string representation of `b // 2`, all concatenated with spaces.
3. The code `g = g + str(s)` will concatenate the string representation of `s` to the existing value of `g`.

Since `g` is already a string and `s` is an integer, `str(s)` converts `s` to its string representation. The output state will reflect the updated value of `g` after this concatenation.

Thus, the new value of `g` will be the previous value of `g` followed by the string representation of `s`. The previous values of `s` and `g` are not directly affected, only `g` is updated.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 1`; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s` at the end.**
