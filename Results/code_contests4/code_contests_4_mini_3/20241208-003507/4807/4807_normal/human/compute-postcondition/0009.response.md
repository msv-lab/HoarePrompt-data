`The value of s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is equal to the input integer `b`, and `b` is an even integer greater than 1, `s` will be at least 2. Therefore, the new value of `s` will be `b - 1`, which is an odd integer. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is equal to the input integer `b - 1`, where `b` is even and greater than 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is equal to the input integer `b - 1`, where `b` is even and greater than 1.**
