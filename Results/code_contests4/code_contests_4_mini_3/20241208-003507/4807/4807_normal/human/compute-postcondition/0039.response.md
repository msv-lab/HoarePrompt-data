The code appends a space character to the string `g`. The previous value of `g` is not specified, but it is updated to include an additional space. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2; `b` is odd and greater than 4; `g` is updated to include an additional space character.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2; `b` is odd and greater than 4; `g` is updated to include an additional space character.**
