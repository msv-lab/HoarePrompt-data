According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `a`. The loop can execute if `i` is less than `a`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `a` is an input integer. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must be greater than 0 (since `i` is 0). As `a` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it satisfies this condition. Since `a` can be any integer, we can conclude that for the loop to execute the first time, `a` should be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; for the loop to execute the first time, `a` must be greater than 0**
