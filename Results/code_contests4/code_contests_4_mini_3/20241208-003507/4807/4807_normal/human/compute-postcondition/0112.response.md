The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Given that `s` is initially equal to `b - (b/2) - 2 - 1`, after the operation, `s` becomes `b - (b/2) - 2 - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `b - (b/2) - 3`. The value of `g` remains unchanged as the code provided only modifies `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 3; `g` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 3; `g` remains unchanged.**
