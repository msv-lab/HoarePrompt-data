The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is initially equal to `b - 2` and `b` is greater than 1 and even, we can infer that `s` is at least 0 when `b` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `s` is equal to `b - 3`, and `b` remains greater than 1 and even, with the condition for the loop still valid if `b` is at least 4.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 3`, `b` is greater than 1 and even, and for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than or equal to 4**.
