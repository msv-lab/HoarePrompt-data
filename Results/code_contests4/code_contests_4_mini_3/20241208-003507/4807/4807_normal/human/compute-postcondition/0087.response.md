The value of `s` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `s` is `b // 2 + 1`, so after execution, `s` becomes `(b // 2 + 1) - 2`, which simplifies to `b // 2 - 1`. The variable `g` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b // 2 - 1`; `g` still includes the string representation of the previous value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b // 2 - 1`; `g` still includes the string representation of `s` before the update.**
