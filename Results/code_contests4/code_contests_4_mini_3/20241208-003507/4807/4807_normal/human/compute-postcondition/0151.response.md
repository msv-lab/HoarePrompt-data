The code appends a space to the string `g`. The initial value of `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, then `'-1'`, then an additional space, and then `'0'`. The value of `s` is not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `s` and the updated value of `g`.

Output State: **`s` is -2; `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by two spaces, `'-1'`, and `'0'`**
