The variable `g` is reassigned to an empty string `''`. The previous value of `g`, which is the string representation of all integers from `b - 1` down to `b/2`, is overwritten. The value of `s` remains the same, as it is equal to `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now equal to `b`, `g` is an empty string `''`.

Output State: **`s` is now equal to `b`, `g` is an empty string `''`**
