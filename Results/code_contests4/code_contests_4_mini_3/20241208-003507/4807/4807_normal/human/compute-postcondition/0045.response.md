The value of `g` is updated by appending a space to it. The previous value of `g` is not specified, but it remains unchanged as the only operation performed is appending a space. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2`, `b` is an odd integer greater than 4, and `g` has a space appended to its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2`, `b` is an odd integer greater than 4, and `g` has a space appended to its previous value.**
