`g` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string representation of `s`. The current value of `s` is -2, and `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by two spaces, `'-1'`, and `'0'`. The exact value of `g` before the operation is not specified in the initial state, but it will be modified to include the string representation of `s`. After concatenation, `g` will end with `'-2'`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is -2; `g` is the original value followed by `'-2'`.

Output State: **`s` is -2; `g` is the original value followed by `'-2'**
