The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s - 1)`. The value of `s` is at least 0 and potentially greater than 1, which means `s - 1` could be -1 or greater. Therefore, `str(s - 1)` converts that result into a string and appends it to `g`. The state of `s` does not change, and the previous value of `g` is also not specified, so the output state reflects the changes made to `g` based on the expression.

Output State: **`s` is at least 0 and potentially greater than 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s - 1`.**
