The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Initially, `s` is `b - 1`, and since `b` is an even number greater than 2, `s` is at least `1` (if `b` is `2`, `s` would be `1`). Therefore, after executing the code, `s` will become `b - 2`. The state of `b` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is `b - 2`, `b` is an even number greater than 2**
