The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` needs to be at least 2, after the execution, `s` will be at least 1. The variable `g` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1; `g` is the original value followed by `-2`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1; `g` is the original value followed by `-2**
