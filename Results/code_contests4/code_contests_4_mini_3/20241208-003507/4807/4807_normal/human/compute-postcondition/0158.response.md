The variable `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to its previous value. The previous value of `g` is the original value followed by `-2` and a space concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`. After this operation, `g` will now include the value of `s` as a string at the end.

Since `s` is at least 1, the string representation of `s` will be at least `"1"`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.**
