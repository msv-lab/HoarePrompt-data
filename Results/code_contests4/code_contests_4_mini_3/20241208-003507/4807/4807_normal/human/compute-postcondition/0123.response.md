The value of `s` is assigned the value of `b`. The previous value of `s` is 0, but it is updated to the value of `b`, which is an input integer. The variable `g` remains unchanged and continues to represent the string of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now equal to `b`, while `g` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is now equal to `b`, `g` contains the string representation of all integers from `b - 1` down to `b/2`**
