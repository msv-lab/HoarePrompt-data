The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is initially equal to `b - 1`, the new value of `s` becomes `(b - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `b - 2`. The statement does not affect `b`, and since `b` must be greater than 1 and even for the loop to execute again, this condition remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - 2`, and `b` is greater than 1 and even.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 2`, and `b` is greater than 1 and even**
