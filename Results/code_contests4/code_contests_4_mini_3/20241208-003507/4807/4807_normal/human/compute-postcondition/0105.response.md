The value of `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. The value of `s` is given as `b - (b/2) - 1` decremented by 1, which means that `s` is effectively `b - (b/2) - 2`. The variable `g` is unchanged prior to this operation, and a space is appended to `g` before the concatenation. Therefore, after executing the code, `g` will hold the previous value plus a space and the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 2`; `g` is updated to the previous value plus a space and the string representation of `s`.**
