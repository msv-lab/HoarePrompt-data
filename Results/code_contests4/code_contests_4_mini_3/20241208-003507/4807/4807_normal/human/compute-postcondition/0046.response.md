The value of `g` is updated by appending the string representation of `s`. The value of `s` is determined by the expression `b - (b // 2) - 2`, where `b` is an odd integer greater than 4. The exact numeric value of `s` depends on the specific value of `b`, but since `b` is odd and greater than 4, `s` will have a concrete value. The previous value of `g` has a space appended to it. 

After executing the code, `g` will contain its previous value plus the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b // 2) - 2`; `g` is updated to its previous value with a space and the string of `s` appended.**
