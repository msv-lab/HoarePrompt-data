Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1. If `s` is equal to 0, no changes are made to `g`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `g` remains updated to include the string representation of the previous value of `s` if `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, and if `s` is not equal to `b // 2 + 1`, no changes are made to `g`.***
