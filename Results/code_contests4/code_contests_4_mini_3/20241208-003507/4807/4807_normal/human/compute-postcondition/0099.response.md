The value of `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. The initial state shows that `s` has been calculated as `b - (b/2) - 2`, which simplifies to `s = b/2 - 2`. The variable `g` is updated to include this new value of `s` as a string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is `b - (b/2) - 2`; `g` is updated to `g + str(s)`.

Output State: **`s` is `b - (b/2) - 2`; `g` is updated to `g + str(s)`**
