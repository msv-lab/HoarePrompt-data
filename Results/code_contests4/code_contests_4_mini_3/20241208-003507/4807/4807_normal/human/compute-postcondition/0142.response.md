The value of `g` is modified by concatenating a space character `' '` to its current value. The previous value of `g` is the string representation of `b - 1`. The other variables `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, and `b` is an odd number greater than 2.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, `b` is an odd number greater than 2**
