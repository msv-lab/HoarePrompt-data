The code assigns a space character to the variable `g`, effectively concatenating a space to the existing value of `g`. The values of `s` and `b` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 1`, and `g` is updated to include a space character.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - (b/2) - 1`, `g` is updated to include a space character**
