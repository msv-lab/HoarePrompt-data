The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to the existing value of `g`. Since `s` is 0, the string representation of `s` is `'0'`. Thus, the new value of `g` becomes the original `g` followed by `'0'`. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, then `'-1'`, then an additional space, and then `'0'`, and `b` is an odd number greater than 2.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b - 1` followed by a space, then `'-1'`, then an additional space, and then `'0'`, and `b` is an odd number greater than 2.**
