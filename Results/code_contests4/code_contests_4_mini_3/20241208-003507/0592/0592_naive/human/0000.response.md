To verify the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze the problem description and then the code logic.

### Problem Description:
Vasya has two girlfriends, Dasha and Masha, with trains running towards them at different frequencies. The task is to determine which girlfriend Vasya visits more frequently based on the train schedules. 

### Analysis of the Program:
The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)

(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
g = a * b / func_1(a, b)
if g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1:
    print('Equal')
elif a < b:
    print('Dasha')
else:
    print('Masha')
```

1. The function `func_1(a, b)` is a recursive function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. This is correct as it uses the Euclidean algorithm.
  
2. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `g = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`. This is also correct.

3. The program then checks the condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` to determine if Vasya goes to both girls equally often. This condition seems to imply that he visits both girlfriends equally if the LCM divided by the frequency of the less frequent train is exactly one more than the LCM divided by the frequency of the more frequent train.

4. If the condition is not satisfied, it checks which train frequency is less to determine which girlfriend Vasya visits more often.

### Potential Cases:
Let's consider the provided examples:
- For input `3 7`, Vasya should go to Dasha more often, which the code correctly identifies as `Dasha`.
- For input `5 3`, Vasya should go to Masha more often, and the code correctly identifies as `Masha`.
- For input `2 3`, Vasya should go to both girlfriends equally often, and the code correctly identifies it as `Equal`.

### Issue in the Logic:
The main issue lies in the condition to check for equality. The condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` is not a valid way to check for equal visits because it does not accurately reflect the frequency of visits to each girlfriend. 

For instance:
- With inputs `2` and `3`, the LCM is `6`.
- Dividing `6` by `2` gives `3`, and dividing `6` by `3` gives `2`. So `3` is not equal to `2 + 1`. However, Vasya visits both girls equally during the full period of `6` minutes.

The condition fails to properly evaluate the scenario where visits are equal, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly account for the condition of equal visits to both girlfriends, it can yield incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

For example, for the input `2 3`, the program would incorrectly evaluate the visit frequency instead of returning "Equal".
