Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently based on the train frequencies `a` and `b`. 

Here's a potential case where the program fails:

1. If we have `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the program should determine that Vasya goes to Masha more frequently because the train to Masha arrives every 3 minutes compared to every 5 minutes for Dasha. 

The program uses the formula `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` to check for equality, but this is incorrect and does not properly evaluate the frequency of the visits. 

For instance, if we check:

- **When `a = 5` and `b = 3`**:
  - The least common multiple (LCM) of `5` and `3` is `15`.
  - Visitation counts within that period would be `3` times to Masha (at minutes 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15) and `3` times to Dasha (at minutes 5, 10, 15). The checks performed in the program would lead to the wrong conclusion.

Thus, the logic used to determine which girlfriend Vasya visits more frequently is flawed, demonstrating that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
