Correctness: **False**

The provided program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this is not what the problem description requires.

The problem description asks for a program that determines which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently based on the frequency of train arrivals (every `a` minutes for Dasha and every `b` minutes for Masha). The program must compare the frequencies, which is not achieved by calculating the GCD of `a` and `b`.

To meet the problem description, the program should determine:

1. If the train frequency for Dasha (every `a` minutes) is less than the frequency for Masha (every `b` minutes), Vasya will go to Dasha more often.
2. If the train frequency for Masha (every `b` minutes) is less than the frequency for Dasha (every `a` minutes), Vasya will go to Masha more often.
3. If both train frequencies are equal, he will go to both girlfriends equally often.

Since the provided program does not implement this logic and instead focuses on computing the GCD, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and it does not solve the problem as specified.
