To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the output hints carefully.

### Problem Description Analysis:
Vasya goes to Dasha or Masha based on the frequency of trains (given by `a` and `b`). The output should indicate:
- "Dasha" if trains to Dasha arrive more frequently.
- "Masha" if trains to Masha arrive more frequently.
- "Equal" if both frequencies result in equal visits.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using a recursive function `func_1`.
2. It calculates `g`, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `g = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
3. The program checks if the time spent waiting for both trains results in equal frequencies and determines to which girlfriend Vasya will go based on the conditions.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the function's operation and confirm that it computes the GCD correctly. However, they do not address how the actual visit count is calculated directly or how the output is determined based on time intervals.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. The code assumes the input values `a` and `b` will always be non-zero and unequal since the problem explicitly states `a â‰  b`. However, the logic used to determine the output based on `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` seems incorrect because it does not properly account for the frequency comparison.
2. The check for "Equal" is based on a division that may not reflect the actual equal visit counts accurately, especially when the GCD is not being utilized correctly in the context of determining visit frequencies.

### Evaluation:
When considering the example inputs:
- For `a = 3` and `b = 7`, the expected output is "Dasha". The program's logic here may not correctly differentiate the frequencies.
- For `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the expected output is "Masha". The same issue applies.
- The "Equal" condition may not work properly due to incorrect calculations using `g`.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing both the problem description and the provided code, it is clear that:
- The code does not correctly implement the logic for determining which girlfriend Vasya visits more frequently based on the provided train frequencies.
- The conditional checks and calculations lead to outputs that may not align with the expected results from the problem statement.

Thus, it is evident that there are cases where the program will not yield the correct output.

Correctness: **False**.
