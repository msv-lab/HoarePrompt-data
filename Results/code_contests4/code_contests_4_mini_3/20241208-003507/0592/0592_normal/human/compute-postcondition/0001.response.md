The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers such that `a ≠ b` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. If `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a` modulo `b`, continuing this process until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the non-zero value of `a` or `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return `a` when `b` is 0; otherwise, it computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` through recursion, ultimately returning the GCD when `b` becomes 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns `a` if `b` is 0; otherwise, it returns the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` when `b` becomes 0.**
