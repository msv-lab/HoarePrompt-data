Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and recursively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns `a` if `b` is 0; otherwise, it continues calling itself with `b` and `a % b` until `b` becomes 0, ultimately returning the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are non-zero integers, as specified in the precondition. **
