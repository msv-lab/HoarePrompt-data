To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1()`.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Mechanics**: 
   - Alice and Bob take turns selecting contiguous substrings of `'.'` and replacing them with `'X'`.
   - Alice selects a substring of length `a`, and Bob selects a substring of length `b` where `a > b`.
   - The player unable to make a move loses.

2. **Input Structure**:
   - The first input is the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, two integers `a` and `b` followed by the string `s`.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - For each query, output "YES" if Alice can guarantee a win, otherwise "NO".

### Program Logic Analysis:
- The program reads multiple queries and processes each one.
- It converts the string `s` into a list and appends an `'X'` at the end for easier processing.
- It uses a loop to count contiguous `'.'` segments and evaluate the conditions based on the lengths `a` and `b`.
- The program checks various conditions to determine whether Alice cannot make a move and subsequently prints "NO" or "YES".

### Potential Issues:
1. **Initial Move Check**:
   - The program checks if Alice can make a move by evaluating segments of `'.'`. However, it does not explicitly check if there are no segments of `'.'` that are at least length `a` before proceeding to the counting logic.
   - If `s` consists solely of `'X'`, Alice would have no valid moves, and the program should return "NO" immediately.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**:
   - The logic inside the loop contains a `raise` statement that is caught in the `except` block to output "NO". This could lead to incorrect conclusions if the segment lengths are not evaluated correctly, especially when the conditions are not mutually exclusive.

3. **Count Evaluation**:
   - The condition `print('NO' if cnt % 2 else 'YES')` is based on the count of segments. This simple parity check does not account for the actual game state transitions or the ability of Bob to respond optimally to Alice's moves.

### Example of Failure:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  3 2
  XXX
  ```
  In this case, Alice has no moves available because there are no `'.'` characters. The expected output should be "NO", but the program may not handle this case correctly because it focuses on segments rather than validating the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Due to the potential for incorrect evaluations, especially regarding initial moves and the handling of game state, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**
