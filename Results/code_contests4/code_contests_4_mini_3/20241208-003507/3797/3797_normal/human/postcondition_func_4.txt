The function accepts a non-negative integer `start`, a positive integer `step`, and a non-negative integer `count`, and returns a range object that generates numbers starting from `start`, incrementing by `step`, for `count` number of selections. The range goes from `start` to `start + step * count`, but if `count` is 0, the range will be empty, as it will not produce any values.
