The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains two integers, and a list of strings `r`. It computes and returns the result of the operation `(x + r - 1) // r`. However, the operation `(x + r - 1) // r` is not valid as written, because `x` is a list of tuples and `r` is a list of strings, leading to potential type errors. The functionality as intended by the annotations is unclear, and the function lacks proper handling for the input types, which may result in an error rather than a valid computation.
