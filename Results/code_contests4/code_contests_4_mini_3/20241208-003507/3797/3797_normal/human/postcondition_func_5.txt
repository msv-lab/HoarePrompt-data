The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, an integer `start`, and an integer `end`, and returns a range object that starts from `start` and extends to the length of the list `l` plus `end`. It does not validate the parameters or check for valid ranges, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `start` is greater than the resulting end value.
