f is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 for each query, and s is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all strings s across all queries does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
