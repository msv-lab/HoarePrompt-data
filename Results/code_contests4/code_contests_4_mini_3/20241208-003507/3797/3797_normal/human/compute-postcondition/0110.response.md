Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character in `s`, and the index is 2. If `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, `flag` is set to True, and if `this` is less than `a`, an exception is raised. Otherwise, there are no changes to `q`, `s`, `c`, or any other variable.***
