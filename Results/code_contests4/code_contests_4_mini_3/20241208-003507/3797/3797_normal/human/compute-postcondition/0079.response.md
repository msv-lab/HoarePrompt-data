Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `c` is equal to 'X', `this` is greater than 0, `b` is less than or equal to `this`, `this` is less than `a`, or `a` plus 4 times `b` minus 1 is less than or equal to `this`, and `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`; if `this` is less than `a`, `flag` is set to True, and an exception is raised, halting the normal flow of the program, and `this` is confirmed to be less than `a`. There is no else part in the code.***
