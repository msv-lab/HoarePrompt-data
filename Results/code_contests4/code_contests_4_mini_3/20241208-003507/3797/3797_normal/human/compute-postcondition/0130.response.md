The code contains a `raise` statement, which is used to trigger an exception. Since the values of the variables do not change, the output state reflects the current state of the variables along with the indication that an exception will be raised. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is False, `a` and `b` are assigned values from `func_3()`, `c` is the first character in `s` and `c` is equal to 'X', and either `b` is less than or equal to `this` which is less than `a`, or `this` is greater than or equal to `a + 4 * b - 1,` and an exception is raised.
