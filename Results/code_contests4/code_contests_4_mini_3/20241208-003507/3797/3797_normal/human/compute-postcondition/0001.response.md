The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. The parameter `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `a` and `b` that satisfy the constraints (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000). The parameter `r` is a list of strings, where each string consists of characters '.' and 'X' with a length that satisfies the constraint (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000). The sum of the lengths of all strings in `r` does not exceed 300000. 

After executing the function body, the program returns the result of the operation `(x + r - 1) // r`, which calculates how many times the adjusted value of `x` can be divided by `r`, considering the tuple structure and string lengths.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a list of tuples `x` and a list of strings `r`, and return the result of the division operation based on the contents of `x` and `r`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `x` containing pairs of integers and a list of strings `r`, then returns the result of dividing the adjusted value of `x` by `r`.**
