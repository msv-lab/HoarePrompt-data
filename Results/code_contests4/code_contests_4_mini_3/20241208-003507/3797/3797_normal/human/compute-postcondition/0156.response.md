Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, and `c` is the second character in `s`. If `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, then if `this` is less than `a`, an exception is raised and the values of `q`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged; otherwise, the values of `q`, `s`, and `c` also remain unchanged.***
