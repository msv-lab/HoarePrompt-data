The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. The values of `q`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, and `c` is the second character in `s`; `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`; `cnt` is increased by 1**
