Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `c` is equal to 'X', `this` is greater than 0, and if `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, then `flag` is set to True, an exception is raised, and `this` is confirmed to be less than `a`. The program flow is halted in this case.***
