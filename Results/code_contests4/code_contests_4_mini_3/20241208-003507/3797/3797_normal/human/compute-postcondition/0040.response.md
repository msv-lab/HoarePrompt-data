Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of '.' and 'X' with at least 2 characters. If `c` is '.', then `this` is updated to 2, `cnt` is initialized to 0, and `flag` remains False. Otherwise, there is no change to the state.***
