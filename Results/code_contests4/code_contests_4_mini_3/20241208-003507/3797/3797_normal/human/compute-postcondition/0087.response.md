Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, and `c` is the first character in `s`. If `c` is equal to 'X' and `this` is 0, then `flag` is set to True if `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, an exception is raised, `this` is confirmed to be less than `a`, and `cnt` is increased by 1. If `c` is equal to '.', then `this` is increased by 1; otherwise, `this` remains unchanged.***
