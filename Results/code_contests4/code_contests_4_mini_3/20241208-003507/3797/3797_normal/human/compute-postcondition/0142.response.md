The variable `this` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `this` was greater than 0, so now it is changed to `0`. The other variables (`q`, `s`, `cnt`, `flag`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `cnt` is 1, `this` is 0, `flag` is True, `a` and `b` are assigned values from `func_3()`, `c` is 'X'.
