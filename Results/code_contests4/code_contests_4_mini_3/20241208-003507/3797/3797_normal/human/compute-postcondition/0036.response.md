Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of '.' and 'X' with at least 2 characters, `c` is the next character in the list, `this` is 1, `cnt` is initialized to 0, and `flag` is True. If `this` is less than `a`, an exception has been raised.***
