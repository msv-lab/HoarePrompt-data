Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of '.' and 'X' with at least 1 character, `cnt` is initialized to 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `c` is the first character in `s` and `c` is 'X', if `this` is greater than or equal to 2 * b, then `flag` is set to True and an exception is raised. If `this` is less than 2 * b, no changes occur to `flag` or any variables, and no exception is raised.***
