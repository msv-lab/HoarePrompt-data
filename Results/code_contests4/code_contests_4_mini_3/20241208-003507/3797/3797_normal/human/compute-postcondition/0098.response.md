The variable `this` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state indicates that `cnt` has been increased by 1, but there are no further changes to `cnt` from the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `this` and the unchanged state of `cnt`.

Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1; `this` is 0**
