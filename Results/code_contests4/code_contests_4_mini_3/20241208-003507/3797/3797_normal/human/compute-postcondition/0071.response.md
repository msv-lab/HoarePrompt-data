Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `c` is equal to 'X', `this` is greater than 0. If `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or `a` plus 4 times `b` minus 1 is less than or equal to `this`, an exception is raised. There is no else part in the code.***
