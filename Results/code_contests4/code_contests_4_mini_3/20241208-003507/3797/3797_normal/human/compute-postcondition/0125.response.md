The variable `this` is assigned the value `0`, which resets its count of consecutive '.' characters encountered before the last 'X'. The states of the other variables (`q`, `s`, `cnt`, `flag`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from input with 'X' appended; `cnt` is 0; `this` is 0; `flag` indicates whether the last processed 'X' was preceded by a count of '.' characters greater than or equal to `2 * b`; `a` and `b` are assigned values returned from `func_3()`.
