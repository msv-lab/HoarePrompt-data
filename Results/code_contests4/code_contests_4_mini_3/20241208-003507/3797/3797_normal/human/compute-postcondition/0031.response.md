The code raises an exception based on the conditions provided. Since the initial state specifies that an exception is raised if `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or if `this` is greater than or equal to `a + 4 * b - 1`, the specific values of `b`, `this`, and `a` will determine whether the exception is raised.

However, given the instruction to provide the output state after the execution of the code, and since the code unconditionally raises an exception, we will reflect that in the output state. 

Output State: **An exception is raised due to the specified conditions related to the values of `a`, `b`, and `this`.**
