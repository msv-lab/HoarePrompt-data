Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `cnt` is updated to 1, `this` remains 0, `flag` is set to True, `a` and `b` are assigned values from `func_3()`, and `c` is 'X'. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `this` is set to 1, `flag` remains False, `a` and `b` are assigned values from `func_3()`, `c` is the first character in `s`, and `c` becomes '.' if the condition is met; if the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
