According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, and `c` is the first character in `s`. After executing the loop body, the variable `c` will take the next character in the list `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters remaining, and `c` will be the second character in the list. Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `c` is now the next character in the list.

State: **`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`**
