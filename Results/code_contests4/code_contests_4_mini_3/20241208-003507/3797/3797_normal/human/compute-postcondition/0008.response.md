The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq b < a \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). The parameter `y` is a list of strings `s`, where each string consists only of the characters `.` and `X`, and the total length of all strings in `y` does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\). After executing the function body, it returns the last non-empty value of `y` before it became empty. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of tuples `x` and a list of strings `y`, and return the last non-empty string from `y`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples x and a list of strings y, and returns the last non-empty string from y before it became empty.**
