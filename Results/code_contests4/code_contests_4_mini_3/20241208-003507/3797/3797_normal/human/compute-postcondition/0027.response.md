Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of '.' and 'X' with at least 1 character. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `cnt` is 1, `this` is 0, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `cnt` is initialized to 0, `this` is 1, `flag` is False, and `c` is equal to '.' while `this` is greater than 0.***
