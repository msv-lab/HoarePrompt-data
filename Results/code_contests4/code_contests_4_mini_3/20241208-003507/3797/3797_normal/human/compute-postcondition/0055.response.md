Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of '.' and 'X' with at least 3 characters. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `cnt` is increased by 1 and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, if `c` is '.', `this` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is adjusted accordingly, and `flag` is updated based on the character processed.***
