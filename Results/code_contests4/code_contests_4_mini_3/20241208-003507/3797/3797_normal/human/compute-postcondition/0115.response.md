Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, and `c` is the third character in `s`. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `cnt` is increased by 1 and `this` is set to 0. If `c` is a period ('.'), then `this` is increased by 1; if `c` is not a period, there is no change to `this`.***
