The variable `flag` is assigned the value `True`, which was already `True`. Therefore, the state of `flag` remains unchanged. The other variables (`q`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `a` and `b` are assigned values from `func_3()`, `c` is the first character in `s` and is equal to 'X', `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, and an exception is raised when the condition is satisfied.**
