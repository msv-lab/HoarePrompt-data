The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: `q`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. 

- `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300000. 
- `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300000. 
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with a length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000. The sum of lengths of all strings `s` over all queries does not exceed 300000.

The function's output is not explicitly provided in the prompt, so we cannot define specific return values or conditions based on the provided constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be determined without further details regarding the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `q` (integer), `a` (integer), `b` (integer), and `s` (string).**
