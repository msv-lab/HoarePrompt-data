The `raise` statement is used to trigger an exception, which halts the normal execution of the program. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but the program will raise an error at this point.

Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `a` and `b` are assigned values from `func_3()`, `c` is the first character in `s` and is equal to 'X', `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, and an exception is raised.
