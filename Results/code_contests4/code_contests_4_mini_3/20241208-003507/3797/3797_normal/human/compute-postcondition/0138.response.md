The code raises an exception, which means that the program will terminate at this point due to an error being thrown. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the execution flow is interrupted. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `a` and `b` are assigned values from `func_3()`, `c` is the first character in `s` and is equal to 'X', `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, `this` is less than `a`, and an exception is raised.
