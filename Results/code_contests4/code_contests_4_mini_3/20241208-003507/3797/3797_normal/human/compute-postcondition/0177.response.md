The output of the code `print('NO' if cnt % 2 else 'YES')` depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is an even number, it will print 'YES', and if `cnt` is an odd number, it will print 'NO'. Given that `cnt` is the count of 'X' characters in `s` that followed at least one '.', we know that `cnt` is at least 1. However, without the specific value of `cnt`, we cannot determine definitively whether it is odd or even.

Therefore, the output state will state that the output depends on the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with 'X' appended, `cnt` is at least 1; output is 'NO' if `cnt` is odd, 'YES' if `cnt` is even.**
