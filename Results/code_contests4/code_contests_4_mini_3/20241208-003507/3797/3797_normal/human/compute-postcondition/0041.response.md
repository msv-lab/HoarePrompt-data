Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of '.' and 'X' with at least 2 characters, if `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `this` is set to 0, `cnt` is increased to 1, and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, if `c` is '.', `this` is updated to 2, `cnt` is initialized to 0, and `flag` remains False; if `c` is neither 'X' nor '.', the state remains unchanged.***
