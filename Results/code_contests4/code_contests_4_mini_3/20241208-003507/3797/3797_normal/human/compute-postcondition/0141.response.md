`cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `cnt` is 1, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `a` and `b` are assigned values from `func_3()`, `c` is 'X'.
