Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, and `c` is the second character in `s`. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `cnt` is increased by 1 and `this` is set to 0. If `c` is '.', then `this` is increased by 1. If `c` is not '.', the value of `this` remains unchanged.***
