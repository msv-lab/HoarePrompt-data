The values of the variables do not change but the `raise` statement indicates that an exception will be raised, interrupting the normal flow of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`, and an exception is raised. 

Output State: **`q` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`, and an exception is raised.**
