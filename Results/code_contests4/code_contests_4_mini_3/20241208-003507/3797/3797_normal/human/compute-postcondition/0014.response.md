The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception and does not change the values of any variables. The variables retain their initial values, but the program will terminate due to the raised exception. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is at least 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of '.' and 'X' with at least 1 character, `cnt` is initialized to 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `c` is the first character in `s` and `c` is 'X', and `this` is greater than or equal to 2 * b, and an exception is raised.
