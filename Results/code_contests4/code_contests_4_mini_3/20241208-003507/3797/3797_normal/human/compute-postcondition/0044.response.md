Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of '.' and 'X' with at least 3 characters, `c` is the next character in the list, `this` is updated based on the character `c`, `cnt` is adjusted accordingly, and `flag` is updated based on the character processed. If `b <= this < a` or `a + 4 * b - 1 <= this`, an exception is raised.***
