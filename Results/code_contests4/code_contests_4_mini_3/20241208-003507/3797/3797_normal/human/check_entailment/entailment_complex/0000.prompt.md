You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 300000; a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000; s is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000; the sum of lengths of all strings s over all queries does not exceed 300000.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 300000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300000, `s` is a list of characters consisting of '.' and 'X', `cnt` is the total count of 'X' characters encountered across all iterations, `this` is the total count of consecutive '.' characters encountered before the last 'X' for the last processed string, `flag` indicates whether at least one 'X' has been processed in the last iteration; the output is 'NO' if the total `cnt` is odd or if any exception occurred, 'YES' if the total `cnt` is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple queries where each query consists of integers `a`, `b`, and a string `s`. It counts occurrences of 'X' in the string and checks the number of consecutive '.' characters between them. If certain conditions are met, including counts being odd or exceptions during processing, it returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES' if the count of 'X' is even. The function assumes valid input as per specified ranges and constraints.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and y is a list of strings s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) consisting only of characters . and X. The total length of all strings in y does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is an empty list, `x` is the last non-empty value of `y` before it became empty, and the final value of `y` is the result of the last `x % y` operation that was valid before `y` became empty.
    return x
    #The program returns the last non-empty value of 'y' before it became empty, which is 'x'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `x` and a list of strings `y`. It performs a series of assignments that ultimately result in `x` being assigned the last non-empty string from `y` before `y` becomes empty. If `y` is initially empty, the function will return the original value of `x`, which is a list of tuples. Thus, the function effectively returns the last non-empty string from `y` or the original `x` if `y` is empty.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 300000), a and b are integers (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), and s is a string of length |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting only of characters '.' and 'X'. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all queries does not exceed 300000.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the input string, which consists of space-separated integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input consisting of space-separated integers, which it then converts into a list of integers and returns. The function does not utilize the parameters q, a, b, or s as indicated in the annotations.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 for each query, and s is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all strings s across all queries does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list containing the results of calling func_4 with f and the dimensions from dim, repeated dim[0] times, if dim is not empty; otherwise, it returns f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `f` and checks if the variable `dim` is not empty. If `dim` is not empty, it returns a list containing the results of calling `func_4` with `f` and the dimensions from `dim`, repeated `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. However, it is important to note that the variable `dim` is not defined within the function itself, which could lead to a `NameError` if the function is called without `dim` being defined in the outer scope. Therefore, the function's behavior is dependent on the existence of `dim`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a non-negative integer representing the starting index for the substring selection, step is a positive integer representing the length of the substring that Alice or Bob can select, and count is a non-negative integer representing the number of moves or selections possible based on the game rules.
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range object starting from 'start', incrementing by 'step', for 'count' number of selections, resulting in numbers from 'start' to 'start + step * count' with a step of 'step'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `start`, a positive integer `step`, and a non-negative integer `count`, and returns a range object that generates numbers starting from `start`, incrementing by `step`, for `count` number of selections. The range goes from `start` to `start + step * count`, but if `count` is 0, the range will be empty, as it will not produce any values.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) followed by a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) consisting of only characters . and X. The sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range object starting from 'start' and extending to the length of list 'l' plus 'end'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, an integer `start`, and an integer `end`, and returns a range object that starts from `start` and extends to the length of the list `l` plus `end`. It does not validate the parameters or check for valid ranges, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `start` is greater than the resulting end value.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, there exist two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) followed by a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting only of characters . and X. The total length of all strings across queries does not exceed 300000.
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of the bit length of (n - 1), where n is a positive integer representing the number of queries.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 2 raised to the power of the bit length of `(n - 1)`. This effectively calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), and r is a list of strings where each string consists of characters '.' and 'X' with length (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000). The sum of the lengths of all strings in r does not exceed 300000.
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the result of the operation (x + r - 1) // r, which computes how many times the adjusted value of x can be divided by r, taking into account the tuple structure and string lengths.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains two integers, and a list of strings `r`. It computes and returns the result of the operation `(x + r - 1) // r`. However, the operation `(x + r - 1) // r` is not valid as written, because `x` is a list of tuples and `r` is a list of strings, leading to potential type errors. The functionality as intended by the annotations is unclear, and the function lacks proper handling for the input types, which may result in an error rather than a valid computation.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
