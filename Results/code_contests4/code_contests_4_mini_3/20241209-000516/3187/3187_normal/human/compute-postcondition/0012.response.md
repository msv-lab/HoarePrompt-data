To analyze the given code snippet, we need to consider the initial state and how the code affects the variables. 

Initial State: `ans` is updated with `[n + 1, j[0]]` appended at index `j[0] - 1`; `i` is 0; `j` is the first element of `edges`.

In the code snippet:
```
ans[j[1] - 1].append([i + n + 1, j[1]])
```
The value of `i` is 0. Therefore, `i + n + 1` becomes `n + 1`. The value `j[1]` is used to access the index in `ans` where the list is appended. 

The first part of the assignment `j[1] - 1` indicates which index of `ans` to append to, and the list `[n + 1, j[1]]` is being added to that specific index.

Since the structure of `ans` is assumed to have already been initialized and has enough elements (at least `j[1]`), the operation will not cause an index error.

The output state reflects that `ans` is modified by appending the new list at the specified index. However, we do not have the exact values of `n`, `j`, or the current state of `ans`, other than knowing that it has been updated.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:
Output State: **`ans` is updated by appending `[n + 1, j[1]]` at index `j[1] - 1`; `i` is 0; `j` is the first element of `edges`.**
