The code appends the list `[i, i]` to the list located at index `i - 1` in `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, this means the code is appending the list `[3, 3]` to `ans[2]`. The initial state of `ans` is `[[1, 1], [2, 2]]` (for `n` being at least 2). After the operation, `ans[2]` will contain the appended list, resulting in `ans` being `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `ans` is [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]**
