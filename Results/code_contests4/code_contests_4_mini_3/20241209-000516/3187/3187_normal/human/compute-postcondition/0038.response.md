According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute for a third time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`ans` is a list with at least 2 sublists, `i` is 2, `j` is the last element in `ans[1]`, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
