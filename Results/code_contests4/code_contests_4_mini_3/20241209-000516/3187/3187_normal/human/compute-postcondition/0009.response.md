The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and in each iteration, it appends a list containing the current index `i` twice to the `i-1`th list in `ans`. After all iterations of the loop finish executing, `ans` will contain `n` lists, each of which contains a pair of identical integers from 1 to `n`.

If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains a list of `n` empty lists.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `n` lists, each containing pairs `[i, i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.**
