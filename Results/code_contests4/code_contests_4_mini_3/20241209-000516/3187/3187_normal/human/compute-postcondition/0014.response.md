The variable `ans` is updated by appending the value `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` at index `j[0] - 1`. Since `i` is 1, the expression `i + n + 1` evaluates to `1 + n + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2`. The value of `j[0]` is used to determine the index in `ans` at which the new list is appended. The current state of the other variables (`ans`, `n`, and `j`) is not directly affected by this operation, but the specific values of `j[0]` and `n` will influence the value that is appended. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` has updated the index `j[0] - 1` by appending `[n + 2, j[0]]`.

Output State: **`ans` has updated the index `j[0] - 1` by appending `[n + 2, j[0]]`**
