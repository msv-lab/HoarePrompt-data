Functionality: ** The function does not take any parameters and processes a given number of colors and harmonizing pairs, printing the number of pairs associated with each color and the pairs themselves. It constructs an adjacency-like list where each color has its own list of pairs, including self-pairs and harmonizing pairs, and outputs this structure. However, it does not handle any edge cases or errors related to input beyond the specified constraints, assuming the input is always valid. **
