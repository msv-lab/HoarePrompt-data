The line of code `ans[i - 1].append([i, i])` will modify the list `ans`. The variable `i` is 2, so `i - 1` equals 1. This means we are appending the list `[2, 2]` to the second list (index 1) in `ans`.

The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list containing `n` lists, and the first list (index 0) already contains `[1, 1]`. The second list (index 1) is not specified, but it is part of `ans`.

After executing the line of code, we will have modified `ans` such that the second list (index 1) now contains `[2, 2]` added to whatever it previously held.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change made to `ans`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing `n` lists, with the first list containing `[1, 1]`, and the second list now contains `[2, 2]` appended.**
