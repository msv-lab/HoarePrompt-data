The value of `j` refers to the third element in `ans[0]`. The `print(*j)` statement unpacks the elements of `j` and prints them. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is a list where `len(ans[0])` is at least 3, `i` is 0, and the elements of `j` are printed.

Output State: **`ans` is a list where `len(ans[0])` is at least 3, `i` is 0, and the elements of `j` are printed.**
