According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the sublist `ans[i]`. If `ans[i]` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is a list with at least 2 sublists, `i` is 1, and `j` is the first element in `ans[1]`. 

To execute the loop a second time, `j` needs to be updated to the next element in `ans[i]`, which means `j` will become the second element of `ans[1]`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `ans[i]` must have at least 2 elements, `j` will become the second element in `ans[1]`, and `i` will remain unchanged.

State: **`ans` is a list with at least 2 sublists, `i` is 1, `j` is the second element in `ans[1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[1]` must have at least 2 elements.**
