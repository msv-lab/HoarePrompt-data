The code appends the list `[i, i]` to the sublist `ans[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, the list `[1, 1]` will be appended to the first sublist of `ans`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `ans` contains at least one empty list to append to. The other variables `edges` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing `n` lists, with the first list now containing `[1, 1]`, and `edges` is a list of `m` elements.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing `n` lists, with the first list containing `[1, 1]`, `edges` is a list of `m` elements**.
