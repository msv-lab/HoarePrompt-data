According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `ans[i]`, which is a list and will iterate over its elements. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` refers to the second element in `ans[0]`. Since `len(ans[0])` is greater than 1, the loop has already executed for at least the first element and the second element has been printed.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to refer to the next element in `ans[0]`. Since `j` is currently the second element, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to refer to the third element in the list, and `i` remains 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `ans[i]` must have at least 3 elements. 

State: **`ans` is a list where `len(ans[0])` is at least 3, `i` is 0, and `j` refers to the third element in `ans[0]`.**
