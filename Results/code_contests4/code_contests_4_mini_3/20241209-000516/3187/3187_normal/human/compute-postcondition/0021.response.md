Output State: **`ans` is a list where each sublist at index `j[0] - 1` and `j[1] - 1` contains pairs of the form `[i + n + 1, j[k]]` for each edge `(j[0], j[1])` in `edges`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `len(ans[i])` is the length of the sublist at index `i`.**
