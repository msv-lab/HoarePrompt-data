To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the effects of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `ans` is a list containing `n` lists, each initialized with pairs `[i, i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
2. The variable `edges` contains at least one element, indicating that the list `j` can be assigned its first element.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
4. The variable `j` is assigned the first element from `edges`, which is a list where `j[0]` is a specific value from the `edges` list.

Now, when we execute the line of code:
```
ans[j[0] - 1].append([i + n + 1, j[0]])
```
- The expression `j[0] - 1` determines the index in the `ans` list where we are going to append a new list.
- The expression `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` creates a new list to be appended, where:
  - `i` is 0 (from the initial state).
  - `n` is a specific integer that is part of the initial state.
  
Thus, `i + n + 1` simplifies to `0 + n + 1`, which is `n + 1`.

The append operation will then insert the list `[n + 1, j[0]]` into the `ans` list at the index determined by `j[0] - 1`.

After executing the code, the updated state of relevant variables is as follows:
- The list `ans` now has an additional entry `[n + 1, j[0]]` appended to the list at index `j[0] - 1`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `ans` list while showing that `i` and `j` retain their values.

Output State: **`ans` is updated with [n + 1, j[0]] appended at index j[0] - 1; `i` is 0; `j` is the first element of `edges`.**
