You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Ivan is a novice painter. He has n dyes of different colors. He also knows exactly m pairs of colors which harmonize with each other.

Ivan also enjoy playing chess. He has 5000 rooks. He wants to take k rooks, paint each of them in one of n colors and then place this k rooks on a chessboard of size 10^{9} × 10^{9}.

Let's call the set of rooks on the board connected if from any rook we can get to any other rook in this set moving only through cells with rooks from this set. Assume that rooks can jump over other rooks, in other words a rook can go to any cell which shares vertical and to any cell which shares horizontal.

Ivan wants his arrangement of rooks to have following properties:

  * For any color there is a rook of this color on a board;
  * For any color the set of rooks of this color is connected;
  * For any two different colors a b union of set of rooks of color a and set of rooks of color b is connected if and only if this two colors harmonize with each other.



Please help Ivan find such an arrangement.

Input

The first line of input contains 2 integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000,    (n(n-1))/(2))) — number of colors and number of pairs of colors which harmonize with each other.

In next m lines pairs of colors which harmonize with each other are listed. Colors are numbered from 1 to n. It is guaranteed that no pair occurs twice in this list.

Output

Print n blocks, i-th of them describes rooks of i-th color.

In the first line of block print one number a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5000) — number of rooks of color i. In each of next a_{i} lines print two integers x and y (1 ≤ x,    y ≤ 10^{9}) — coordinates of the next rook.

All rooks must be on different cells.

Total number of rooks must not exceed 5000.

It is guaranteed that the solution exists.
