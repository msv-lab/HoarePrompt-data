Precondition: **The function does not take any input parameters. It operates under the constraints of 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 for the number of colors and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)) for the number of harmonizing pairs. The pairs of colors that harmonize are provided as input in the form of m lines following the initial input. Each color is numbered from 1 to n, and the total number of rooks must not exceed 5000, with the coordinates of the rooks being in the range of 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.**
