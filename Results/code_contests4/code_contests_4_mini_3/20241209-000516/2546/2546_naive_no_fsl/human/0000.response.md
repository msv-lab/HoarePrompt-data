Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly check all possible combinations of the phrases with A, B, and C syllables to determine if a Haiku can be constructed. Specifically, it only checks three specific permutations of the phrase syllables:

1. (5, 5, 7)
2. (5, 7, 5)
3. (7, 5, 5)

However, there are other combinations that should also be considered. For example, it fails to account for the combination (7, 5, 5), which is the same as (5, 5, 7) in terms of syllable count but does not yield "YES" since the order is incorrect. 

Additionally, any combination that includes syllables other than (5, 7, 5) will not be handled correctly, such as (6, 5, 5) or (5, 6, 5). 

For instance:
- Input: `6 5 5` → Expected output: `NO` (but will incorrectly output `NO`, which is correct, but the logic doesn't cover all permutations).
- Input: `5 6 5` → Expected output: `NO` (but will incorrectly output `NO`, which is correct, but still lacks full coverage).

The program does not ensure that all permutations of A, B, and C are accounted for, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect. 

In summary, the logic is incomplete because it does not check all permutations necessary to validate the construction of a Haiku, hence it is incorrect.
