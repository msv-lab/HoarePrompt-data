Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for constructing a Haiku. For example, consider the input `5 6 5`. In this case, the output should be `NO` because there is no combination of the syllables that meets the 5-7-5 structure. However, the program will output `NO`, which is correct, but it does not account for all possible combinations that could form a valid Haiku.

To illustrate a flaw, let's consider an input case `6 5 5`. The program will output `NO`, which is correct, but it fails to validate other combinations like `5 5 7`, which should return `YES`. 

However, the logic is overly specific and does not cover all permutations of the three numbers to see if any combination can yield 5, 7, and 5 syllables. For instance, if the input is `5 7 5`, it works, but if we had an input that is valid but not specifically mentioned in the conditions, it could lead to incorrect outputs. 

The program should check for all permutations of the input instead of hardcoding checks for specific arrangements. Thus, the program is not comprehensive enough to cover all valid inputs that could potentially form a Haiku.
