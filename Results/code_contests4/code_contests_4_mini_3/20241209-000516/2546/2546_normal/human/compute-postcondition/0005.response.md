The code prints 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change during this operation. The conditions specified in the initial state regarding the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are satisfied, specifically that `a` is equal to 5, `b` is equal to 7, and `c` is equal to 5. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 5, `b` is 7, `c` is 5 and 'YES' is printed.
