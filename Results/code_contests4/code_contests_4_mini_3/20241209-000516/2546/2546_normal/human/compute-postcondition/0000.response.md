The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integers from the input read by `raw_input()`, which is split and converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. Since `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 10, the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be determined by the input provided. Other variables (`A`, `B`, `C`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now input integers within the specified range.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers such that 1 â‰¤ `a`, `b`, `c` â‰¤ 10**
