The annotated program is designed to determine whether the input integers can form a Haiku according to the specified conditions. According to the problem description, a Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7, and 5 syllables in any order.

Let's analyze the program:

1. The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input.
2. It checks the following combinations:
   - (5, 5, 7)
   - (5, 7, 5)
   - (7, 5, 5)
3. If any of these combinations match the input integers, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the three valid combinations that can create a Haiku.
- However, the program fails to account for all possible permutations of the numbers 5, 7, and 5. The valid combinations are not exhaustive, and it does not check for the order of the phrases. For example, the combinations (5, 5, 7) and (7, 5, 5) are covered, but it misses other arrangements such as (5, 5, 7) or (7, 5, 5) in different orders (like (5, 5, 7) is valid, but (5, 7, 5) is counted as the same).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to check all possible arrangements of the syllables, as it only checks for specific hardcoded combinations. For instance, if the input is (7, 5, 5), it will return 'YES', but if the input is (5, 5, 7), it will also return 'YES', which is correct. However, for inputs like (6, 4, 5) or (1, 2, 3), it would incorrectly return 'NO' when it should not be checking those combinations at all.

Since the program does not cover the full requirement of forming a Haiku in any order with the given constraints, it fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
