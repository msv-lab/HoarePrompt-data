The provided program is tasked with determining whether three phrases can form a Haiku based on the syllable counts A, B, and C, which must match the specific structure of 5, 7, and 5 syllables. 

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads three integers, which are expected to represent the syllable counts of three phrases.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program checks for three specific arrangements of the phrases:
     - (5, 5, 7)
     - (5, 7, 5)
     - (7, 5, 5)
   - If any of these arrangements match the input values, it prints "YES".
   - If none of these arrangements match, it prints "NO".

3. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem states that a valid Haiku consists of one phrase with 5 syllables, one with 7 syllables, and another with 5 syllables.
   - Therefore, the correct combinations must allow for the structure of (5, 7, 5), regardless of the order.

4. **Coverage of Cases**:
   - The program checks for all permutations of the valid Haiku structure (5, 5, 7) in the context of A, B, and C.
   - However, the program does not cover the case where the input may not strictly follow the structure of two 5 syllables and one 7 syllables. 
   - For example, if the input is (6, 6, 6), the program will incorrectly return "NO" as it does not account for cases where values are not specifically 5 or 7 but still do not form a valid Haiku structure.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program fails to check whether the sum of the phrases' syllable counts can ever meet the requirement of having exactly two phrases with 5 syllables and one with 7 syllables in any order. 
   - Hence, it does not correctly determine the ability to form a Haiku based on the given problem description.

Because the program does not always fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for all possible inputs within the given constraints, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
