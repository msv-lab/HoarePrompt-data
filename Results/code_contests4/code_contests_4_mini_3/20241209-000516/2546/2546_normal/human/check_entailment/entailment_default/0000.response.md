The program is intended to determine whether three given phrases can form a Haiku based on their syllable counts, specifically requiring the counts to be in the format of 5, 7, and 5 syllables.

**Initial Assessment:**
The program checks for the following combinations of syllable counts:
- (5, 5, 7)
- (5, 7, 5)
- (7, 5, 5)

It prints "YES" if any of these conditions are met and "NO" otherwise.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
The program is limited in its checks to only the specific combinations mentioned above. It does not account for cases where the syllable counts might be other valid permutations of 5, 7, and 5, such as (7, 7, 5) or any other combinations that might not include 5, 5, and 7 exactly.

For example:
- Input: `5 5 5` should return "NO" but is not specifically handled.
- Input: `7 7 7` also should return "NO" but is not considered.
- Input: `1 1 1` should return "NO" but isn't checked.
- Input: `5 6 7` should also return "NO" but is not covered.

**Checking Output Hints:**
The output hints state that the function will print "YES" for exactly the combinations of (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), or (7, 5, 5), and "NO" for any other combination. This aligns with the code functionality; however, it does not account for many other combinations that are simply not checked.

Since the program only accounts for three specific combinations and misses many others that should return "NO," it does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not handle inputs that do not match the specified combinations properly and misses various edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.
