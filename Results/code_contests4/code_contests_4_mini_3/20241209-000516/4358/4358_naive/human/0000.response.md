To validate the correctness of the given program against the provided problem description, let's analyze the core requirements:

The problem involves finding the prettiest permutation that can be obtained by swapping elements of a permutation based on the constraints given by a binary matrix. Specifically, the program must ensure that it only swaps elements where the corresponding entries in the binary matrix are '1', and it should produce the lexicographically smallest permutation possible.

### Issues with the Provided Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The input is read using `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. It should be replaced with `input()` for compatibility.

2. **Permutation Swapping Logic**:
   - The program attempts to swap elements based on the condition that `p[i] > p[j]`, but it does not effectively implement a mechanism to ensure all possible swaps are considered until no further swaps can be made.
   - The double while loop (the last two similar loops) seems unnecessary and may not ensure that the prettiest permutation is achieved. The addition of swaps should be done in a manner that exhaustively processes all possible swaps until no further improvements can be made.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output is currently constructed as a single string with spaces. It would be better to print the result as a list of integers directly to match the expected output format.

### Edge Cases:

- Consider a scenario where the binary matrix allows swaps between all elements, but the initial permutation is already lexicographically smallest. The current implementation may not correctly handle this.

For example:
```
Input:
3
3 2 1
011
101
011
```
Expected Output:
```
1 2 3
```
However, the program might not produce the correct output due to its looping structure and potentially inadequate swap logic.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, the program does not guarantee to produce the correct output for all possible cases as per the problem statement. Thus, it fails to meet the correctness criterion.

Correctness: **False**.
