The function accepts a positive integer `n`, reads a list of `n` distinct integers `p`, and constructs an `n x n` binary matrix `A` based on input strings. It performs a sorting operation on the list `p` based on the values in `A`, swapping elements of `p` if the corresponding entries in `A` are both `1`. Finally, it outputs the sorted list `p` as a space-separated string. However, the sorting process may not correctly reflect all potential relationships defined by `A`, and the function does not handle cases where the input values are invalid or out of range.
