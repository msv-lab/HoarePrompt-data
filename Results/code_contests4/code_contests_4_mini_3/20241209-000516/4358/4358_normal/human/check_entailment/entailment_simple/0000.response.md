Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This would cause the program to fail in execution.

2. **Improper Swapping Logic**: The logic for swapping elements in the permutation based on the adjacency matrix is flawed. The swaps are only attempted if `p[i] > p[j]` and `a[i][j] == 1`. However, this does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will be the prettiest permutation possible. The adjacency matrix `A` indicates which elements can be swapped, but the sorting logic does not account for the connected components defined by the matrix. 

3. **Repeated Sorting Logic**: The program attempts to sort the permutation in a nested loop twice, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to achieving the goal of obtaining the prettiest permutation. The second loop does not change the state of `p` after the first loop, making it redundant.

4. **Output Format**: The output string `s` ends with an additional space, which may not conform to the expected output format. The program should ensure that output matches the requirement of space-separated integers without any trailing spaces.

5. **Lack of Graph Traversal**: The program fails to utilize graph traversal (such as DFS or BFS) to explore all the connected components in the adjacency matrix. This is crucial for determining which elements can be swapped to achieve the prettiest permutation. The current implementation does not effectively find the connected components and then sort the values within those components.

Due to these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and therefore is not correct.
