The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing `j` from 3 to 4. The states of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `a`, and `tmp`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, and the conditions involving `p` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, and the conditions involving `p` and `a` remain unchanged.**
