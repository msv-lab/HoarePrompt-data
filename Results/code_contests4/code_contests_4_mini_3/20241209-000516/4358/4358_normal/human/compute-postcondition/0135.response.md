According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is 3 and `n` is greater than 2. Since `j` (which is 3) is not less than `n` (which is greater than 2), the loop cannot execute. 

To allow the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `n`. This can be achieved by adjusting `n` to be greater than 3. 

No other states need to be adjusted since the state of `p` remains unchanged and `i` does not affect the loop condition.

State: **`j` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 3**
