The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The string `s` and the list `b` are not affected by this operation directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is now 3, `s` is a non-empty string, and `b` remains unchanged until further conditions are evaluated based on the character at index `j` of `s`.

Output State: **`j` is now 3, `s` is a non-empty string, and `b` remains unchanged**.
