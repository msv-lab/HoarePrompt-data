Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are 1, then `p[i]` becomes equal to `p[j]`, and `p[j]` is assigned the previous value of `p[i]`. If the conditions are not met, there are no changes to `p[i]` and `p[j]`.***
