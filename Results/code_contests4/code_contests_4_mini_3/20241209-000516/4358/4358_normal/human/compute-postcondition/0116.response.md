After executing the code, the value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 2, so after the execution, `j` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `n`, `p[i]`, `p[j]`, `a[i][j]`, and `a[j][i]` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2**
