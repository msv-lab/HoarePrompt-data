The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The variable `s` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `s` is concatenated with `str(p[2]) + ' '`. 

Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is concatenated with `str(p[2]) + ' '`**
