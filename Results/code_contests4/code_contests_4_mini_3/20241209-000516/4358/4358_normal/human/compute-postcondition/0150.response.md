The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The other variables `p` and `a` are not affected by this operation, and the conditions involving `p[i]`, `p[j]`, `a[i][j]`, and `a[j][i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 5, and the conditions involving `p` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 5, and the conditions involving `p` and `a` remain unchanged.**
