The code `b.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `b`. The list `b` is initially empty, so after this operation, `b` will contain one element, which is `1`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 0; `b` is [1]; `s` is a non-empty string (len(s) > 0) and the character at index `j` of `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 0; `b` is [1]; `s` is a non-empty string (len(s) > 0) and the character at index `j` of `s` is '1'**.
