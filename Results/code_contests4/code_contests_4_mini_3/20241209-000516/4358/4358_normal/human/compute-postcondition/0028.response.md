The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Thus, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 1; `a` is a list containing `b`; `j` is `len(s)`; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` contains a list of integers derived from the characters in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 1; `a` is a list containing `b`; `j` is `len(s)`; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` contains a list of integers derived from the characters in `s`.**
