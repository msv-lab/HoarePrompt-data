Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. If the value at index `i` in array `p` is greater than the value at index `j`, and if `a[i][j]` is 1 and `a[j][i]` is also 1, then `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` in array `p`, and `p[j]` is updated to the value of `p[i]`. If the condition is not met, there are no changes to the values of `tmp` or `p`.***
