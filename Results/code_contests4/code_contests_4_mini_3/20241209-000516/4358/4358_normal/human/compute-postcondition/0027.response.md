The code `a.append(b)` adds the list `b` to the list `a`. Since `a` is initially an empty list, after the execution, `a` will now contain one element, which is the list `b`. The values of the other variables, `n`, `p`, `i`, `j`, and `s`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is a list containing `b`; `j` is `len(s)`; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` contains a list of integers derived from the characters in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is a list containing `b`; `j` is `len(s)`; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` contains a list of integers derived from the characters in `s`.**
