According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2**.
