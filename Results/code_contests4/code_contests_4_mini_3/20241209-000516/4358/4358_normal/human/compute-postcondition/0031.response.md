The variable `b` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 0; `b` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 0; `b` is an empty list**.
