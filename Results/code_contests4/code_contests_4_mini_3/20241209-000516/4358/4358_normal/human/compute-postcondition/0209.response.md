To determine the output state, we analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State: `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`.

The code `p[i] = p[j]` means that the value at index `j` of the list `p` will be assigned to the index `i` of the list `p`. 

1. The value of `i` is 1, and the value of `j` is 4.
2. The expression `p[j]` refers to the element at index 4 of the list `p`.
3. The element at index 4 of `p` is assigned to the element at index 1 of `p`.

The values of `i`, `j`, and `tmp` are not directly altered by this assignment, but `p[1]` now holds the value that was previously in `p[4]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `p[1]` has been changed to the value of `p[4]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`, and `p[1]` is now equal to `p[4]`.**
