According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is 2 and `n` is the original value of `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be greater than 2. Therefore, the state of `n` must be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 2**
