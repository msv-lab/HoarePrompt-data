Postcondition: ***`j` is 5. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[5]` and `a[i][5]` equals 1 and `a[5][i]` equals 1, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[i]` is updated to the value of `p[5]`, and `p[5]` is updated to the original value of `p[i]`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made.***
