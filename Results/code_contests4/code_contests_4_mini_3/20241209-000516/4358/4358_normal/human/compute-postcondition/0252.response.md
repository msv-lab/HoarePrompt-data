According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 2. There are no additional states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2**
