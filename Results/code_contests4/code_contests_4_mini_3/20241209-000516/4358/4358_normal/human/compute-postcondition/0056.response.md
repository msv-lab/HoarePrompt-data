The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input from the user. The values of `j`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is now 0, `b` is [], `a` remains unchanged, and `s` is an input string from `raw_input()`. 

Output State: **`j` is now 0, `b` is [], `a` remains unchanged, `s` is an input string from `raw_input()`**
