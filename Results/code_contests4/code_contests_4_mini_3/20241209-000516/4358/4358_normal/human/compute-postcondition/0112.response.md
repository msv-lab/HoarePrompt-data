The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since initially `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, after execution, `p[1]` will now hold the value of `p[2]`. The previous value of `p[i]` is not specified, but it is known that `p[i]` (which is `p[1]`) was greater than `p[j]` (which is `p[2]`). Therefore, the overall value of `p[i]` changes, but we do not have the specific values of `p[1]` and `p[2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, the value of `p[i]` is now equal to the value of `p[j]`, and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before the change.**
