The list `b` is appended with the value `0`. The previous state of `b` was an empty list, so after execution, `b` will contain the single element `[0]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `b` is [0]; `s` is a non-empty string; the character at index `j` of `s` is not '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `b` is [0]; `s` is a non-empty string; the character at index `j` of `s` is not '1'.**
