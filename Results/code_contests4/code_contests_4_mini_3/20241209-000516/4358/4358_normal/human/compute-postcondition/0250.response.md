The value of `s` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `p[i]` and a space to it. The variable `i` is currently 1, so `p[i]` refers to the value at index 1 of the list `p`. The previous value of `s` is not given, but it is being modified. The state of other variables is not affected in this snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `s` is updated to include `str(p[1])` followed by a space.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is updated to include `str(p[1])` followed by a space**
