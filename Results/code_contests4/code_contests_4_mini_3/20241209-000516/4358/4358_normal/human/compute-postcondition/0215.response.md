The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 1 to 2. The other variables `j`, `n`, and `p` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.**
