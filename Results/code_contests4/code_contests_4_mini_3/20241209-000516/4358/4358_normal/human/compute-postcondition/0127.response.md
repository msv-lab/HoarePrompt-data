To determine the output state, we start with the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is 4
- `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]` (we don't know the value of `p[1]` yet)
- `p[1]` is assigned the value of `p[4]` (we don't know the value of `p[4]` yet)

Now executing the line of code:

```
p[j] = tmp
```

This means `p[4]` (since `j` is 4) is assigned the value stored in `tmp`. At this point, `tmp` holds the original value of `p[1]` (which is unknown to us). 

Since we don't have the specific values for `p[1]` and `p[4]`, we can't determine exact values for them, but we can summarize the operations:

1. `tmp` holds the value of `p[1]`.
2. `p[4]` is updated to the value of `tmp`, which is `p[1]`.

Thus, the output state reflects the assignments made without specific values for `p[1]` and `p[4]`. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `tmp` is the value of `p[1]`, and `p[4]` is assigned the value of `p[1]`.**
