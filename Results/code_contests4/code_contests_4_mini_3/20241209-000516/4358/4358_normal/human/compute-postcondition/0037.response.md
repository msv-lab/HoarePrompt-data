The code `b.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `b`. Since `b` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `b` will contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 300, `j` is 0, `b` is a list containing a single element [0], and `s` is a non-empty string (len(s) > 0) with the first character not being '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 300, `j` is 0, `b` is [0], `s` is a non-empty string (len(s) > 0) and s[0] != '1'**
