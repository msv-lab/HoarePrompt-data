`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `tmp` will take the value of `p[0]`. The values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `tmp` is `p[0]`, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged, with the loop condition still allowing execution if `n` is greater than 2.
