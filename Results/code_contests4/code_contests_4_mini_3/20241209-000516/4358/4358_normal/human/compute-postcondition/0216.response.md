According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is equal to `n`. Since `j` represents the current value of `n`, it indicates that `n` has not changed and is still the original value of `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 2 and `n` is unchanged, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is that `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2**
