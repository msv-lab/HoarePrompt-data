In the initial state, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `tmp` holds the value of `p[0]`. The code `p[j] = tmp` assigns the value of `tmp` to the element in the list `p` at index `j`, which is `p[2]`. Since `tmp` is equal to `p[0]`, the value of `p[2]` will be updated to the value of `p[0]`.

The output state reflects the updated value of `p[2]` but does not provide the specific value unless `p[0]` is defined. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `tmp` is `p[0]`, and `p[2]` is now equal to `p[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `tmp` is `p[0]`, and `p[2]` is now equal to `p[0]**
