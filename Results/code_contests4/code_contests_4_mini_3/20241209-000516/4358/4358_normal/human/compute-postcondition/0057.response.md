According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `s`. Right before the loop, `j` is 0, and `s` is an input string. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of `s` must be greater than 0. Thus, `s` must be a non-empty string.

State: **`j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `s` is a non-empty string**
