The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The values of `j`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.**
