The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially 0, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n` and `b`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 1; `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 depending on the value of the character at index `j` of `s`, which is a non-empty string (len(s) > 0).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 1; `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 depending on the value of the character at index `j` of `s`, which is a non-empty string (len(s) > 0).**
