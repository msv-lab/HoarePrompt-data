The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `p[i]` (which is `p[0]`) will be updated to the value of `p[2]`. The value of `tmp` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `p[0]` but does not include a specific value since `p[2]` is not defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2; `p[0]` is updated to the value of `p[2]`.**
