The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `i` was `n`, and since `i` is now set to `0`, it changes from its original value. The values of `j`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is now `0`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is now 0, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.**
