According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the original value of `n`, which means `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the loop will execute again as long as `i` remains less than `n`. No adjustments are needed to the states, as the current values allow the loop to proceed.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged**.
