The value of `tmp` is assigned from `p[i]`, where `i` is 2. However, the value of `p` is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific value of `tmp`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[2]`, which is unknown.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[2]`, which is unknown.**
