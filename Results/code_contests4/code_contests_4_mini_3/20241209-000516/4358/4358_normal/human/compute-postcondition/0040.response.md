According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `len(s)`. If `j` is less than `len(s)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `s` is a non-empty string, which means that `len(s)` is at least 1. Since `j` must be less than `len(s)` for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing, as currently, we only know that `j` is 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `len(s)` must be greater than 1**
