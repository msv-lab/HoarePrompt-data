The code assigns the value of `tmp` to `p[j]`. Since `tmp` was previously assigned the value of `p[i]`, this means that `p[j]` will now hold the value that `p[i]` had before the change. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `a[i][j]`, and `a[j][i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, the value of `p[j]` is now equal to the value of `p[i]` (previously), both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before the change.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, the value of `p[j]` is now equal to the value of `p[i]`, both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before the change.**
