According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is 1, but we don't have the specific value of `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` is greater than 1**
