Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 0; `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 depending on the value of the character at index `j` of `s`, which is a non-empty string (len(s) > 0). If the character at index `j` of `s` is '1', then `b` is [1]. If the character at index `j` of `s` is not '1', then `b` is [0].***
