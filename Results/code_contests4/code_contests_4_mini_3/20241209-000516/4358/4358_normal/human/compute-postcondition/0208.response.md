The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The variable `i` is 1, so `tmp` will be assigned the value of `p[1]`. The states of the other variables, `j` and `n`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]**
