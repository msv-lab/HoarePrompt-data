The variable `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which was previously assigned the value of `p[i]`. Since `j` is 3, the value of `p[3]` is now set to the value of `tmp`. The state of `tmp` is not affected by this operation, and the other variables `n` and `p[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `p[j]` is now equal to `p[i]`, and `tmp` remains as `p[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `p[j]` is now equal to `p[i]`, and `tmp` remains as `p[i]`.**
