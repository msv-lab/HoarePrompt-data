The variable `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the value of `p[0]` will be updated to the value of `p[2]`. The values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `tmp` is `p[0]`, and `p[0]` is now equal to `p[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `tmp` is `p[0]`, `p[0]` is now equal to `p[2]`**
