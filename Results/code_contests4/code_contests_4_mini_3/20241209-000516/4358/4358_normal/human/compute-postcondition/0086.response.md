The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, which is equal to the value of `p[1]`. Therefore, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, meaning `p[1]` will now hold the value that was previously in `p[0]`. The other variables `i`, `n`, and the relationship between `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the value of `p[0]` is now equal to the value of `p[1]`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[1]` is now updated to the value of `tmp`.**
