The value of `tmp` is `p[1]`, and since it is given that `p[1]` is equal to `p[3]`, we have `tmp = p[3]`. Now, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which means `p[3]` will be assigned the value of `p[3]`. Hence, the value of `p[3]` does not change. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is `p[1]`, and `p[3]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is `p[1]`, and `p[3]` remains unchanged.**
