The code `p[i] = p[j]` attempts to assign the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`. However, since `p` is not defined in the initial state and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, which is also undefined, we cannot determine the values of `p[i]` or `p[j]`. Therefore, no changes can be made to any variables.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `p` is undefined, so no assignment is possible.**
