In the provided initial state, we have `i` as 2 and `j` as 4. The variable `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. However, since there is no information provided about what `tmp` is or what value it holds, we cannot determine the new value of `p[j]`. 

The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the variable `p` at index `j` is being assigned a value from `tmp`, which is currently unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the action taken.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`.**
