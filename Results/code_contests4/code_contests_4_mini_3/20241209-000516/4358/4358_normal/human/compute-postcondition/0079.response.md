According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, since if `n` is 0, the condition `i < n` would be false and the loop would not execute. 

Therefore, `n` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 0**
