To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state. 

Initial State: `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `tmp` is assigned the value `p[2]`.

The line of code `p[i] = p[j]` will assign the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`. Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, this means we are assigning the value of `p[4]` to `p[2]`.

However, the values of `p[2]` and `p[4]` are not specified in the initial state, making it impossible to determine the exact values of `p[i]` and `p[j]`. Despite this, we can state that `p[2]` will take on the value of `p[4]`.

Thus, the output state reflects that while the values of `p[2]` and `p[4]` are unknown, we have made an assignment based on the current indices.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`**.
