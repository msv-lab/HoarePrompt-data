In the given code, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0 and `j` is 3. Therefore, `p[0]` will be assigned the value of `p[3]`. The variable `tmp` is defined as `p[0]`, but its value will change after the assignment. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state must reflect the changes made by the assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `tmp` is `p[0]`, and `p[0]` is assigned the value of `p[3]`.**
