Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` is greater than 3. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, and if `a[i][j]` is 1 and `a[j][i]` is 1, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp` (which is `p[0]`). If the condition `p[i] > p[j]` is not met, no changes occur in the values of `p` or `tmp`.***
