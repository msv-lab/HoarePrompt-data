Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. If the value of `p[0]` is greater than the value of `p[1]` and both `a[0][1]` and `a[1][0]` are equal to 1, then `p[1]` is updated to the value of `p[0]` and `p[0]` is set to `p[1]`. If the condition is not met, the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged.***
