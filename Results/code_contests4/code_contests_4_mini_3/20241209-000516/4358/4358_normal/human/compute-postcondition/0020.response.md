The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 1, so after execution, `j` is now 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 2; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` contains either the value 1 or 0 depending on the value of `s[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 2; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` contains either the value 1 or 0 depending on the value of `s[1].**
