The variable `tmp` is assigned the value `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `tmp` will take the value of `p[2]`. The values of `j` and `n` are not affected by this statement. Thus, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `tmp` is assigned the value `p[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `tmp` is assigned the value `p[2]**
