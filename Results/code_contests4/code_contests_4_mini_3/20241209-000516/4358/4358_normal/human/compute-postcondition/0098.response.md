The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, where `i` is currently 0. However, the value of `p` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine what `tmp` will be assigned. The values of `j` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `tmp` is assigned a value dependent on `p[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]**
