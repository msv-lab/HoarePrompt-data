The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since `j` is 3, `p[j]` corresponds to `p[3]`. The prior state indicates that `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, which means after the assignment, `p[i]` will now have the same value as `p[j]`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `tmp` remain unaffected by this specific assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `tmp` remains as `p[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `tmp` remains as `p[i]`.**
