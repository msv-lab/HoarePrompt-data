The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`s` and `b`) remain unaffected at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is now 2, `s` is a non-empty string, and `b` is unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is now 2, `s` is a non-empty string, and `b` is unchanged.**
