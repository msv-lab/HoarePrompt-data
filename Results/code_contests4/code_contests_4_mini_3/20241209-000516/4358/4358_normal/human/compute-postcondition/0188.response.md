The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables `j`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.**
