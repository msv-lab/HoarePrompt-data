The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, which at this moment holds the value of `p[3]`. The statement `p[j] = tmp` assigns the value of `tmp` to `p[j]`, which means `p[3]` (since `j` is 3) is assigned the value that `p[0]` held before the assignment. Thus, the state of `p[3]` is updated based on the current value of `p[0]`. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `tmp` is the value of `p[0]`, and `p[3]` is assigned the value of `p[0]`.**
