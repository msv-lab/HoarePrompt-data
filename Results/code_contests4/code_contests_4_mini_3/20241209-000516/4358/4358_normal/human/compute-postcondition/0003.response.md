The variable `i` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0**
