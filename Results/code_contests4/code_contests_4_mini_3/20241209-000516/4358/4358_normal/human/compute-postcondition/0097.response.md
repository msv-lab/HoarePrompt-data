According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3. The values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged, so no adjustments are needed for them.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 3**.
