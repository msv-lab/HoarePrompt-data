In the given code, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. The variable `j` has a value of 4, so `p[4]` is affected by this assignment. However, we do not have any information about the value of `tmp` or the current state of the array `p`. Since `tmp` is not defined in the initial state, the assignment cannot be determined or quantified.

Since the value of `p[4]` will be updated with whatever value `tmp` holds, the output state will reflect that `p[4]` is updated but we cannot specify what value it is set to.

Output State: **`j` is 4; `p[4]` is updated with the value of `tmp`**
