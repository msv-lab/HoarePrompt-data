Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix where `A[i][j] = '0'` or `'1'`, with `A[i][i] = '0'` for all `i` and `A` is symmetric (`A[i][j] = A[j][i]` for all 1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `n`).**
