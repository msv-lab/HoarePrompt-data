The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged, and the state of `b` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 2; if `s[j]` is '1', then `b` has 1 appended to it. Otherwise, `b` has a new element 0 appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 2; if `s[j]` is '1', then `b` has 1 appended to it. Otherwise, `b` has a new element 0 appended to it.**
