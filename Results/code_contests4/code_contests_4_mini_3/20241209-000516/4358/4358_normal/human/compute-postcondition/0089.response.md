The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `i`, `n`, `p[0]`, and `p[1]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged.**
