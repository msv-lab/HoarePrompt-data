The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The values of `i`, `p`, and the conditions involving `a` remain unaffected as the code only modifies `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged.**
