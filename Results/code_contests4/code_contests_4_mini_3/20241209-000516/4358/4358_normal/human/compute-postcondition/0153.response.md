The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since `j` is 5, the value of `p[i]` will be set to whatever the value of `p[5]` is. The variable `tmp` retains its previous value, which was assigned from `p[i]` before this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 5; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`; `p[i]` is now assigned the value of `p[j]` (where `j` is 5).

Output State: **`j` is 5; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`; `p[i]` is now assigned the value of `p[j]` (where `j` is 5)**.
