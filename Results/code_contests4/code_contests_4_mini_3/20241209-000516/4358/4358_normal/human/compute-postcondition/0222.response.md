The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since `j` is 3, `p[i]` will now take the value of `p[3]`. The previous value of `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, but we do not know the specific values of `p[i]` and `p[j]`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, `p[j]` remains unchanged, `a[i][j]` is 1, `a[j][i]` is 1, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` is 1, `a[j][i]` is 1, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before this operation.**
