The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The state of `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `s` is updated to include the string representation of `p[0]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `s` is updated to include the string representation of `p[0]` followed by a space.**
