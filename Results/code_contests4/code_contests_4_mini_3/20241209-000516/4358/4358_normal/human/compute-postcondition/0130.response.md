The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The values of `i`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged, as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 5, and `if p[i] is greater than p[j], then if a[i][j] and a[j][i] are both equal to 1, p[4] is assigned the value of p[1]; otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 5, and if `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then if `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, `p[4]` is assigned the value of `p[1]`; otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.**
