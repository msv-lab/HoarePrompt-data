After analyzing the provided code and the output states after the first few iterations, we can derive the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

The outer while loop continues until `i` is no longer less than `n`. Given that `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 on each iteration, once the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`. The inner while loop, which initializes `j` to `i + 1`, will also run until `j` is no longer less than `n`. 

Since the outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`, it will execute a total of `n` times, incrementing `i` to `n` after the last iteration. The variable `j` will be set back to `n` at the end of each outer iteration, and thus after the final outer loop iteration, `j` will also take the value of `n`.

The original value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

The state of `p` may or may not change based on the conditions inside the inner loops, but since the output states after the first three iterations indicate that `p` remains unchanged, we conclude it remains unchanged after all iterations.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations have completed is as follows:

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.**
