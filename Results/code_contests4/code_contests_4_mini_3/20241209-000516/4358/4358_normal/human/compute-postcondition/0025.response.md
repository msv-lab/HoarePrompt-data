The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `j` is 3, `s` is a non-empty string, and `b` contains either [1, 1] if `s[3]` is '1', or it now contains the previous elements plus an additional `0` if `s[3]` is not '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `j` is 3, `s` is a non-empty string, and `b` contains either [1, 1] if `s[3]` is '1', or it now contains the previous elements plus an additional `0` if `s[3]` is not '1'.**
