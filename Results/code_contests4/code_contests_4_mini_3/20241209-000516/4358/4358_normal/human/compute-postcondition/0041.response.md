In this case, `b` is being appended with the value 1. The previous state of `n` and `j` remains unchanged, and the code does not provide information about the current state of the list `b`. Since `b` is being modified but its previous state is not known, we can only mention that an element has been added to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 1; `b` has 1 appended to it.**
