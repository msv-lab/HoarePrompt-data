`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `j` becomes 2. The values of `n`, `p[0]`, and `p[1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged.**
