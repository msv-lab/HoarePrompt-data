According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is greater than 2. Since `j` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 3**
