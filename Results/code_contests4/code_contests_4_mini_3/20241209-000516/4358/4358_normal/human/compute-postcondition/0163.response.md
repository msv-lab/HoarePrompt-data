The value of `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, the value of `j` becomes 0 + 1, which is 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and the state of `p` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged**.
