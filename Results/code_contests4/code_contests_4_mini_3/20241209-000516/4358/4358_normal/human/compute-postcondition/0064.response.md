According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of the string `s`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `s` is a non-empty string, which means `len(s)` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, we need `j` to be less than `len(s)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is less than the length of `s`. 

If `s` is at least 2 characters long, then `j` being 1 will be valid for another iteration. However, if `s` has only 1 character, then `j` is not less than the length of `s`. So, to guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to state that `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

State: **`j` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string, and for the loop to execute again `len(s)` must be greater than 1**.
