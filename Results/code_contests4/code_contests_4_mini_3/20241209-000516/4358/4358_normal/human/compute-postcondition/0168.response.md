The value at index `j` in array `p` is assigned to the value at index `i` in array `p`. Since it is given that the value at index `i` in array `p` is greater than the value at index `j` in array `p`, the value at `p[i]` will now be equal to the previous value of `p[j]`. The previous value at `p[i]` will be replaced with the value from `p[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the value at index `i` in array `p` is now equal to the value at index `j` in array `p` (which is less than the previous value of `p[i]`), and `tmp` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the value at index `i` in array `p` is now equal to the value at index `j` in array `p`, `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` in array `p`.**
