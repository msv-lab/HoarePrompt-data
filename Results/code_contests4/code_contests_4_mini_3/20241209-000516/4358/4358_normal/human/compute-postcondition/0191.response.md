According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is 2, and `n` is the original value of `n`. To ensure that the loop can execute one time, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 2**
