According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2, since `j` is currently 2. Therefore, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2**
