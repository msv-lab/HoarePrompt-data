The code `b.append(1)` appends the integer 1 to the list `b`. The previous value of `b` is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `s[1]`. After executing this line, `b` will contain an additional element, making it either [1, 1] or [0, 1]. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 2; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` is either [1, 1] or [0, 1].

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 2; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` is either [1, 1] or [0, 1]**
