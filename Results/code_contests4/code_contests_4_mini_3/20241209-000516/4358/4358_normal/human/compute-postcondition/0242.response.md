The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `i` is 2, after execution, `i` becomes 3. The values of `j` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 2**
