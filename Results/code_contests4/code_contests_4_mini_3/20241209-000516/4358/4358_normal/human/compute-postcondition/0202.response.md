`p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `p[1]` will take the value of `p[3]`. The other variables, `j`, `tmp`, and `n`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is `p[1]`, and now `p[1]` is equal to `p[3]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is `p[1]`, and now `p[1]` is equal to `p[3]`**.
