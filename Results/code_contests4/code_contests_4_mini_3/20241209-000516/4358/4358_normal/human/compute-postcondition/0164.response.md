According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is 1 and `n` is the original value of `n`. 

Since `j` is currently 1, to ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 1. This means that the original value of `n` needs to be at least 2 for the loop to execute one time. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time then n must be greater than 1**
