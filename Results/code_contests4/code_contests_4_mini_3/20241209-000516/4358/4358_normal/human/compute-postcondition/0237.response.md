The value of `tmp` is assigned from `p[2]`, which is currently equal to `p[5]` (an unknown value). When we execute `p[j] = tmp`, we are assigning the value of `tmp` to `p[5]`. Therefore, `p[5]` will now hold the value originally present at `p[2]`. The states of the other variables, `i` and `j`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 5, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[2]`, and `p[5]` is now equal to `tmp`.**
