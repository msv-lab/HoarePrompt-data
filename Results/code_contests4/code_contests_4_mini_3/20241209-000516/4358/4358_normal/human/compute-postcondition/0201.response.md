The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The variable `i` is 1, so `tmp` takes the value of `p[1]`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is `p[1]`, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 3.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is `p[1]`, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 3**
