`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `j` becomes 3. The state of `i` remains unaffected, and the condition regarding `n` being greater than 2 is not directly impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2**
