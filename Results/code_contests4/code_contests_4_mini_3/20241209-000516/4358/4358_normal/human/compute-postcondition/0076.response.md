The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The other variables `j`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to the length of the string `s`, `b` contains a list of integers corresponding to the characters in `s`, `s` remains unchanged, variable `i` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`j` is equal to the length of the string `s`, `b` contains a list of integers corresponding to the characters in `s`, `s` remains unchanged, variable `i` is increased by 1.**
