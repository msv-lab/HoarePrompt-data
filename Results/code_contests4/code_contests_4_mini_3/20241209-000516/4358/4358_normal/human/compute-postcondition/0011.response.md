The value `1` is appended to the list `b`. The previous value of `b` is an empty list, so after the execution of the code, `b` becomes `[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `b` is [1]; `s` is a non-empty string; the character at index `j` of `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `b` is [1]; `s` is a non-empty string; the character at index `j` of `s` is '1'**
