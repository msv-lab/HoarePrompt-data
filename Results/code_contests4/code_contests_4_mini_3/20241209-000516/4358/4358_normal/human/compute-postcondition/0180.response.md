According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 3**
