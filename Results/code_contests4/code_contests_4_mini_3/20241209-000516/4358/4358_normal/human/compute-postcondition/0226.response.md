The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The previous value of `j` is 3, so after execution, `j` will be 4. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `n` is greater than 3.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `n` is greater than 3**
