The value of `i` is assigned the value `0`, regardless of its previous value, which was `n`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.**
