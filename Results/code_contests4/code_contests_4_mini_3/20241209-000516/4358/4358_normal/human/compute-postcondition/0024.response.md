Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `j` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string, and `b` contains either [1, 1] if `s[j]` is '1', or it now contains the previous elements plus an additional `0` if `s[j]` is not '1'.***
