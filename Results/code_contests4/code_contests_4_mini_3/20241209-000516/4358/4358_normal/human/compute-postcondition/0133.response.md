According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is the original value of `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must remain less than `n`. Since `j` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, `n` has not changed and is still equal to its original value. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.**
