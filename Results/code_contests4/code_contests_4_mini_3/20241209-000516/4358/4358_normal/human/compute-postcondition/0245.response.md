The variable `s` is assigned an empty string `''`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, and `p`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged; `s` is an empty string.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged; `s` is an empty string.**
