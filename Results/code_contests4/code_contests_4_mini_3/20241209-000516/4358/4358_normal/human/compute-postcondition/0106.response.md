According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the original value of `n`. Since `i` (1) is less than `n` (original value), the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged**.
