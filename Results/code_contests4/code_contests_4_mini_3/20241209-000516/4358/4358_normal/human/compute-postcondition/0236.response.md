The code `p[i] = p[j]` assigns the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 5, this means that `p[2]` will now hold the value of `p[5]`. The value of `p[5]` is unknown, but it will replace whatever value `p[2]` had previously. The other variables `i`, `j`, and `tmp` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[2]`, and `p[2]` is now equal to `p[5]` (unknown value).

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 5, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[2]`, and `p[2]` is now equal to `p[5]` (unknown value).**
