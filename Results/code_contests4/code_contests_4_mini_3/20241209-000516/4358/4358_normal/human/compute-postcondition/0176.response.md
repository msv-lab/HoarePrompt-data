The code assigns the value of `tmp` to `p[j]`. The variable `j` is 2, so `p[2]` will be updated to the value of `tmp`. However, the value of `tmp` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only note that the value of `p[2]` is changing based on `tmp`, which is unknown.

The states of the other variables, `i` and `j`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2; `p[2]` is updated to the value of `tmp` (unknown)**.
