Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the value of `p[0]` is greater than the value of `p[1]`. If `a[0][1]` and `a[1][0]` are both equal to 1, then `p[0]` is now equal to `p[1]`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[1]` is updated to the value of `tmp`. Otherwise, the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged.***
