The code attempts to assign a value to `p[j]`, where `p` is undefined. Since `p` has not been assigned any value, this operation cannot be performed, and no changes occur to the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and notes the issue with the assignment. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `p` is undefined, assignment to `p[j]` is not possible.**
