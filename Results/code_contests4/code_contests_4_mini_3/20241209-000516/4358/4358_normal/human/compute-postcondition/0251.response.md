The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The variable `s` remains unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `s` is updated to include `str(p[1])` followed by a space.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is updated to include `str(p[1])` followed by a space**
