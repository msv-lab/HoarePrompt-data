According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is greater than 2. Since `j` (3) is not less than `n` (which must be at least 3, as `n` is greater than 2), the loop will not execute again without adjustments.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 3**
