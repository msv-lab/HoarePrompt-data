According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 4**
