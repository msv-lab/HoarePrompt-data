The value at index `j` of array `p` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which was previously assigned the value at index `i` of array `p`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, after the execution, the new value at index `j` will be the same as the value at index `i`. The states of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `tmp` has a specific value that corresponds to `p[i]` before the assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `tmp` is the value at index 1 of array `p`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `tmp`.**
