The variable `a` is assigned an empty list, but this does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list.**
