The code `b.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `b`. The initial state does not provide any information about the variable `b`, but we can assume `b` is an empty list or already exists. However, since the initial state does not indicate any previous values for `b`, we will consider the impact of the code on the program without altering other variables.

Since `j` is 0 and `s` is a non-empty string with its first character as '1', these values remain unchanged. The output state will include the fact that `1` has been appended to `b`.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, and `1` has been appended to `b`.**
