The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`. Since `p[1]` is now equal to `p[4]`, `tmp` holds the value of `p[4]`. The line `p[j] = tmp` assigns the value of `tmp` to `p[j]`, which means `p[4]` will be updated to the value stored in `tmp`. Other variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `tmp` is equal to `p[4]`, and `p[4]` is updated to `p[4]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `tmp` is equal to `p[4]`, and `p[4]` is updated to `p[4]**.
