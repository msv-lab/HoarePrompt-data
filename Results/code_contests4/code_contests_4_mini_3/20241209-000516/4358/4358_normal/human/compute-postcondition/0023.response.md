The code `b.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `b`. The initial state indicates that `b` can either contain the value `1` or `0` depending on the value of `s[1]`, but it does not specify the exact current contents of `b`. Therefore, after executing the code, `b` will include `0` as an additional element.

Since we do not have specifics about the current contents of `b`, the output state must reflect that `0` has been appended to whatever `b` previously contained.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 2; `s` is a non-empty string; `b` now contains the previous elements plus an additional `0`.**
