The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, this means `p[0]` will take on the value of `p[1]`. The previous values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` are not specified, but we know that `p[0]` will now equal `p[1]`. The other variables `j`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the value of `p[0]` is now equal to the value of `p[1]`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`.**
