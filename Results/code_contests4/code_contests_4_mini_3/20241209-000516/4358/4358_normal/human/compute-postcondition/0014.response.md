Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `s` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j` of `s` is '1', then `b` is set to [1]. Otherwise, if the character at index `j` of `s` is not '1', then `b` is set to [0].***
