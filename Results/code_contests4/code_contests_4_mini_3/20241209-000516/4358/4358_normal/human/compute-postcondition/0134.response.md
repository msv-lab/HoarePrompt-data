The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the calculation results in `j` being 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `p` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.**
