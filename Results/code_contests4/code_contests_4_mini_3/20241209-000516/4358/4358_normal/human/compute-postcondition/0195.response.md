The value at index `j` of array `p` is assigned to index `i` of array `p`. The previous value of `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, so after execution, `p[i]` will now hold the value of `p[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, the value at index `i` of array `p` is now equal to the value at index `j` of array `p`, `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` of array `p` before the assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, the value at index `i` of array `p` is now equal to the value at index `j` of array `p`, `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` of array `p` before the assignment.**
