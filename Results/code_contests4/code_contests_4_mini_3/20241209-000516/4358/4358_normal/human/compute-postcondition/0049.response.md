The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables `n` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 3; `b` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 3; `b` is unchanged.**
