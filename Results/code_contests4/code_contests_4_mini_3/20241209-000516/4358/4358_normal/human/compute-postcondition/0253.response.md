The variable `s` is being concatenated with the string representation of `p[i]`, where `i` is 2. The value of `i` is 2, but the value of `p[i]` is unknown as the contents of the list `p` are not provided. However, the operation will append the string representation of `p[2]` followed by a space to `s`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `s` is concatenated with `str(p[2]) + ' '`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is concatenated with `str(p[2]) + ' '`**
