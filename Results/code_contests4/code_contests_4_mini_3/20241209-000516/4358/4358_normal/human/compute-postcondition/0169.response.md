`p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is previously assigned the value at index `i` in array `p`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, this means that `p[1]` will now hold the value of `p[0]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the value at index `i` in array `p` is equal to the value at index `j` in array `p`, `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` in array `p`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the value at index `i` in array `p` is equal to the value at index `j` in array `p`, `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` in array `p`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[i]`.**
