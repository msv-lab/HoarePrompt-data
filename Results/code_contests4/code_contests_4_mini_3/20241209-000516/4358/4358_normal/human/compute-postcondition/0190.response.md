`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `j` will be 2. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the state of `p` remains unchanged**.
