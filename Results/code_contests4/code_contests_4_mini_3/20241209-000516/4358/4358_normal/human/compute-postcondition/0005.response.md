According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300. Since `i` is 0, it is indeed less than any positive integer `n` within the given range. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list.**
