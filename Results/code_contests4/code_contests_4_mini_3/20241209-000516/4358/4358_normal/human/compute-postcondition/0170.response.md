Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the value at index `i` in array `p` is greater than the value at index `j` in array `p`. If `a[i][j]` is 1 and `a[j][i]` is 1, then `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` in array `p`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[i]`. If the condition is not met, there are no changes to the values of `tmp` or `p`.***
