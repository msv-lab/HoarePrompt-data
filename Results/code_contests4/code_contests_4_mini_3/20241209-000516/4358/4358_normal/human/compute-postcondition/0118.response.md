The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. However, the variable `p` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the value of `tmp`. The other variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, which is undefined.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, which is undefined.**
