The value of `j` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, so `n` is still a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 0, and `a` is an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0**
