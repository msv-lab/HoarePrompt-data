The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing `i` from 0 to 1. The values of `j`, `n`, and `p[0]`, `p[1]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `i` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and the values of `p[0]` and `p[1]` remain unchanged**.
