According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, and `n` is greater than 3. The condition `j < n` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute again. Since `j` is 4, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4. 

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 4**
