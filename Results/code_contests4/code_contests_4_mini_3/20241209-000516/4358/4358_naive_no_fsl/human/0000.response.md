To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation in the code.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the prettiest permutation of a given permutation `p` based on the allowed swaps defined by an `n x n` binary matrix `A`. A permutation is considered prettier if it is lexicographically smaller than another permutation with a certain condition met.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code reads the size of the permutation `n` and the permutation itself.
   - It constructs the adjacency matrix `A` from input.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The code attempts to sort the permutation `p` using allowed swaps based on the matrix `A`. 
   - There are two nested loops that check if `p[i] > p[j]` and whether a swap is allowed (`a[i][j] == 1` and `a[j][i] == 1`).

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

### Issues with the Code
- **Inefficient Sorting Logic**: The algorithm does not guarantee that it will always produce the lexicographically smallest permutation. The double loop structure could lead to missing valid swaps if they are not done in a specific order.
- **Incorrect Swap Conditions**: The logic checks for `p[i] > p[j]` and only swaps if both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are `1`. This condition is overly strict and may prevent valid swaps from being executed.

### Potential Case Where It Fails
Consider the following input:
```
3
3 2 1
001
000
000
```
Here, no swaps are allowed according to the matrix (since all off-diagonal elements are `0`). The expected output should be `1 2 3`, but since no swaps can occur, the output will remain `3 2 1`, which is not the prettiest permutation.

### Conclusion
Based on the reasoning and the identified failing case, we conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
