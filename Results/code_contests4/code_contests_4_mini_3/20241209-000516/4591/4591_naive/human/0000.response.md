Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the algorithm to approximate the cube root of a positive integer \( q \) using the recurrence formula provided. It initializes \( x \) to \( \frac{q}{2} \) and iteratively updates \( x \) until the condition \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 q \) is satisfied. The program handles multiple datasets until it encounters -1, which indicates the termination of input. 

The output format is also correct, as it prints the result with six decimal places, ensuring that the precision requirement of an error of 0.00001 or less is met. Given the constraints on \( q \) (positive integers less than \( 2^{31} \)), the program operates correctly within the specified limits. 

No edge cases or potential failures have been identified that would lead to incorrect behavior of the program based on the problem description.
