The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is an integer; `diff` is a positive float computed as `q * 1e-05`; `x` is updated to `x - (x` where the absolute value of `x` cubed minus `q` is less than `diff` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
