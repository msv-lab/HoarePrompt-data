According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute at least one time since the condition is always true. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute. 

State: **`abs(x)` is printed formatted to six decimal places, `q` is an integer value taken from `line`, `x` is assigned the value `q / 2.0`, `diff` is assigned the value `q * 1e-05`**
