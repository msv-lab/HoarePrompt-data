Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless explicitly terminated by a break statement or some other condition. Therefore, there are no conditions that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is the updated value after the calculation; `diff` is a positive float**
