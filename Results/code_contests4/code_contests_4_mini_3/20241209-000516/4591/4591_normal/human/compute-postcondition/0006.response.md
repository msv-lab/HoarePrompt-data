`diff` is assigned the value of `q * 1e-05`. The value of `q` is a positive integer, so `diff` will also be a positive float. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer; `x` is the result of `q / 2.0` which is a positive float; `diff` is a positive float calculated as `q * 1e-05`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is the result of `q / 2.0` which is a positive float; `diff` is a positive float calculated as `q * 1e-05`**
