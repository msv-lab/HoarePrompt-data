The value of `x` is assigned the result of `q / 2.0`. Given that `q` is a positive integer, the value of `x` will be a positive float. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer; `x` is the result of `q / 2.0` which is a positive float.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is the result of `q / 2.0` which is a positive float.**
