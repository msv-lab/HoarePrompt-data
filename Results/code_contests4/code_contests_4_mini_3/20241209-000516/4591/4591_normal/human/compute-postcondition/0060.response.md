The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `abs(x)` is printed formatted to six decimal places, `q` is an integer value taken from `line`, `x` is updated based on the calculation `x = x - (x`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
