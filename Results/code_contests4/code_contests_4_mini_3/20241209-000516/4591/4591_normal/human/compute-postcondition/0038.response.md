The value of `x` is updated using the formula `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`. The current value of `q` is an integer, and `diff` is a positive float computed as `q * 1e-05`. The previous value of `x` is unknown, but it will be modified by the equation provided. After performing the calculation with the given formula, the value of `x` will change accordingly, but without a specific initial value for `x`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `x`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `x` based on the equation.

Output State: **`q` is an integer, `diff` is a positive float computed as `q * 1e-05`, and `x` is updated based on the equation `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`**.
