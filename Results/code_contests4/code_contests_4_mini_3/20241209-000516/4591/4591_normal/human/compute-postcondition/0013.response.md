In the provided code, `x` is updated based on the formula given. The expression `(x ** 3 - q)` is calculated first, which represents the difference between the cube of `x` and the value of `q`. This difference is then divided by `(3 * x * x)`, which is three times the square of `x`. The result of this division is subtracted from the current value of `x`.

Given that `q` is a positive integer, `x` is the updated value after the calculation, and `diff` is a positive float (though it is not directly involved in this calculation), we can summarize the changes:

1. The new value of `x` is calculated.
2. The previous value of `x` is not directly specified but is involved in the computation.
3. The value of `q` is known to be a positive integer.

After performing the calculations, the output will reflect the updated state of `x` based on the provided formula.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is the updated value after the calculation; `diff` is a positive float.**
