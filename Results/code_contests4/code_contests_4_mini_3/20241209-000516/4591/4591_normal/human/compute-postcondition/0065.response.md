The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple positive integers from standard input, with -1 indicating the end of the input. After processing the inputs, the function returns a collection of results based on the valid positive integers provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle a sequence of positive integers from standard input, terminating when -1 is encountered, and return results based on those integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple positive integers from standard input, terminating on -1, and returns results based on the valid integers provided.**
