The code assigns the value of `q * 1e-05` to `diff`. Since `diff` remains a positive float and its previous state was not provided, we can determine that `diff` will now be a small positive float based on the integer value of `q`. The output state does not change `q` and `diff` is now a positive float derived from `q`. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is an integer; `diff` is a positive float computed as `q * 1e-05`.

Output State: **`q` is an integer; `diff` is a positive float computed as `q * 1e-05**
