To determine the new state after executing the code provided, we analyze the impact of the calculation performed.

1. The variable `x` is updated using the formula: 
   \[
   x = x - \frac{(x^3 - q)}{(3 \cdot x^2)}
   \]
2. The previous value of `x` is noted as the updated value after the calculation, and the value of `q` is given as a positive integer. 
3. The operation involves calculating \( x^3 \) and \( 3 \cdot x^2 \) which depend on the current value of `x`.
4. The expression \((x^3 - q)\) is computed next. As `q` is a positive integer, the result will affect how `x` is updated.
5. Finally, the updated value of `x` is determined after the computation.

Since the exact values of `x` and `q` aren't specified, we can summarize the output state based on the operations performed.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is updated after the calculation; `diff` is a positive float.**
