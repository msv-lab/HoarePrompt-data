The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `abs(x)` is printed formatted to six decimal places, `q` is an integer value taken from `line`, `x` is updated based on the calculation, `diff` is assigned the value `q * 1e-05`, and the absolute value of `x` cubed minus `q` is less than `diff`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
