Since the `while` loop condition is `True`, the loop will always execute regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute. 

State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is the result of `q / 2.0` which is a positive float; `diff` is a positive float calculated as `q * 1e-05`**
