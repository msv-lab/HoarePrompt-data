In this case, the `while` loop is structured as `while True`, which means that it is designed to run indefinitely unless a break condition is encountered within the loop body. Since the loop can certainly execute one more time without any conditions that would prevent it from doing so, there is no need to adjust any states.

State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is the updated value after the calculation; `diff` is a positive float.**
