The code prints the value of `x` formatted to six decimal places. Since `x` is approximately the cube root of `q`, its specific value is not provided, but it is determined based on the initial state of `q`. The variable `diff` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is approximately the cube root of `q`; `diff` is a positive float; and the value of `x` is printed formatted to six decimal places.**
