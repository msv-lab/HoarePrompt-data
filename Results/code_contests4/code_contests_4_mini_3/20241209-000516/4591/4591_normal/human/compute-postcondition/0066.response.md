Functionality: ** The function reads multiple positive integers from standard input until it encounters -1, which signals the termination of input. For each positive integer `q`, it calculates the cube root of `q` using an iterative method and prints the result formatted to six decimal places. The function does not return any value; it simply outputs the cube roots for each valid integer input. **
