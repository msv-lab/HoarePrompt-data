Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer, `diff` is a positive float computed as `q * 1e-05`. If the absolute value of `x` cubed minus `q` is less than `diff`, then `x` is updated to `x - (x`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.***
