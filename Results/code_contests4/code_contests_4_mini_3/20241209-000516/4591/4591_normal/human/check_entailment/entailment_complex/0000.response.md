Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem description for approximating the cube root of a positive integer \( q \).

Here's an explanation of why the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple positive integers from standard input until it encounters -1, which is the termination signal. This correctly follows the input constraints specified in the problem description.

2. **Initial Guess**: The program initializes \( x \) to \( \frac{q}{2} \), which is in line with the problem description that suggests starting with this value.

3. **Recurrence Formula**: The program implements the recurrence formula \( x_{n + 1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2} \) within a while loop. This is correctly handling the iterative calculation of cube roots as required.

4. **Stopping Condition**: The stopping condition checks if \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \cdot q \), which is consistent with the problem's requirement for determining when the approximation is "small enough."

5. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs the result formatted to six decimal places, aligning with the output requirements.

Overall, the structure of the program, its logic, and the calculations align with the problem description, ensuring that it will provide the correct approximation of the cube root of \( q \) for the given range of inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
