Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement for approximating the cube root of a positive integer \( q \). Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple lines of input until it encounters `-1`, which signals the end of input. Each line is expected to contain a positive integer \( q \), which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes \( x \) to \( \frac{q}{2} \), following the requirement to start the approximation with a positive number.

3. **Recurrence Formula**: The loop implements the recurrence formula correctly:
   \[
   x_{n + 1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2}
   \]
   This is the correct update for each iteration of the approximation process, allowing \( x \) to converge towards the cube root of \( q \).

4. **Stopping Condition**: The program checks if the absolute difference \( |x^3 - q| \) is less than \( 0.00001 \times q \) to determine when to stop the iteration. This condition matches the requirement outlined in the problem description.

5. **Output Format**: The final result is printed formatted to six decimal places, which is suitable given the required precision of \( 0.00001 \).

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description, ensuring that it approximates the cube root correctly for the given positive integers \( q \). Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
