Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the method for approximating the cube root of a positive integer \( q \) based on the recurrence formula given in the problem description. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by setting \( x_1 = \frac{q}{2} \), which is in line with the problem's requirement to begin the approximation with a positive number.

2. **Recurrence Formula**: It correctly applies the recurrence formula \( x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2} \) within a `while` loop, which continues until the condition \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \cdot q \) is met.

3. **Stopping Condition**: The stopping condition is accurately implemented as \( abs(x^3 - q) < diff \), where \( diff \) is defined as \( q \cdot 1e-05 \), adhering to the problem's specification.

4. **Output Formatting**: Finally, the output is formatted correctly to six decimal places, which ensures precision in the result.

5. **Multiple Datasets Handling**: The program handles multiple datasets as described, reading until it encounters `-1`, and processes each positive integer `q` correctly.

Given these points, all potential edge cases and the specified requirements of the problem description are satisfied by this implementation. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
