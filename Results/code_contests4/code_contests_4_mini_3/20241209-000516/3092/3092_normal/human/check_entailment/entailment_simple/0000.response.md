The provided program attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of character changes required to make all substrings of a given string distinct. However, it does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. 

Here's an analysis of the program:

1. **Understanding Distinct Substrings**: The problem states that if any substrings of a string are not distinct, Kerem wants to make them distinct by changing characters. The program simplifies this to checking if the length of the string is greater than 26 (the number of distinct lowercase English letters). If the string has more than 26 characters, it immediately concludes that it's impossible to make all substrings distinct by returning -1, which is not necessarily true. 

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Changes**: The program calculates the number of changes needed as `n - len(set(s))` only when `n <= 26`. This logic assumes that the only issue with duplicates is the characters themselves, and if there are repeated characters, it calculates how many characters are duplicates. However, this does not consider the structure of substrings and the possibility of having multiple duplicates in combinations, which can lead to many substrings being the same, not just the individual characters.

3. **Missing Cases**: For strings longer than 26 characters, the program returns -1 without further analysis. This is incorrect because it is possible to change certain characters to make substrings distinct even if `n > 26`, as long as sufficient character changes can be made.

4. **Final Output**: The program does not account for all necessary changes to ensure all substrings are distinct, nor does it correctly handle the case where it is possible to achieve this under certain conditions.

In conclusion, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to its oversimplified approach and incorrect handling of cases involving string lengths greater than 26. 

Correctness: **False**
