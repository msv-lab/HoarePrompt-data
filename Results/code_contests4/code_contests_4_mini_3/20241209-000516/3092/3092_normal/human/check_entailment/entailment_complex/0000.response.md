The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Let's analyze the program step-by-step against the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. This part is correct as it follows the input format.

2. **Distinct Substrings Requirement**: The goal is to ensure all substrings of `s` are distinct. The program attempts to address this by checking if `n` (the length of the string) is less than or equal to 26. The reasoning is that there are 26 distinct lowercase letters, and a string longer than this necessarily must have repeated characters (which implies repeated substrings).

3. **Calculating Changes**: 
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the program calculates the number of changes needed as `n - len(set(s))`. This is incorrect. While `len(set(s))` counts unique characters, the number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct is not simply the count of duplicates in `s`. For example, a string like "aa" would require one change to become distinct, but `len(set("aa"))` would return 1, leading to an incorrect result of `1 - 1 = 0`, which is incorrect.
   - If `n` is greater than 26, the program correctly outputs `-1`, as it is impossible to have all unique substrings when there are more characters than distinct letters available.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to consider various edge cases that could arise, such as:
   - How to handle strings with multiple duplicates that require more than one character change to achieve distinct substrings.
   - It doesn't account for cases where the string might already be distinct but is longer than 26 characters.

5. **Conclusion**: The logic used to calculate the number of changes is flawed. The program does not provide a correct solution for all possible cases as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the output for any string of length `n` less than or equal to 26 is not guaranteed to be correct, leading to potential miscalculations.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
