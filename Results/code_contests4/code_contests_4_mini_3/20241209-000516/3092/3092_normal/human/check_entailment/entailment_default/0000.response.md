Let's analyze the provided program in relation to the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description Summary:
- The goal is to ensure that all substrings of a given string `s` are distinct.
- If there are duplicates in the string, we need to determine the minimum number of changes required to achieve distinct substrings.
- If it's impossible to achieve this (i.e., if the length of the string exceeds 26, because there are only 26 lowercase letters), we should return -1.

### Provided Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = raw_input()
    if n <= 26:
        result = n - len(set(s))
    else:
        result = -1
    print(str(result))
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The code takes an integer `n` and a string `s`.
2. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 26:
   - If true, it calculates the number of changes required as `n - len(set(s))`, which represents the number of duplicate characters in the string.
   - If false, it directly returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to have distinct substrings because there are not enough unique characters to replace duplicates.
3. Finally, it prints the result.

### Output Hints:
- The hints state that the function prints the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s` if `n` is less than or equal to 26.
- If `n` is greater than 26, it prints -1. 
- It also mentions that the function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or where `s` contains characters outside the lowercase English letters.

### Evaluation of the Code Against the Problem Description:
The core logic of the program seems to align with the requirement of determining the minimum number of changes if `n` is less than or equal to 26. However, there are a few considerations:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where `s` contains characters outside the lowercase English letters. However, the problem states that `s` consists of only lowercase English letters, which means this might not be a concern based on the given constraints.
  
2. **Calculation of Changes**: The calculation `n - len(set(s))` effectively determines the number of duplicates, which is correct for producing the minimum changes necessary to make the substrings distinct.

3. **Maximum Length Constraint**: The program correctly identifies that if `n > 26`, it is impossible to achieve distinct substrings, given that there are only 26 letters to work with.

### Conclusion:
Since the code correctly implements the logic laid out in the problem description, and the output hints accurately reflect the program's functionality without contradicting it, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
