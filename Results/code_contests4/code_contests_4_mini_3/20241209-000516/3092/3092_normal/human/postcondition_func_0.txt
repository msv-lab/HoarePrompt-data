The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase English letters. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates and prints the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s`. If `n` is greater than 26, it prints -1. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or where `s` contains characters outside the lowercase English letters.
