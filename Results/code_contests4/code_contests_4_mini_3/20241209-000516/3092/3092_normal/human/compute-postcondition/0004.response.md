To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state:

1. The variable `s` is a string input, and `len(set(s))` calculates the number of unique characters in the string `s`.
2. The variable `n` is an integer input which is within the range 1 to 100,000 and is less than or equal to 26, meaning that `n` can only take values from 1 to 26.
3. `result` is assigned the value of `n - len(set(s))`, which means we subtract the count of unique characters in `s` from `n`.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `s`, and `result` after this operation is performed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input within the range 1 to 26, `s` is a new string input, and `result` is `n - len(set(s))`**.
