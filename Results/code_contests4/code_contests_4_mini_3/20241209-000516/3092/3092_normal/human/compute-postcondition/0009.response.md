Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase English letters. If `n` is between 1 and 26, the variable `result` is calculated as `n - len(set(s))`. If `n` is greater than 26, `result` is set to -1. The value of `result` is printed as a string.***
