Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

1. The program checks if the length of the string `n` is less than or equal to 26. If it is, it calculates the number of changes needed as `n - len(set(s))`, which counts how many characters are duplicates in the string by comparing the size of the set (which contains only distinct characters) to the original length `n`. This logic is flawed in the context of ensuring all substrings are distinct.

2. The program outputs `-1` if `n` is greater than 26, suggesting that it's impossible to make all substrings distinct due to the limited number of lowercase English letters. However, it does not consider that even strings with `n <= 26` may still have duplicate substrings that need to be addressed beyond just counting duplicate characters.

3. A critical case where the program fails is when `n` is 2 and `s` is "aa". The expected output is 1, as one change is needed to make the substrings distinct. The program would correctly output 1 in this case, but it would incorrectly output for other cases where distinct substrings can be achieved without a simple counting of duplicates. 

For example, for the input:
```
4
koko
```
The number of distinct characters is 3 ('k', 'o'), while `n` is 4. The expected minimum number of changes needed should be 2 to ensure all substrings are distinct, but the program does not correctly account for that, outputting `1` instead.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases of ensuring distinct substrings properly.
