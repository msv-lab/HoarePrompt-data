Output State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 2 elements; `sum` is updated by adding the value of `i` when the condition is met; `k` is the second element in `K`; `i` is the smallest integer such that either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`; `sum` is updated to `sum + i`.**
