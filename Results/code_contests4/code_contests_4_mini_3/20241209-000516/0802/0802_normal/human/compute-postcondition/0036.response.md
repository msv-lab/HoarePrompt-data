Postcondition: ***`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 2 elements; if `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`, then `sum` is updated by adding the value of `i`, `k` is the second element in `K`, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
