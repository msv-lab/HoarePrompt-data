The variable `i` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables (`S`, `K`, `sum`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the set of sorted elements from input[3:3 + n - 1] including 0, `K` is the list of elements from input[3 + n - 1:] with at least 1 element, `sum` is initialized to 0, `k` is the first element in K, and `i` is 1.
