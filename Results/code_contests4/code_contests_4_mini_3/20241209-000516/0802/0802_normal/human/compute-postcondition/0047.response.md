In this case, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely until some condition within the loop body leads to a break. Because it will always execute again regardless of the current state, there is no need to adjust any variables.

State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 3 elements; `k` is the third element in `K`; `i` is 2; `sum` remains unchanged**.
