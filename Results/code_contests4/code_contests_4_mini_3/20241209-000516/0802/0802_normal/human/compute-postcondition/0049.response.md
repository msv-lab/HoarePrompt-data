Postcondition: ***`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 3 elements; `k` is the third element in `K`; `i` is 2; `sum` remains unchanged. If either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
