According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `K`. If `K` contains at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `sum` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `K` must contain at least 1 element, and `k` will be set to the first element of the list `K` during the first iteration.

State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from input[3:3 + n - 1] including 0, `K` is the list of elements from input[3 + n - 1:] with at least 1 element, `sum` is initialized to 0, `k` is the first element in K**
