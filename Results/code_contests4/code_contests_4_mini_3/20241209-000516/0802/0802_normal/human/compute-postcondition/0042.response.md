Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to modify any of the states for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 3 elements; `k` is the third element in `K`; `i` is 1; `sum` remains unchanged.**
