Output State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]`; `sum` is updated to the total sum of all `i` values calculated for each element in `K`; `k` is the last element in `K`; `i` is the smallest integer such that either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S` for the last element processed; if `K` is empty, `sum` remains 0.**
