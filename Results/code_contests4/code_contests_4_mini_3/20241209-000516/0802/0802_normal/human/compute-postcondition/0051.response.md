According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always be able to execute again regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 3 elements; `k` is the third element in `K`; `i` is 3; `sum` remains unchanged.**
