The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 2 elements; `sum` is updated by adding the value of `i`; `k` is the second element in `K`; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
