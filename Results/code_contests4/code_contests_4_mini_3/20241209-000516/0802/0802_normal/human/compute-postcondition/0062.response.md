Functionality: ** The function reads input from a file containing the total length of a delivery route, the number of stores, and the number of delivery orders. It calculates the minimum distance required for each order to reach a store that is positioned in specific locations relative to the delivery destination, specifically checking for proximity in a modulo 8 context. The results are summed and written to an output file. The function processes input until a termination condition (when d equals 0), at which point it stops reading and processing. If no valid stores exist or no deliveries are required, the output will reflect that with a sum of 0. **
