The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 2 elements; `sum` is updated by adding the value of `i`; `k` is the second element in `K`; `i` is 3.
