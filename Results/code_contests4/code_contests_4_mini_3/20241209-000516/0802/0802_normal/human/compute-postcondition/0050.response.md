The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The values of `S`, `K`, `k`, and `sum` remain unchanged. The code does not affect the condition regarding breaking out of any loops or if statements. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 3 elements; `k` is the third element in `K`; `i` is 3; `sum` remains unchanged.
