The variable `sum` is initialized to `0`, but no other variables are affected by this code snippet. The previous values of `S` and `K` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the set of sorted elements from input[3:3 + n - 1] including 0, `K` is the list of elements from input[3 + n - 1:], and `sum` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from input[3:3 + n - 1] including 0, `K` is the list of elements from input[3 + n - 1:], `sum` is initialized to 0**
