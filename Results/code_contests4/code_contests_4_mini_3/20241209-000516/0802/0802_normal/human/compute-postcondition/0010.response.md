The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0, `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 1 element, `sum` is initialized to 0, `k` is the first element in `K`, `i` is 1, and either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is an element of `S`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
