Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0; `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 2 elements; `sum` is updated by adding the value of `i`; `k` is the second element in `K`; `i` is 1.**
