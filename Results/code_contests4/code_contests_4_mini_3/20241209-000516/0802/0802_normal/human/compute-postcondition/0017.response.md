According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to execute indefinitely unless a break condition is met. Therefore, there are no specific conditions that need to be adjusted in the program state for the loop to continue executing. 

State: **`S` is the set of sorted elements from `input[3:3 + n - 1]` including 0, `K` is the list of elements from `input[3 + n - 1:]` with at least 1 element, `sum` is initialized to 0, `k` is the first element in `K`, `i` is increased by 1, and if either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
