You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: problem

JOI Pizza sells pizza home delivery along the d-meter-long ring road that runs through the city center.

JOI Pizza has n stores S1, ..., Sn on the loop line. The head office is S1. The distance from S1 to Si when moving the loop line clockwise is set to di meters. D2 , ..., dn is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to d -1. D2, ..., dn are all different. Bake and deliver pizza at the shortest store.

The location of the delivery destination is represented by an integer k that is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to d -1. This means that the distance from the head office S1 to the delivery destination in the clockwise direction is k meters. Pizza delivery is done along the loop line and no other road is allowed. However, the loop line may move clockwise or counterclockwise.

For example, if the location of the store and the location of the delivery destination are as shown in the figure below (this example corresponds to Example 1 of "I / O example").


<image>


The store closest to the delivery destination 1 is S2, so the delivery is from store S2. At this time, the distance traveled from the store is 1. Also, the store closest to delivery destination 2 is S1 (main store), so store S1 (main store). ) To deliver to home. At this time, the distance traveled from the store is 2.

Total length of the loop line d, Number of JOI pizza stores n, Number of orders m, N --1 integer representing a location other than the main store d2, ..., dn, Integer k1, .. representing the location of the delivery destination Given ., km, create a program to find the sum of all orders for each order by the distance traveled during delivery (ie, the distance from the nearest store to the delivery destination).



input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format.

The first line is a positive integer d (2 ≤ d ≤ 1000000000 = 109) that represents the total length of the loop line, the second line is a positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) that represents the number of stores, and the third line is A positive integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000) is written to represent the number of orders. The n --1 lines after the 4th line are integers d2, d3, ..., dn that represent the location of stores other than the main store. (1 ≤ di ≤ d -1) is written in this order, and the integers k1, k2, ..., km (0 ≤ ki ≤ d) representing the delivery destination location are in the m lines after the n + 3rd line. --1) are written in this order.

Of the scoring data, for 40% of the points, n ≤ 10000 is satisfied. For 40% of the points, the total distance traveled and the value of d are both 1000000 or less. In the scoring data, the total distance traveled is 1000000000 = 109 or less.

When d is 0, it indicates the end of input. The number of data sets does not exceed 10.

output

For each data set, one integer representing the total distance traveled during delivery is output on one line.

(S, K) = (set(sorted([0] + input[3:3 + n - 1])), input[3 + n - 1:])
sum = 0
for k in K:
    i = 1
    while True:
        if (k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S:
            break
        i += 1
    sum += i
f = open('output.txt', 'w')
f.write(str(sum))
f.close()
```
Output hints: The function reads input from a file containing the total length of a delivery route, the number of stores, and the number of delivery orders. It calculates the minimum distance required for each order to reach a store that is positioned in specific locations relative to the delivery destination, specifically checking for proximity in a modulo 8 context. The results are summed and written to an output file. The function processes input until a termination condition (when d equals 0), at which point it stops reading and processing. If no valid stores exist or no deliveries are required, the output will reflect that with a sum of 0.

First I want you to try to see if the code does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code must exactly follow the problem description for all cases to be correct.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
