Postcondition: ***`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `s` is the original input string. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', the printed output is '/'. Otherwise, `cur` contains valid segments from `s`, excluding any segments that are '..', `i` is the number of segments processed in `s`, and `s` remains unchanged.***
