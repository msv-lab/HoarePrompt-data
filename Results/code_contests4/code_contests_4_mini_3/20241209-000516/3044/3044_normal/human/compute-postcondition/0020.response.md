Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list that contains `x` if `x` is not equal to '..'; if `x` equals '..', `cur` is updated to remove its last element. Otherwise, `cur` now contains `x` appended to its previous values. In both cases, `i` is 1, and `s` contains enough characters to generate more substrings after splitting by '/' for the loop to execute a second time.***
