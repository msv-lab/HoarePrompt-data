Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list that may remain empty if `x` is equal to '..'. If `x` is equal to '..', no new elements are added to `cur`, while if `x` is not equal to '..', `cur` contains the value of `x`. In both cases, `i` remains 2, and `s` is not empty and contains at least one '/' character.***
