According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided to the `input()` function. The loop will execute based on the integer value returned from `input()`. For the loop to execute at least once, the input must be at least 1. Since `cur` is an empty list before the loop starts and is not directly related to the execution of the loop, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time the input must be greater than 0, and i is 0**
