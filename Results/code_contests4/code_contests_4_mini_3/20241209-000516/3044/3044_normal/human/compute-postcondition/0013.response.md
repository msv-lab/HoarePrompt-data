The code `cur = cur[:-1]` slices the list `cur` to exclude its last element. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, performing this operation will not change its state; it will remain an empty list. The values of `i`, `s`, and `x` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `x` is equal to '..'**
