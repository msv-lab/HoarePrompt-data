The code `s = s[1:]` modifies the variable `s` by reassigning it to a new value, which is the result of slicing the original string `s` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. Since `s` is initially given as the second element of the split input string, it is a non-empty string. After executing this line, `s` will contain the string starting from the second character onward. The values of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is the string starting from its second character onward**
