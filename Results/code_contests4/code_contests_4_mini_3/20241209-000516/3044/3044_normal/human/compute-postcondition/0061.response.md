The code `cur.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cur`. The initial state indicates that `cur` is an empty list, and since `x` is not equal to '..', it can be assumed that `x` holds some value that is not a directory reference. Therefore, after execution, `cur` will contain the value of `x`. The variables `i` and `s` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`cur` contains the value of `x`, `i` is 2, `s` is not empty and contains at least one '/' character.**
