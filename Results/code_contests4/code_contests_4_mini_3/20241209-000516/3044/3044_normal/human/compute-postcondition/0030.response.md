The variable `s` is assigned the value of `s.split()[1]`, which means it is set to the second element of the list obtained by splitting the input string `s`. The original state of `cur` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the changes in `s` after execution.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is the second element of the split input string**
