The code `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by removing the last element from it. The previous state of `cur` is not explicitly given, but it is implied that `cur` is a list with at least one element since the loop is expected to execute one more time. The other variables `s.split('/')` and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is the list without its last element, while `s.split('/')` must still have more elements left to iterate over, and `x` is the next element in this split list.

Output State: **`cur` is the list without its last element; `s.split('/')` must have more elements left to iterate over; `x` is the next element in this split list.**
