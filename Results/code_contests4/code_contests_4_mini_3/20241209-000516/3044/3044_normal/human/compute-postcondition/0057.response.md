According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` contains at least one '/' character, which means that the result of `s.split('/')` must yield at least one element. If the first character of `s` is '/', `s` is modified by removing this character. Since `cur` is an empty list and is not directly relevant to the loop execution, we focus on `i` and `s`. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be a non-empty string after processing, and it should contain at least one '/' character. Thus, if `s` has been modified to remove the first character, it should still contain at least one '/' to ensure that `s.split('/')` results in a list with at least one element.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must contain at least one '/' character, and after modification, `s` must not be empty.**
