According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` contains at least one occurrence of the character '/', as it will be split into parts. If the first character of `s` is '/', then the condition is satisfied, and the loop can begin. 

Before the loop starts, `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `s` is starting from its second character onward. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the first character of `s` is '/', which means that `s` must contain at least one '/' character to yield at least one part when split.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to confirm that `s` starts with '/' and that `x` will be the first element obtained from splitting `s` on '/'.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` starts with '/' and `x` is the first part of the split string from `s`.**
