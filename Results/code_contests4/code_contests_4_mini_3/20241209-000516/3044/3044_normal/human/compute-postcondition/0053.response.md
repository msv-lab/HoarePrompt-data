The variable `s` is reassigned to the value obtained by splitting the original input string and taking the second element (index 1) from the resulting list. Since `cur` is an empty list and `i` is 2, these variables remain unaffected. The output state will reflect the updated value of `s`, which will now be the second word from the input string. 

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is the second word from the input string**
