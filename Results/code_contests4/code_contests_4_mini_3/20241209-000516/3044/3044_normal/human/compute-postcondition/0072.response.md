Postcondition: ***`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and if `s` is equal to 'pwd', the output is '/'. Otherwise, `cur` contains the elements of `s` split by '/', excluding any '..' entries, with each '..' causing the last element of `cur` to be removed if it exists, while `i` remains 2 and `s` is not empty and may contain additional '/' characters or segments.***
