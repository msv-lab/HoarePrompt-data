The operation `cur = cur[:-1]` removes the last element from the list `cur`. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, slicing it with `cur[:-1]` will still result in an empty list. Therefore, the value of `cur` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 3**
