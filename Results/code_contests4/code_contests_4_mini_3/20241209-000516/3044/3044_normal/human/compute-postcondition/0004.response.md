The code executes a print statement that concatenates a forward slash ('/') with the result of joining the elements of the list `cur` using a forward slash ('/') as a separator. Since `cur` is an empty list, the join operation will result in an empty string. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be just a single forward slash ('/').

The values of other variables (`i` and `s`) do not affect the outcome of the print statement.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 'pwd'; printed output is '/'**
