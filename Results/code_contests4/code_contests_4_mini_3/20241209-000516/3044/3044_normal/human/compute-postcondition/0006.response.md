The variable `s` is assigned the value of `s.split()[1]`. Since `s` is a string that is not equal to 'pwd', it is assumed to contain at least two words. The `split()` method will divide the string into a list of words, and `[1]` will then select the second word from that list. The values of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `s` is the second word from the original string.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is the second word from the original string**
