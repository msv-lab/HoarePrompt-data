The code prints a string that starts with a slash followed by the elements of the list `cur` joined by slashes. Since `cur` is an empty list, the result of `'/'.join(cur)` will be an empty string. Therefore, the printed output will simply be a single slash (`/`). The values of the other variables `i` and `s` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, and the printed output is '/'**.
