The operation `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by removing the last element from it. Given the initial state where `cur` is an empty list, applying this operation will result in `cur` remaining an empty list because there are no elements to remove. The values of the other variables, `i` and `x`, are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `cur` remains an empty list after the operation. 

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `cur` remains an empty list after the operation.**
