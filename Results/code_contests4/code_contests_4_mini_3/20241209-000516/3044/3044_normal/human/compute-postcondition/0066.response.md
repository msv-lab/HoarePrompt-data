Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list that may remain empty if `x` is equal to '..'; if `x` is '..', the last element of `cur` is removed, resulting in `cur` without its last element. If `x` is not equal to '..', `cur` will append `x` to it, so `cur` contains the previous value of `x` plus the current value of `x` if `x` is not '..'.***
