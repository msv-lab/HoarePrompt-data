The code `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by removing the last element. Since `cur` is an empty list, attempting to remove an element will leave it unchanged. The values of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `x`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` contains at least one '/' character and is not empty, `x` is equal to '..'**
