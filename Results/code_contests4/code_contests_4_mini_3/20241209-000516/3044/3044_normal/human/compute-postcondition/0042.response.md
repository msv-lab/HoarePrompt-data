The `append` method is called on the list `cur`, which is currently an empty list. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be added as an element to the list `cur`. Therefore, after execution, `cur` will contain the value of `x`. The values of `i` and any other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cur` contains the value of `x`, `i` is 2**
