According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input provided and the range of values for `i`. The loop will execute for the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cur` is an empty list. For the loop to execute a second time, the input must be at least 2 (since it starts at 0), which means the input value must be greater than or equal to 2. After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time the input must be at least 2**
