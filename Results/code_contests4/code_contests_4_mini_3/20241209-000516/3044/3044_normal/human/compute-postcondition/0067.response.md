According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list generated by splitting the string `s` by the '/' character. The loop iterates over each element in this list. At the end of the last iteration, the state of `cur` will depend on the value of `x` processed in that iteration. 

If `x` was equal to '..', then the last element of `cur` was removed, which means that `cur` would be missing its last element. If `x` was not equal to '..', `cur` would have the value of `x` appended to it. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will take the next value from the split list of `s`. So if the loop has iterated over all elements in the split list, it cannot execute again. Thus, we need to state that `cur` will still be the same, but the next value of `x` will be the next element from the list created by `s.split('/')`.

State: **`cur` is the current state of the list, for the loop to execute one more time `s.split('/')` must have more elements left to iterate over, and `x` will be the next element in this split list.**
