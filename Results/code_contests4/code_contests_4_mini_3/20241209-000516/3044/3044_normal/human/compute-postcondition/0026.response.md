Postcondition: ***`cur` is an empty list and `i` is 0. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', the printed output is '/'. Otherwise, `cur` contains the valid non-empty substrings from `s` that are not '..', `i` is the number of substrings processed, and `s` is the original substring starting from the second character.***
