The code `cur = cur[:-1]` assigns `cur` the value of itself excluding the last element. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, slicing it with `cur[:-1]` will still result in an empty list. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cur` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` starts with '/', `x` is equal to '..', and `cur` remains an empty list**.
