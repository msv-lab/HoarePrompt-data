The code `s = s[1:]` modifies the variable `s` by taking a substring that starts from the second character of `s`. Since the first character of `s` is a '/', the new value of `s` will be the original string without its first character. The other variables, `cur` and `i`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `s` is the substring obtained by removing the first character from the original `s`.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is the substring of `s` starting from the second character**
