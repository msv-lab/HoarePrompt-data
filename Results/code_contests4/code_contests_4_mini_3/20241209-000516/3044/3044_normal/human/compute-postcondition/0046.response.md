The `cur.append(x)` operation adds the value of `x` to the list `cur`. However, the initial state indicates that `cur` is an empty list, and there is no information provided about the value of `x`. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific effect on `cur` without knowing `x`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list; `i` is 3, and `x` is an unknown value that will be appended to `cur`.**
