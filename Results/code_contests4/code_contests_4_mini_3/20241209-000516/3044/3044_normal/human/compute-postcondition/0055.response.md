The variable `s` is reassigned to `s[1:]`, which means it will take all characters of `s` starting from the second character onward. Since `s` is given as the second word from the input string, the reassignment modifies `s` based on its existing value. The value of `cur` remains as an empty list, and `i` is unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `s` is the second word from the input string without its first character.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is the second word from the input string without its first character.**
