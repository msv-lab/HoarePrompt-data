The function processes a series of commands that simulate navigation in a file system. It accepts a number of commands, where "pwd" outputs the current directory as a path, and "cd <directory>" changes the current directory according to the specified path. The function handles absolute paths by resetting the current path and supports navigation with ".." to move up one directory level. The valid segments are stored in a list, which represents the current directory structure. If the "pwd" command is issued, it prints the current path; otherwise, the current path is updated based on "cd" commands. The function does not return any value. It assumes the input follows the specified format and does not handle invalid commands or parameters.
