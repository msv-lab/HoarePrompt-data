Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to correctly handle the case where the `cd` command is invoked with a relative path that includes `..` without changing the state of the `cur` list properly when it should. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
cd /a/b
cd ../c
pwd
cd ../..
pwd
```

Expected output:
```
/a/c/
/
```

However, the program will output:
```
/a/b/c/
/
```

Explanation:
1. The first `cd /a/b` correctly sets `cur` to `['a', 'b']`.
2. The second `cd ../c` should attempt to go up to `['a']` and then navigate to `c`, resulting in `cur` being `['a', 'c']`.
3. The first `pwd` command should return `/a/c/`, but due to the incorrect handling of the `..` in the second command, it does not reflect the intended directory structure.
4. The second `pwd` command returns `/`, which is correct, but it shows that the program's state was not maintained correctly between commands.

Thus, since there are cases where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is **False**.
