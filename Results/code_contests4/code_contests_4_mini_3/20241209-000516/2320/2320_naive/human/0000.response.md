To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and determine if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Description:
Vanya wants to maximize the number of apple trees he can visit by choosing the best starting square in an n x n field while moving in a specified direction defined by the vector (dx, dy). The path ends when he revisits a square.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the size of the field `n`, the number of apple trees `m`, and the movement vector `(dx, dy)`. Then, it reads the coordinates of the apple trees.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and some coefficients used for calculating the future positions based on the input vector `(dx, dy)`.

3. **Counting Apples**: The program counts how many apple trees can be reached from each starting position by modifying the starting coordinates based on the movement vector and storing results in the `count` list.

4. **Finding the Best Start**: Finally, the program determines the starting position with the maximum number of reachable apple trees.

### Potential Issues:
- The formula `rep_x = ((x + k * dx) % n + n) % n` could lead to incorrect indexing, particularly when `k` is negative or when `x` is at the boundaries of the field.
- The program only considers the x-coordinate for the output `(ans_x, 0)`, which means it assumes that the y-coordinate is always `0`. This does not align with the problem description, which states that both coordinates of the starting square should be provided. This could lead to incorrect answers since it disregards the y-coordinate completely.
- The function `func_1` could also lead to incorrect calculations of `k` if `b` is `0`, although it's intended to handle the GCD calculation.

### Example of Failure:
If we have the following input:
```
5 5 2 3
0 0
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 1
```
The program may output `(1, 0)` instead of `(1, 3)`, which is a valid starting position based on the input. The program fails to account for the y-coordinate of apple trees.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, specifically regarding the output format and potentially incorrect path calculations.

Correctness: **False**.
