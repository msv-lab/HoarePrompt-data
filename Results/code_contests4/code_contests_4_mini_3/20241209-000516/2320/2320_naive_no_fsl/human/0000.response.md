To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and its logic.

The program intends to identify the starting cell for Vanya's walk in a field of size \( n \times n \) such that Vanya can see the maximum number of apple trees based on his movement defined by the vector \( (dx, dy) \).

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The field size is \( n \times n \).
2. Vanya can move in the direction defined by \( (dx, dy) \).
3. The path ends when Vanya revisits a cell.
4. The output should be the coordinates of the cell from which Vanya should start to see the most apple trees.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the size of the field, the number of apple trees, and the movement vector.
2. **Counting Apples**: The program uses a list `count` to store how many trees can be visited from each starting x-coordinate.
3. **GCD Calculation**: It uses a function `func_1` to compute the GCD and some values used for calculating the effective position in the modulo space.
4. **Updating Counts**: For each apple tree's position, it computes where Vanya would visit if he started moving from each possible x-position and updates the tree count accordingly.
5. **Finding the Best Starting Position**: It finds the x-coordinate with the maximum number of trees visited.

### Issues with the Program:
- The program only considers the x-coordinate (`rep_x`) but does not account for the y-coordinate in the final output. The output is always `0` for y, which is incorrect as it should match the starting cell `(x, y)`.
- The calculation of `rep_x` may not properly account for the periodic movement in both dimensions when considering the actual path Vanya would take.
- It does not properly handle cases when `dx` or `dy` is zero, as the movement would not wrap around the field correctly.

### Test Case to Highlight the Issue:
Consider a case where:
```
Input:
3 2 1 1
0 0
1 1
```
Expected Output:
A starting position could be (0, 0) or (1, 1) since both allow Vanya to see apple trees.

Output of the program:
```
0 0
```
While this is correct, if the input were:
```
Input:
3 2 1 1
0 0
1 1
2 2
```
The expected output could be (1, 1) since from (1, 1) Vanya visits (2, 2) and (0, 0) again. However, the program might still output (0, 0) or a different invalid y-coordinate.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all cases. The inability to output the correct y-coordinate based on the maximum tree count leads to an incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**
