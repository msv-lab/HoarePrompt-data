The function accepts an integer `a` representing the size of the field and a list `b` of tuples representing the coordinates of apple trees. If `b` is empty (evaluates to 0), it returns the integer `a`, along with the integers 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the parameters `b` and `a % b`, and returns the values of `g`, `x` (set to `tmp_y`), and `y` (calculated based on `tmp_x`, `tmp_y`, and `a/b`). The function's behavior for non-empty `b` is dependent on the results of the recursive call and may lead to complex calculations based on the input parameters.
