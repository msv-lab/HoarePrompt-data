#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the size of the field (n), with 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6; b is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of apple trees, where each tuple (xi, yi) contains integers such that 0 ≤ xi, yi < a.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return a, 1, 0
        #The program returns the integer 'a' representing the size of the field, along with the integers 1 and 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is an integer representing the size of the field (n), with 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of apple trees, where each tuple (xi, yi) contains integers such that 0 ≤ xi, yi < a. The list `b` is not empty.
    g, tmp_x, tmp_y = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
    return g, x, y
    #The program returns the values of g, x (which is equal to tmp_y), and y (calculated as tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)) based on the output of func_1(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `a` representing the size of the field and a list `b` of tuples representing the coordinates of apple trees. If `b` is empty (evaluates to 0), it returns the integer `a`, along with the integers 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the parameters `b` and `a % b`, and returns the values of `g`, `x` (set to `tmp_y`), and `y` (calculated based on `tmp_x`, `tmp_y`, and `a/b`). The function's behavior for non-empty `b` is dependent on the results of the recursive call and may lead to complex calculations based on the input parameters.
