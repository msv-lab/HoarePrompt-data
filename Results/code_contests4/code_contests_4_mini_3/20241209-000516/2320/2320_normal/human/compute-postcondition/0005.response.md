To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code:

1. The variables `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` are assigned values based on the output of the function `func_1(b, a % b)`. The specifics of this function and its output are not defined, but it provides values for `tmp_x` and `tmp_y`.
2. The variable `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`.
3. The line of code `y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)` computes a new value for `y`. Here, `tmp_x` and `tmp_y` are already defined from the function, and `a` and `b` are constants or variables that contribute to the calculation.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of values based on the computation involving `tmp_x`, `tmp_y`, `a`, and `b`, as well as the assignment of `x` from `tmp_y`.

Output State: **`g`, `tmp_x`, `tmp_y` are assigned based on the output of `func_1(b, a % b)`; `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`; `y` is calculated as `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`**.
