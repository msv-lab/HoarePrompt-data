To determine the output state, we assess the variables involved. 

1. `a` is an integer representing the size of the field, constrained by `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6`.
2. `b` is a non-empty list of tuples representing the coordinates of apple trees, with each tuple satisfying `0 ≤ xi, yi < a`.
3. The code executes a function `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, the second argument, `a % b`, implies a modulo operation; however, since `b` is a list (and not a single integer), this may lead to an error unless `b` is treated as a length or in a specific way.

Assuming `func_1` is defined correctly to handle the inputs, the values `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` are assigned based on the outputs of this function. However, without specific definitions or values from `func_1`, the exact results for `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` cannot be determined.

Thus, the output state will reflect that the variables `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` are assigned based on the function's output. Assuming they receive values based on processing the inputs, we cannot specify them without further information.

Output State: **`g`, `tmp_x`, `tmp_y` are assigned based on the output of `func_1(b, a % b)`**.
