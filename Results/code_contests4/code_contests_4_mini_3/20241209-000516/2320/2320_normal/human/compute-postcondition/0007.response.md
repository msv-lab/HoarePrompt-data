The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. The parameter `a` is an integer representing the size of the field, with a constraint of 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6. The parameter `b` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of apple trees, where each tuple (xi, yi) contains integers such that 0 ≤ xi, yi < a. 

After executing the function body, the function has two potential return cases: 

Case_1: The function returns the integer `a` representing the size of the field, along with the integers 1 and 0.

Case_2: The function returns the values of `g`, `x` (which is equal to `tmp_y`), and `y` (calculated as `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`) based on the output of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `a` (the size of the field) and a list of tuples `b` (the coordinates of apple trees), and based on certain conditions, it returns either a fixed set of values or calculated values based on further function calls.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` (size of the field) and a list of tuples `b` (coordinates of apple trees), returning either the integer `a`, 1, and 0, or calculated values based on further processing from the function.**
