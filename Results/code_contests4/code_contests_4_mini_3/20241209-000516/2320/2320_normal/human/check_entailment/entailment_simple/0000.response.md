Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem describes a scenario where Vanya must determine the best starting cell in an n x n field to maximize the number of apple trees he can visit while moving in the direction specified by the vector (dx, dy). 

However, the annotated program has several issues:

1. **Parameter Misuse**: The function `func_1` takes `a` (the size of the field) and `b` (the list of apple tree coordinates), but the logic within the function does not correspond to any operations or calculations related to finding the optimal starting cell or tracking visits to cells.

2. **Incorrect Return Values**: The program is designed to return values based on some recursive logic involving the greatest common divisor (gcd), but this is irrelevant to the problem. The problem requires a systematic exploration of the cells Vanya would visit based on his movement vector and counting how many apple trees he can encounter, not a gcd calculation.

3. **Lack of Path Exploration**: There is no mechanism in the program to simulate Vanya's movement across the field, check for visited cells, or count the number of apple trees encountered.

4. **Handling of Input**: The function does not properly handle the input format as described in the problem statement. The problem requires reading multiple coordinates for apple trees and using them in calculations to determine the optimal starting point.

Due to these reasons, the program fails to align with the requirements of the problem description. It does not provide a valid solution to the problem of maximizing apple tree encounters based on Vanya's movement in the field. Therefore, it does not implement the necessary logic to determine the best starting cell, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
