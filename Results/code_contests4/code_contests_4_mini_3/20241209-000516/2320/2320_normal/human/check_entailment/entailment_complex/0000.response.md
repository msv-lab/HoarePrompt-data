Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Let's analyze the reasons why:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to take an integer `a` representing the size of the field and a list `b` of tuples representing the coordinates of apple trees. However, the function appears to treat `b` as an integer in the first conditional check (`if (b == 0)`) which is incorrect since `b` is expected to be a list of tuples, not an integer. This indicates a misunderstanding of the input types.

2. **Logic of Movement**: The problem description requires determining the optimal starting position for Vanya to maximize the number of apple trees he can visit while moving in a specified direction. The provided function does not implement any logic related to Vanya's movement or how many apple trees he can find based on his path. Instead, it appears to be doing some form of recursive calculation that does not relate to the coordinates of the apple trees or the movement logic specified in the problem.

3. **Return Values**: The function is returning `g, x, y`, but there is no indication that these values correspond to any meaningful coordinates or the maximum number of trees that Vanya can visit. The return values do not align with the expected output of two space-separated numbers indicating the starting coordinates.

4. **Absence of Path Calculation**: The program does not include any logic to simulate Vanya's movement across the grid based on the direction vector (`dx`, `dy`) or to track visited squares. The problem requires a mechanism to determine when Vanya has returned to a previously visited square, which is missing in this implementation.

Overall, the function does not follow the problem description because it does not handle the inputs correctly, does not implement the required logic for Vanya's movement and path, and does not produce the expected output format. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
