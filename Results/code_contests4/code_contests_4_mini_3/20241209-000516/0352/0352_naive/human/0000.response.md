Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a series of operations to sort a deck of cards by splitting it into contiguous parts and reversing those parts, whereas the program appears to be checking if `n` is a power of 3 (based on the multiplication of `i` by 3). 

For example, if the input is:
```
4
3 1 2 4
```
The expected output should involve a series of operations to sort the list. However, the program simply checks if `4` can be expressed as a power of `3`, which it cannot, and outputs "NO", which does not correspond to the required sorting operations or output format.

Additionally, the program does not handle the input and output format specified in the problem description, leading to further discrepancies in the expected behavior. 

Thus, the program does not work as required, and as it does not meet the problem description for any input case, the correctness is deemed false.
