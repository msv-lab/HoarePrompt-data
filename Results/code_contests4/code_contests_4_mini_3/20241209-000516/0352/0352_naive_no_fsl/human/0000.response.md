Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description as it completely deviates from the task of sorting a deck of cards through specified operations. Instead, the program implements a simplistic check to see if `n` can be represented as a power of 3 by iterating through multiples of 3 and checking if it equals `n`. This logic does not relate to the sorting operations required by the problem.

For example, consider the input:

```
4
3 1 2 4
```

The expected output should detail the operations performed to sort the deck, such as:

```
2
3 1 2 1
2 1 3
```

However, the program does not perform any sorting operations or output the required operations; it simply checks if `n` is a power of 3 and outputs "YES" or "NO". Therefore, it fails to meet the problem's requirements for any given input, leading to an incorrect outcome.
