The value of `i` is multiplied by 3. Since the initial value of `i` is 9, after execution, `i` becomes 27. The variable `sq` is not affected by this operation because there is no condition checking `i` against `n` in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 9 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 27, and `sq` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 9 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 27, `sq` remains unchanged**
