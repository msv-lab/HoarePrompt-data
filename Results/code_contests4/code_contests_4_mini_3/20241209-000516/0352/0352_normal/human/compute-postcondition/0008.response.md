According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to be at least 3. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 3, `sq` remains unchanged**.
