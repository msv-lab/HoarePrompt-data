`sq` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `sq` remains unchanged, but its new value is now `True`. The states of `n` and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 3, `sq` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 3, `sq` is True**
