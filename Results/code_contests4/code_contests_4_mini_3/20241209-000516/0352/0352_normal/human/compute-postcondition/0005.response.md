The variable `sq` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables (`n` and `i`) are not impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the values of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `sq` is True**
