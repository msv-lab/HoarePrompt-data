The value of `i` is updated to `i * 3`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the new value of `i` becomes 3 * 3 = 9. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range 3 to 52, and since `i` is now 9 and does not equal `n` (which could be any value from 3 to 52), `sq` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 9; `sq` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 9; `sq` remains unchanged.**
