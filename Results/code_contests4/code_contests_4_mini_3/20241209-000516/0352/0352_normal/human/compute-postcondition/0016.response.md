The loop multiplies `i` by 3 in each iteration, starting from 1, and checks if `i` equals `n`. 

Since the initial value of `i` is 1 and it is multiplied by 3 in each iteration, `i` will take on the values 3, 9, 27, and 81 as the loop progresses. The loop will continue until `i` exceeds `n`.

Given the constraints on `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52), we can analyze the outcomes:

1. If `n` is 1, `i` will become 3 after the first iteration, and `sq` will remain False.
2. If `n` is 2, `i` will also become 3 after the first iteration, and `sq` will remain False.
3. If `n` is 3, `i` will be 3 after the first iteration, and `sq` will be set to True.
4. If `n` is 4 or 5, `i` will be 3 after the first iteration, and `sq` remains False. After the second iteration, `i` becomes 9, which is greater than 5, and `sq` remains unchanged.
5. If `n` is 6 to 8, `i` will be 3 after the first iteration, and `sq` remains False. After the second iteration, `i` becomes 9, which is greater than 8, and `sq` remains unchanged.
6. If `n` is 9, `i` will be 9 at the second iteration, and `sq` will be set to True.
7. For values of `n` up to 26, `i` will be 27 after three iterations, and `sq` will remain unchanged.
8. If `n` is 27, `i` will be 27 at the third iteration, and `sq` will be set to True.
9. For values of `n` up to 52, after the third iteration, `i` will be 81, which is greater than 52, and the loop will terminate.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the value of `i` will be 81, and `sq` will be True if `n` is 9, 27, or any value greater than those; otherwise, it will remain False.

Output State: **`i` is 81, `sq` is True if `n` is 9 or 27 or more; otherwise, `sq` is False.**
