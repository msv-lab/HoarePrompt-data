The value of `i` is multiplied by 3. Given that `i` is initially 1, after execution, `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 3, and `sq` remains unchanged as it was not set to True since `i` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 3; `sq` remains unchanged**
