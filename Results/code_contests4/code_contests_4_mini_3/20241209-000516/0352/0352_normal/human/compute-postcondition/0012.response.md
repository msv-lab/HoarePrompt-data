According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 52. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 9. Since `n` can be any value from 3 to 52, this condition is satisfied as long as `n` is 9 or greater. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `i` or `sq`, but we need to ensure `n` is at least 9 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 9 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 9, `sq` remains unchanged**
