The variable `i` is assigned the value of 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 1**
