According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52. 

For the loop to execute the first time, the current value of `i` (which is 1) must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` can be at least 1, the loop can execute at least once with the given values. There are no further adjustments needed for `i` or `n` since the conditions are already satisfied.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 1**
