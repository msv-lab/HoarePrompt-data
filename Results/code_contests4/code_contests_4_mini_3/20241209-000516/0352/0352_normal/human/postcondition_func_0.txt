The function reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 52) from input and checks if `n` is equal to 9 or 27 or a power of 3 that is less than or equal to `n`. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The logic for determining if `n` is a power of 3 is achieved by repeatedly multiplying `i` by 3 until `i` exceeds `n`. If `n` is a number that is not equal to 9, 27, or a power of 3, the function will print 'NO'.
