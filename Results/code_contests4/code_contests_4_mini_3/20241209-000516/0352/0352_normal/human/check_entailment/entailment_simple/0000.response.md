Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that sorts a deck of cards by performing a series of operations that involve splitting and reversing parts of the deck. The function is expected to output the number of operations performed and the details of each operation.

However, the annotated program simply checks whether the input integer `n` is equal to 9 or 27 (or greater) based on whether a variable `sq` is set to True. It does not perform any operations related to sorting the deck, nor does it take into account the card values or their arrangement. Furthermore, it does not produce output in the specified format (number of operations followed by the operations themselves).

In summary, the program does not implement any logic to sort the deck of cards as described in the problem statement and instead outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on an irrelevant condition. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
