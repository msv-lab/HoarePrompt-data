Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires a function that sorts a deck of cards using a specific operation of reversing contiguous parts of the deck, while the provided program merely checks if the integer `n` is a power of 3 or equals 9 or 27, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on that condition.

Here are the key reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Functionality Mismatch**: The program does not implement the sorting logic described in the problem description. Instead, it checks for specific numbers (powers of 3) and prints corresponding messages. It does not perform any operations on the deck of cards.

2. **Input Handling**: The program does not read or process the actual deck of cards. The problem requires the program to take a list of integers representing the deck and then apply sorting operations, but the program skips this entirely.

3. **Output Requirements**: The program does not produce the required output format as specified in the problem description. It does not print the number of operations or the details of those operations, which are essential parts of the expected output.

In conclusion, the program does not implement any of the necessary logic to sort the deck of cards or fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Thus, it cannot be considered correct.
