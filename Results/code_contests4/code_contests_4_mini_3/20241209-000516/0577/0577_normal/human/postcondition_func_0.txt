The function accepts an integer `x` (representing a person in a family tree) and a positive integer `dep` (representing a depth level). It traverses the family tree to update the `ans` data structure based on the relationships defined in `query`, modifying `ans` for each ancestor of `x` and adjusting `nowChild` and `dep` accordingly. The function does not return any value explicitly, and its primary purpose is to update the global state of `ans`, reflecting the relationships and queries related to the specified person at the given depth.
