n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of people in the family tree, each of the next n lines contains a name (a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with no more than 20 characters) and an integer (0 ≤ ri ≤ n) representing the direct ancestor of the person, where 0 indicates no ancestor. The subsequent integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, and each of the next m lines contains two integers (1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n) representing the person and the generation depth.
