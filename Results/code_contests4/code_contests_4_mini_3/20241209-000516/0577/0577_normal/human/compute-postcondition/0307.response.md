Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree and `dep` is a positive integer. If `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is set to the value of `fa[x]`, `dep` is decreased by 1, `nowlistindex` remains the maximum index of the `query[x]` list, `i` and `j` retain their assigned values corresponding to the last pair in `query[x]`, and `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is assigned the value of the child at index `nowChild[x]` from the list `Child[x]`, and `dep` is increased by 1.***
