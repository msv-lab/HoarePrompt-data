According to the code, the loop continues executing as long as `x` is not equal to -1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a valid person number in the family tree, indicating that it has not reached -1. Therefore, the loop can execute again without requiring any adjustments to `x`. 

The variable `dep` is a positive integer, and although it can change during the loop, there are no specific conditions provided that would prevent the loop from executing again based solely on `dep`.

State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree and `dep` is a positive integer.**
