The line of code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Since `ans[x][j]` has already been updated with the bitwise OR of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the value being assigned to `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the new value of `ans[x][j]`. The previous contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` are replaced with this value. 

The states of the other affected variables remain unchanged, and since the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` have been cleared prior to this assignment, it will now hold the updated value from `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x]` has at least 1 element, `j` is the first element of `ans[x]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]; ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
