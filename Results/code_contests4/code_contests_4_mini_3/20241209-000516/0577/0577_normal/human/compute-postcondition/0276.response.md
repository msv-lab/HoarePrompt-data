Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is equal to the maximum index of the `query[x]` list, which is even; `i` and `j` are assigned values corresponding to the last pair in `query[x]`; `answer[j]` is either 0 if `dep + i` is not present in `ans[x]` or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` if it is present; the length of `ans[fa[x]]` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is initialized to the first element of `ans[fa[x]]`; and `j` is present in `ans[x]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR of its original value and `ans[x][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is now empty, and `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
