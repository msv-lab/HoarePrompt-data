Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated with the elements from `ans[x]` and `ans[x]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is the length of `query[x]`, `i` is the last element accessed in `query[x]`, and `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`, which has also been cleared.***
