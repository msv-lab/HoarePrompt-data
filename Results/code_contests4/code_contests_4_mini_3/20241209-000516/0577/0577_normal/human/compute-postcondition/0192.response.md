Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, and `j` is a valid index in both `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`. If `ans[fa[x]][j]` is empty, `ans[x][j]` remains updated based on the bitwise OR operation. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is unchanged.***
