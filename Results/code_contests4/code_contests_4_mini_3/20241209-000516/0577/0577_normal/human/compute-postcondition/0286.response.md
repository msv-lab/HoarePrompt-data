Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is equal to the maximum index of the `query[x]` list, which is even; `i` and `j` are assigned values corresponding to the last pair in `query[x]`. If `j` is not present in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if `len(ans[x][j])` is greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. If not, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and then cleared.***
