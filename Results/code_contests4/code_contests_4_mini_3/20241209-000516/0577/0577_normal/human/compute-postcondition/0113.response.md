Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is 0, `i` is assigned the first element of `query[x]`, and `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
