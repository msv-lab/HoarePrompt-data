Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, and `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`. If `len(ans[x])` is less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`, then `ans[x]` is empty after clearing and `ans[fa[x]]` contains updated values based on the elements from `ans[x]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`.***
