Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `ss[x]`; `nowlistindex` is 2; `i` is assigned the third element of `query[x]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][3]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
