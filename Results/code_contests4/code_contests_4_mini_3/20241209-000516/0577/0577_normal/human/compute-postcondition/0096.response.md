Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree, and `dep` is a positive integer. If `x` is not equal to 0, `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[x]` is cleared, and `ans[fa[x]]` is updated with values from `ans[x]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`***.
