The statement `ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]` assigns the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. This means that the value at the specified index `j` in `ans[x]` is being updated to reflect the value from its ancestor's corresponding index `j`. The previous values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are not explicitly stated, but the operation indicates that `ans[x][j]` will now hold the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. 

Other variables (`dep`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `j`) are not affected directly by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `ans[x][j]` is updated to the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
