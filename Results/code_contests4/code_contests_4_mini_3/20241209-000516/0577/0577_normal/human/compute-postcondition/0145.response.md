The command `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[x]` has at least 2 elements and `j` is the second element of `ans[x]`, the list `ans[x][j]` is expected to be a list that can be cleared. Other variables remain unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x]` has at least 2 elements, and `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x]` has at least 2 elements, and `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list.**
