According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `ans[x]`. The loop iterates over each element in `ans[x]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first element of `ans[x]`, and `ans[x]` has at least 1 element. 

After processing the current value of `j`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must move to the next element in `ans[x]`. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be the second element of `ans[x]`, and for the loop to continue executing, `ans[x]` must contain at least 2 elements.

State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x]` has at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element of `ans[x]`.**
