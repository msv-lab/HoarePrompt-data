Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `ss[x]`; `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x])`; `i` is the last element accessed in `query[x]`; `j` is a valid index in `ans[fa[x]]`; and `ans[fa[x]]` contains at least 2 elements. Now, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
