Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x])`, `i` is the last element accessed in `query[x]`, and `j` is a valid index in `ans[fa[x]]` with at least 2 elements. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
