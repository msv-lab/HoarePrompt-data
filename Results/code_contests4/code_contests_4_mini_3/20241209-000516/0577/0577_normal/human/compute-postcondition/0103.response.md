Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree. If `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `dep` is increased by 1, and `x` remains the child at index `nowChild[x]` of `Child[x]`, where `nowChild[x]` is less than `lenChild[x]`.***
