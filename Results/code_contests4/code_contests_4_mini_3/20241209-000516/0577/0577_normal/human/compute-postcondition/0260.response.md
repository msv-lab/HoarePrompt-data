Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`. If `ans[x][j]` is empty, the program reflects that condition. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]`, ensuring the family tree structure is maintained.***
