Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, and `j` is a valid index in `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if `j` is valid in both `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is empty, `ans[x][j]` remains updated based on the bitwise OR operation. If `ans[fa[x]][j]` is not empty, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged.***
