`dep` is incremented by 1. Since `dep` represents the depth level in the family tree and is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), after the execution, `dep` will be increased by 1 while the values of `x`, `nowChild[x]`, and `lenChild[x]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dep` is now increased by 1; `x` is still the child at index `nowChild[x]` of `Child[x]`, where `nowChild[x]` < `lenChild[x]`. 

Output State: **`dep` is now increased by 1; `x` is still the child at index `nowChild[x]` of `Child[x]`, where `nowChild[x]` < `lenChild[x]`.**
