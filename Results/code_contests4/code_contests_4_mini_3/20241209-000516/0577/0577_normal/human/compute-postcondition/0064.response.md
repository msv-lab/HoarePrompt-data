Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, and `j` is an element of `ans[x]` (i.e., `j` is in `ans[x]`). Additionally, the length of `ans[fa[x]]` is greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute for the first time.***
