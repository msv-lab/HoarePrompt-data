The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. This means that the current element `ans[x][j]` is copied to the corresponding position in the family member indexed by `fa[x]`. The values of the other variables (`x`, `dep`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`; `ans[x][j]` is updated; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`; `ans[x][j]` is updated; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]**
