According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to -1. Since `x` is currently an integer representing a person number in the family tree (with the constraint that 1 ≤ x ≤ n), it implies that `x` cannot be -1 under the given constraints. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one time as long as `x` is any valid integer within the specified range.

Thus, there is no need to adjust the state for the loop to execute. 

State: **`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n)**
