The operation `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that all elements in `ans[fa[x]][j]` are removed, but `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged as it was updated based on the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]` earlier. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty, while the previous update to `ans[x][j]` remains intact.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty; `ans[x][j]` remains updated based on the bitwise OR operation.**
