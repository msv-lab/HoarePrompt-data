Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][4]`, and `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][5]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
