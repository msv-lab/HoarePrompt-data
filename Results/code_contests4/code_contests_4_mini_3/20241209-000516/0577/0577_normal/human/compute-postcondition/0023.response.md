Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][4]`, and `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][5]` if `len(query[x])` is greater than 5. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
