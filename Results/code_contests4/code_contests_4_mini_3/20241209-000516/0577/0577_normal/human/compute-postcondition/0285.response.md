Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `nowlistindex` is equal to the maximum index of the `query[x]` list, which is even, `i` and `j` are assigned values corresponding to the last pair in `query[x]`; if `len(ans[x][j])` is greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty after being cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared.***
