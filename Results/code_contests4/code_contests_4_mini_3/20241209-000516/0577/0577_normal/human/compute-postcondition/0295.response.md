Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is equal to the maximum index of the `query[x]` list, which is even. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` have been cleared. If not, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` now equals `ans[fa[x]][j]` after the update. Additionally, `i` and `j` have been updated to point to the next index in `ans[fa[x]]` in both cases.***
