Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), and the number of children accounted for at index `x` is less than the total number of children for index `x` (nowChild[x] < lenChild[x]).***
