The variable `dep` is decremented by 1. The values of `x`, `fa[x]`, and `nowChild[x]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1**
