The operation `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The length of `ans[fa[x]]` is greater than 0, so `ans[fa[x]][j]` exists and is a valid list. The previous values of the affected variable `ans[fa[x]][j]` are now cleared, but the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, `j` is an element of `ans[x]`, the length of `ans[fa[x]]` is greater than 0, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now cleared.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, `j` is an element of `ans[x]`, the length of `ans[fa[x]]` is greater than 0, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now cleared.**
