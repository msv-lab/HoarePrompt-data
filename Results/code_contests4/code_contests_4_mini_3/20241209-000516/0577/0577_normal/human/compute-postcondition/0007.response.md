Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n); `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n); `nowlistindex` is 0; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][0]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`; and the value of `dep + i` is not present in the list `ans[x]`.***
