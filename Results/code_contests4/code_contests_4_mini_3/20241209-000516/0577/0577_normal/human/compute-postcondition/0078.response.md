Output State: **`x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`, and `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` at index `k + 1`.**
