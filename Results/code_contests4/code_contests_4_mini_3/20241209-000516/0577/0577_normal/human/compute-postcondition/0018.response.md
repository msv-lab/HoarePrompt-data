According to the code, the loop iterates based on the `nowlistindex`, which starts at 0 and increments by 2 in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `nowlistindex` is less than the length of `query[x]`. At the end of the last iteration, `nowlistindex` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nowlistindex` needs to be incremented by 2, making it 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `len(query[x])` must be greater than 4.

State: **`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is 4; for the loop to execute a second time, `len(query[x])` must be greater than 4.**
