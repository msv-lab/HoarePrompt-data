The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an element in the array `ans` indexed by `fa[x]` and `j`. The state of `ans[x][j]` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` have been cleared, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x]` has at least 1 element, `j` is the first element of `ans[x]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]; `ans[x][j]` has been updated with the bitwise OR of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]; the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` have been cleared.**
