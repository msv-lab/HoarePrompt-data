Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `j` is incremented by 1, provided that `j` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, no changes are made to `ans[x][j]` if `ans[fa[x]][j]` is empty; otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1 and `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
