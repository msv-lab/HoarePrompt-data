Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n); `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n); `nowlistindex` is 0; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][0]` (the first element of the list corresponding to `x` in `query`, since `len(query[x]) > 0`).**
