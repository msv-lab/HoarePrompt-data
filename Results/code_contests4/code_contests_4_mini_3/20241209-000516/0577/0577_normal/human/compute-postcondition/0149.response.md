Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, and `ans[x]` has at least 2 elements. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` now holds the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
