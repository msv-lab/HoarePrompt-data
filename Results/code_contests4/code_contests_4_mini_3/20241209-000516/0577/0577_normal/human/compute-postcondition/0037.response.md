The code assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Since `ans[x][j]` contains all elements from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the values in `ans[fa[x]][j]` are replaced with the values from `ans[x][j]`. The previous state indicates that `ans[fa[x]][j]` was not empty and now it will be updated to match `ans[x][j]`, while `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now updated to include all elements from `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is now updated to include all elements from `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged.**
