Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x]` has at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element of `ans[x]`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the elements of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` becomes empty. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
