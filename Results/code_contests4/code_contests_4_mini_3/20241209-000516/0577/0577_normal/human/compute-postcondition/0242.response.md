Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared to be an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`, while `ans[x][j]` retains its previous value.***
