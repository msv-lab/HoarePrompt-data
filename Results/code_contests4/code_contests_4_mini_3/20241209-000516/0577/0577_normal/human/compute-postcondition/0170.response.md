Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x])`, `i` is the last element accessed in `query[x]`, `j` is the first element of `ans[fa[x]]` accessed, and `j` is an element of `ans[x]`. Additionally, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least 1 element, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
