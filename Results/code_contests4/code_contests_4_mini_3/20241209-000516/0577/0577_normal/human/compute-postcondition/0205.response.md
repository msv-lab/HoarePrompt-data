Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree and `dep` is a positive integer. If `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, and `dep` is incremented by 1, remaining a positive integer.***
