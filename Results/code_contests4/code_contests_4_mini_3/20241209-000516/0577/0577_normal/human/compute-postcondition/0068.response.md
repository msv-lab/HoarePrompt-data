Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, and `j` is an element of `ans[x]`. Additionally, the length of `ans[fa[x]]` is greater than 0. The length of `ans[x][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
