The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `dep`. The parameter `x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree, constrained to the range 1 ≤ x ≤ n, where n is the total number of persons in the family tree. The parameter `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree, constrained to the range 1 ≤ dep ≤ n. 

Although the output details are not explicitly given, based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function is likely designed to return information related to the specified person `x` at the specified depth `dep` within the family tree structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x`, an integer representing the person number in the family tree, and `dep`, a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree. It is expected to return information related to the person `x` at the depth `dep` within the family tree.**
