The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The variable `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`, and `fa[x]` is the index of the family member in the family tree. The previous state of `ans[fa[x]]` is affected as it now holds the value from `ans[x][j]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`; `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`; `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
