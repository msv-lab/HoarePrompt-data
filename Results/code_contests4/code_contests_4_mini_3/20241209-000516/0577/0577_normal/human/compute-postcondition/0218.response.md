`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. The value of `nowlistindex` is 2, so we calculate `nowlistindex + 1`, which is 3. Therefore, `j` takes the value of `query[x][3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is 2; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][2]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][3]`.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is 2; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][2]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][3]`.**
