The variable `x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. Since `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, and `nowChild[x]` is less than `lenChild[x]`, we can conclude that `nowChild[x]` is a valid index for `Child[x]`. Therefore, after execution, `x` will now hold the value corresponding to the child at the current index `nowChild[x]`.

The states of the other variables (`dep`, `Child`, `nowChild`, and `lenChild`) are not affected by this assignment, but we can describe the output state based on the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n); `x` is now the child at index `nowChild[x]` of `Child[x]`, where nowChild[x] < lenChild[x].**
