Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[x]` has been cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` is now equal to `ans[x]` with `dep` remaining a positive integer and `nowlistindex` equal to the maximum index of the `query[x]` list, which is even, while `i` and `j` are assigned values corresponding to the last pair in `query[x]`.***
