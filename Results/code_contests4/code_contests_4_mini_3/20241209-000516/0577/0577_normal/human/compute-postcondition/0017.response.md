Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n); `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n); `nowlistindex` is 2; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][3]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
