Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include elements from `ans[x][j]` using a logical OR operation, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` remains updated, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
