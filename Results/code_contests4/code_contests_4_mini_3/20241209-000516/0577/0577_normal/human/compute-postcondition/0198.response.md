Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree (not -1) and `dep` is a positive integer. If `x` is not 0, and the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]]` is updated with the elements from `ans[x]` and `ans[x]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is the length of `query[x]`, `i` is the last element accessed in `query[x]`, and `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`, which has also been cleared. If `x` is 0, no changes are made to any variables.***
