The operation `ans[x][j].clear()` is called, which removes all elements from the list `ans[x][j]`. Given that `ans[x]` has at least 3 elements, `j` represents the index of the third element, which means `ans[x][j]` is a valid list. The other variables (`x`, `dep`, and the values in `ans` that were previously affected) remain unchanged, but the list `ans[x][j]` is now empty.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x]` has at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is now empty after being cleared.**
