The operation `ans[x][j].clear()` will remove all elements from the list `ans[x][j]`. The variable `x` refers to a valid person number in the family tree, and `j` represents the next element in the list `ans[x]`. The previous values of the variables indicate that `ans[x][j]` may have contained some values before the clear operation. However, the state of `dep` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is now empty after the clear operation.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is now empty.**
