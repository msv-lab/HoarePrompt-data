Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x]` has at least 3 elements, and `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared, it becomes empty; if not cleared, `ans[x][j]` remains updated, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` holds the value that was previously in `ans[x][j]`.***
