Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, and `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the value of `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
