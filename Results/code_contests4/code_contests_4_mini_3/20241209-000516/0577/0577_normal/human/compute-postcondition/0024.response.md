Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n); `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n); `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`; for each pair `(i, j)` derived from `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0; otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` for each valid pair found.`**
