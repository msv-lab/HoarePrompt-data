Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, `ans[x]` is not empty (length of `ans[x]` â‰¥ 1), `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include elements from `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` has been cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include all elements from `ans[x][j]`, while `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged.***
