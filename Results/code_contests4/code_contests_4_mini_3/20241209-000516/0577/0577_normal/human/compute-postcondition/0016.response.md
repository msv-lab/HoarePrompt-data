The assignment statement affects the variable `answer[j]` by assigning it the length of the list `ans[x][dep + i]`. The values of `i` and `j` are based on the `query` list, where `i` is the value at `query[x][nowlistindex]` and `j` is the value at `query[x][3]`. 

Given that `dep` is a positive integer, `dep + i` will also be within valid bounds for `ans`. The output state reflects the assignments and the resulting length of the list at the specified index.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n); `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n); `nowlistindex` is 2; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][3]`; `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.**
