The value of `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. The values of `i` and `j` are determined from the `query` list using the person number `x`. The variable `dep` is a positive integer, and since `query[x][2]` and `query[x][3]` are valid indices, `i` and `j` will hold specific integer values. The output state will reflect the assignment of `answer[j]` with the calculated length.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is 2; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][2]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][3]`; `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.**
