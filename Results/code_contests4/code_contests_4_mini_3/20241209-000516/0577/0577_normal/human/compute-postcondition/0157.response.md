The statement `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means whatever value was held in `ans[x][j]` will now also be stored in `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is overwritten, but it is not specified what that value was. The other variables `x`, `dep`, and `j` remain unchanged in this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `ans[x][j]` remains updated; `ans[fa[x]][j]` now holds the value that was in `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `ans[x][j]` remains updated; `ans[fa[x]][j]` now holds the value that was in `ans[x][j]`.**
