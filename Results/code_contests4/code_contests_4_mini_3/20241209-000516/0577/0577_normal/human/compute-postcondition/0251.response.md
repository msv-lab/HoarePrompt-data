Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree and `dep` is a positive integer. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the elements from `ans[x][j]` using a logical OR operation, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` remains updated, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
