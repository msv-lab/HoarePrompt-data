The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list or collection at `ans[x][j]`. The previous operation ensured that `ans[fa[x]][j]` included bits from `ans[x][j]`, but this line removes those bits from `ans[x][j]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans[x][j]` is now empty, while `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged from the previous operation.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is unchanged; `ans[x][j]` is now empty.**
