The value of `dep` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `dep` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1.**
