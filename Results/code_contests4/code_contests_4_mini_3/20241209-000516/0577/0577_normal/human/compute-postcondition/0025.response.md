Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n); `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level in the family tree (1 ≤ dep ≤ n); `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`; for each pair `(i, j)` derived from `query[x]`, no changes occur to the variables as the code only contains a comment and does not execute any operations.**
