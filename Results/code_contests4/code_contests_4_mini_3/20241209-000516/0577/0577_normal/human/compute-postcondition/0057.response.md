Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`; `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the value of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` is cleared; if not, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
