The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Since `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`, we can say that the third element of `ans[x]` is being copied to the third element of `ans[fa[x]]`. The previous values of the affected variables are relevant, but since we don't have specific values for `fa[x]`, `ans[x][j]`, or `ans[fa[x]][j]`, we can only infer the assignment operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `ans[x]` has at least 3 elements; `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `ans[x]` has at least 3 elements; `j` is the third element in `ans[x]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.**
