Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x])`, `i` is the last element accessed in `query[x]`, `j` is the last element of `query[x]` accessed, and `answer` is updated based on the condition of `dep + i` in `ans[x]` for all pairs of values from `query[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
