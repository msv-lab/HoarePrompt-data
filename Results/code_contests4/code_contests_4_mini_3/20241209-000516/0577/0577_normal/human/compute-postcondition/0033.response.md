The `ans[x][j]` is cleared, meaning all elements contained in `ans[x][j]` are removed. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `ans[x]` is not empty and has at least one element, as does `ans[fa[x]]`, which suggests that the structure is maintained. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, `ans[x]` is not empty (length of `ans[x]` ≥ 1), `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include elements from `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` has been cleared.
