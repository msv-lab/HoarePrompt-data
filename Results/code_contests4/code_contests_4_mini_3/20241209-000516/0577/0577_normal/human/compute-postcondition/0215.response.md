Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer; `nowlistindex` is 0; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][0]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`. If the sum of `dep` and `i` is not present in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is equal to `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.***
