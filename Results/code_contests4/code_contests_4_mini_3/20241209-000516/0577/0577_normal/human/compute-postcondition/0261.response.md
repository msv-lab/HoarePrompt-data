Postcondition: ***`x` is a valid person number in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer, and `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`. If `j` is not found in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is found in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x][j]` is not empty, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to equal `ans[x][j]`, maintaining the integrity of the family tree structure. If `ans[x][j]` is empty, the program reflects that condition without making any updates to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
