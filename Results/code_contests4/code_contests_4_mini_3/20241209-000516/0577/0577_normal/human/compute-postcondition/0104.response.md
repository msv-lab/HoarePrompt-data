According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `x` is not equal to -1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer representing the person number in the family tree, and its current value is not specified, but we know that for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must remain not equal to -1.

Since the current state does not provide the exact value of `x`, we need to ensure that `x` is not -1 at the end of the last iteration. If `x` is currently -1, then it would need to be adjusted to a valid person number in the family tree.

However, since `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level, it does not directly influence the condition for the loop to continue, but it may need adjustments depending on the logic of the loop body.

Given that we do not have specific values for `x` and `dep`, we will ensure that `x` is greater than or equal to 0 (assuming valid indices) for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is a valid person number in the family tree (not -1), `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth level**
