The line of code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list or array `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This operation affects only the specific list located at the index `fa[x]` and `j`, and does not change the values of `x`, `dep`, `nowlistindex`, or `ans` in any other way. Therefore, while the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` become empty, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty.**
