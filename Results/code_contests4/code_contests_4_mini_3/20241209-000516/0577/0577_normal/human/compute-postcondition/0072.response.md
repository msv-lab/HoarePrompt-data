Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`, and `j` is an element of `ans[x]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is cleared, and it is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
