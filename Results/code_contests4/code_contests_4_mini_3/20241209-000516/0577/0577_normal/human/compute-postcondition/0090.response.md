Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowlistindex` is the largest even index less than the length of `query[x]`; if `ans[fa[x]][j]` is empty, then no changes are made to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1, and `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
