The function accepts a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple consists of two integers representing the start and end times of a lamp. It returns a list `tem` of length `len(arr) + 1`, where each element `tem[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `arr`. However, the code incorrectly attempts to sum tuples directly, which will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the function does not work as intended for the input provided.
