Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; for each lamp `i`, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `sys.stdout` is now set to a `BytesIO` object, and a function is registered to write the output of `sys.stdout` to the standard output using `os.write`.**
