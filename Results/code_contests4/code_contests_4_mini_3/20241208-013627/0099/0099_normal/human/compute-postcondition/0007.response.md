To analyze the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's consider the code provided.

The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arr`, appending to `tem` the sum of the current value of `tem[i]` and `arr[i]`. Starting from an initial list `tem` containing only 0, the first value appended will be `arr[0]`, then `arr[1]`, and so on.

Given that `tem` starts as [0] and each iteration appends a new value that is the sum of the previous cumulative total and the current element from `arr`, after iterating through the entire length of `arr`, `tem` will contain the cumulative sums.

Final output state after all iterations of the loop:
- `tem` will be a list of length `len(arr) + 1`, where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element represents the cumulative sum from `arr`.

Output State: **`tem` is a list of length `len(arr) + 1` where `tem[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `arr` for `i` from 1 to `len(arr)`, and `arr` is a list of tuples representing lamp start and end times.**
