The statement `tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])` appends the value of `tem[i] + arr[i]` to the list `tem`. Given that `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, this indicates `i` is out of the bounds of valid indices for both `tem` and `arr` since valid indices should range from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. Therefore, this operation would lead to an IndexError when trying to access `tem[i]` and `arr[i]`. 

The values of the variables do not change because the operation fails to execute successfully. Therefore, the Output State is: `tem` is [0, arr[0]], `arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, and an IndexError occurs.

Output State: **`tem` is [0, arr[0]], `arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, and an IndexError occurs.**
