Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and returns a line of bytes read from the standard input. It sets up a mechanism to write the output back to standard output upon termination. However, the function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from reading input or writing output, which could result in silent failures if an error occurs during these operations. **
