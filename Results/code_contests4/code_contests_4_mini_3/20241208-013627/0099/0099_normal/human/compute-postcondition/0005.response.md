According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr)`, which is the current length of the `arr` array. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`. Since `arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements for the loop to be valid (as stated), we need to ensure that this condition is met.

At the end of the previous iteration, `tem` is updated to include `tem[i] + arr[i]`, but since `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, the loop will not execute again because `i` will not be less than `len(arr)`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `len(arr) + 1`, and `arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements.

State: **`tem` is [0, arr[0]], for the loop to execute a second time `arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`.**
