The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers: the first integer represents the start time (l_i) of a lamp being turned on, and the second integer represents the end time (r_i) of the lamp being turned off. The function returns a list `tem` of length `len(arr) + 1`, where each element `tem[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `arr`, which represents the lamp start and end times. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of tuples representing lamp timings and return a list that contains the cumulative sums of these timings. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `arr` representing lamp start and end times and returns a list containing the cumulative sums of these timings.**
