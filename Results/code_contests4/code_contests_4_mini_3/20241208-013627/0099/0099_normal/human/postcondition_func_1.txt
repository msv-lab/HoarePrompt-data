The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `r`, where `n` represents the total number of lamps and `r` represents the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously. If `n` is less than `r`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing `facs[n]` by `facs[n - r]`. The function does not handle cases where `facs` might not be defined, which could lead to errors if accessed improperly.
