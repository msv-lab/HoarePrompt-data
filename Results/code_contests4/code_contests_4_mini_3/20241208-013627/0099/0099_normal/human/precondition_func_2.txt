arr is a list of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is an integer representing the start time (l_i) of a lamp being turned on, and the second element is an integer representing the end time (r_i) of the lamp being turned off. The list contains n tuples, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and there is also an integer k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
