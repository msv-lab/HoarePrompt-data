The function accepts two lists of integers, `be` and `en`, representing starting and ending times of lamps. It returns a list `res` that starts with 1, followed by cumulative products of integers from `be[0]` to `en[0]`. However, if `be[0]` is greater than `en[0]`, it returns the list [1] without any cumulative products. The function does not handle cases where `be` or `en` contain more than one element; it only considers the first elements of each list.
