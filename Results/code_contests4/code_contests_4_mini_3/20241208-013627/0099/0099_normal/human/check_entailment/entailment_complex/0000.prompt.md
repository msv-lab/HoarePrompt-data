You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: be is a list of integers representing the starting times (l_i) of n lamps, and en is a list of integers representing the ending times (r_i) of n lamps, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and each time value l_i and r_i satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a list starting with 1 followed by the cumulative products of integers from `be[0]` to `en[0]` if `be[0]` is less than or equal to `en[0]`, otherwise `res` remains [1].
    return res
    #The program returns the list 'res', which starts with 1 followed by the cumulative products of integers from 'be[0]' to 'en[0]' if 'be[0]' is less than or equal to 'en[0]', otherwise 'res' remains [1].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `be` and `en`, representing starting and ending times of lamps. It returns a list `res` that starts with 1, followed by cumulative products of integers from `be[0]` to `en[0]`. However, if `be[0]` is greater than `en[0]`, it returns the list [1] without any cumulative products. The function does not handle cases where `be` or `en` contain more than one element; it only considers the first elements of each list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), k is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and each lamp has a period of time defined by a pair of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n.
def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and each lamp has a period of time defined by a pair of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to `r`.
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the result of the division of facs[n] by facs[n - r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `r`, where `n` represents the total number of lamps and `r` represents the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously. If `n` is less than `r`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing `facs[n]` by `facs[n - r]`. The function does not handle cases where `facs` might not be defined, which could lead to errors if accessed improperly.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is an integer representing the start time (l_i) of a lamp being turned on, and the second element is an integer representing the end time (r_i) of the lamp being turned off. The list contains n tuples, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and there is also an integer k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list of length `len(arr) + 1` where `tem[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `arr` for `i` from 1 to `len(arr)`, and `arr` is a list of tuples representing lamp start and end times.
    return tem
    #The program returns the list 'tem' of length 'len(arr) + 1' where 'tem[i]' is the sum of the first 'i' elements of the list 'arr', which represents lamp start and end times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple consists of two integers representing the start and end times of a lamp. It returns a list `tem` of length `len(arr) + 1`, where each element `tem[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `arr`. However, the code incorrectly attempts to sum tuples directly, which will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the function does not work as intended for the input provided.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each lamp i, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 1,000,000,000.
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a line of bytes read from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a line of bytes read from the standard input. It sets up a mechanism to write the output back to standard output upon termination. However, the function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from reading input or writing output, which could result in silent failures if an error occurs during these operations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
