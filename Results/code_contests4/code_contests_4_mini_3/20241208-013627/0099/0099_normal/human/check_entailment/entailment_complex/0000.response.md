Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the following issues are apparent:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:** 
   - This function computes cumulative products from a single starting time (`be[0]`) to a single ending time (`en[0]`). However, it does not account for all the lamps or their respective time intervals. The problem requires combinations of multiple lamps, and this function does not facilitate that.

2. **Functionality of `func_2`:** 
   - This function checks if `n` is less than `r` (which seems to be a typo as it should be `k`), returning 0 if true. However, it does not compute how many ways to pick `k` lamps that overlap in time, which is essential for solving the problem.

3. **Functionality of `func_3`:** 
   - This function attempts to calculate a cumulative sum of tuples, but it tries to add tuples directly, resulting in a `TypeError`. The cumulative sum is not relevant to the task of counting overlapping lamps.

4. **Functionality of `func_4`:** 
   - This function does not process any input or output relevant to the problem. It merely reads from the standard input and does not perform any calculations or logic required to solve the problem of counting valid lamp combinations.

Overall, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to count the number of ways to select `k` lamps that are all on simultaneously. For example, in the test case where all lamps are off at different times, the program would not handle this correctly, as it does not check for overlapping time intervals. Therefore, there are potential cases where the program would not yield the correct result as per the problem description.
