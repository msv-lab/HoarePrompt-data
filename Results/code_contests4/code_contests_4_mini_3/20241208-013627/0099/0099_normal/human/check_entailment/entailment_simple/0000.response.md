Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Functionality Mismatch**: The problem description requires a computation of the number of ways to select `k` lamps that can all be on at the same time. However, the functions provided do not contain any logic to check for overlapping time intervals among the lamps. Specifically:
   - `func_1` seems to compute cumulative products of a range, which is not relevant to the problem of selecting lamps based on their on/off times.
   - `func_2` checks if `n` is less than `r` (which is not defined in the context of the problem, as it should be `k`) and performs a division of factorials, but it does not relate to the requirement of finding overlapping time intervals.
   - `func_3` calculates a cumulative sum of an array but does not address the core requirement of determining how many sets of `k` lamps can be on simultaneously.
   - `func_4` only handles input/output operations and does not contribute to the logic needed to solve the problem.

2. **Lack of Overlap Checking**: The main challenge of the problem is to determine if there is a moment in time when a chosen subset of `k` lamps is simultaneously on. None of the functions in the annotated program implement logic to check for overlapping intervals among the lamps based on their start (`l_i`) and end (`r_i`) times.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The problem states that the answer should be printed modulo `998244353`, but there is no indication in the functions that such arithmetic is being applied to compute the final answer.

In summary, the program does not implement the necessary logic to determine the number of ways to select `k` lamps that are all on at the same time, nor does it address the specific requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
