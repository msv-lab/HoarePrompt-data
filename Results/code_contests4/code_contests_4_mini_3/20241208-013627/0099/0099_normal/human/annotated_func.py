#State of the program right berfore the function call: be is a list of integers representing the starting times (l_i) of n lamps, and en is a list of integers representing the ending times (r_i) of n lamps, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and each time value l_i and r_i satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a list starting with 1 followed by the cumulative products of integers from `be[0]` to `en[0]` if `be[0]` is less than or equal to `en[0]`, otherwise `res` remains [1].
    return res
    #The program returns the list 'res', which starts with 1 followed by the cumulative products of integers from 'be[0]' to 'en[0]' if 'be[0]' is less than or equal to 'en[0]', otherwise 'res' remains [1].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `be` and `en`, representing starting and ending times of lamps. It returns a list `res` that starts with 1, followed by cumulative products of integers from `be[0]` to `en[0]`. However, if `be[0]` is greater than `en[0]`, it returns the list [1] without any cumulative products. The function does not handle cases where `be` or `en` contain more than one element; it only considers the first elements of each list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), k is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and each lamp has a period of time defined by a pair of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n.
def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and each lamp has a period of time defined by a pair of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to `r`.
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the result of the division of facs[n] by facs[n - r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `r`, where `n` represents the total number of lamps and `r` represents the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously. If `n` is less than `r`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing `facs[n]` by `facs[n - r]`. The function does not handle cases where `facs` might not be defined, which could lead to errors if accessed improperly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is an integer representing the start time (l_i) of a lamp being turned on, and the second element is an integer representing the end time (r_i) of the lamp being turned off. The list contains n tuples, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and there is also an integer k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list of length `len(arr) + 1` where `tem[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `arr` for `i` from 1 to `len(arr)`, and `arr` is a list of tuples representing lamp start and end times.
    return tem
    #The program returns the list 'tem' of length 'len(arr) + 1' where 'tem[i]' is the sum of the first 'i' elements of the list 'arr', which represents lamp start and end times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple consists of two integers representing the start and end times of a lamp. It returns a list `tem` of length `len(arr) + 1`, where each element `tem[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `arr`. However, the code incorrectly attempts to sum tuples directly, which will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the function does not work as intended for the input provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each lamp i, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 1,000,000,000.
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a line of bytes read from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a line of bytes read from the standard input. It sets up a mechanism to write the output back to standard output upon termination. However, the function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from reading input or writing output, which could result in silent failures if an error occurs during these operations.
