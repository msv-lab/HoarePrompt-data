Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to correctly calculate the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima need to walk to buy their cakes. 

### Issue:
The program sorts the tiers and computes the distances for Sasha and Dima sequentially based on their respective positions, but it does not account for the optimal movement strategy effectively. Specifically, it does not consider that they can move to the same house at the same time or that they might need to optimize their paths based on the sequence of available tiers. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
2
1 1 2 2
```
The expected output is `5`, which can be achieved by:
- Sasha goes to house 1 (distance = 0, buys tier 1)
- Dima goes to house 2 (distance = 1, buys tier 1)
- Sasha goes to house 3 (distance = 1, buys tier 2)
- Dima goes to house 4 (distance = 1, buys tier 2)

Total distance = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. However, the program's logic might not capture this optimal strategy, leading to incorrect distance calculations.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and returns the wrong distances based on its logic.
