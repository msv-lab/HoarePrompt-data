To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and see if it correctly computes the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima walk to buy their cake tiers in the specified order.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - An integer `n`, representing the number of tiers.
   - A list of `2n` integers, where each integer represents the size of a cake tier available at a specific house. Each size from `1` to `n` is available exactly twice.

2. **Output**:
   - The minimum distance that Sasha and Dima have to walk to buy the tiers in order from `1` to `n`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - They start at the first house (index 1 in a 1-based system).

### Program Logic:
1. The program reads the input and constructs a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple consists of the tier size and the corresponding house index.
2. The program then calculates the total distance for both Sasha and Dima to purchase their respective tiers:
   - The first loop calculates the distance Sasha covers for the first occurrences of sizes `1` through `n`.
   - The second loop calculates the distance Dima covers for the second occurrences of sizes `1` through `n`.

### Key Observations:
- The program seems to correctly separate the positions of the first and second occurrences of each tier size and calculates the distances accordingly.
- However, it does not account for the fact that both Sasha and Dima may need to traverse the same house for the second tier of the same size in an optimal manner.

### Testing for Edge Cases:
Consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  1 2 2 1
  ```
  
- Expected Output:
  ```
  5
  ```
  
- Walkthrough of the expected optimal path:
  - Sasha goes to house 1 (distance 0) -> buys tier 1.
  - Dima goes to house 4 (distance 3) -> buys tier 1.
  - Sasha goes to house 2 (distance 1) -> buys tier 2.
  - Dima goes to house 3 (distance 1) -> buys tier 2.
  
- Total distance = 0 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

**Actual Calculation by the Program**:
- The program sorts the input to:
  ```
  [(1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3)]
  ```
- The calculated distance:
  - For Sasha: House 1 to House 1 (0), House 1 to House 2 (1) -> Total from Sasha = 1.
  - For Dima: House 4 to House 2 (2) from previous position (1) -> Total from Dima = 2.
  
- The calculated total distance = 1 + 2 = 3, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for the minimum distance Sasha and Dima need to walk when both need to acquire the same tier sizes, leading to an incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to ensure that both Sasha and Dima can optimally share the same house without unnecessary traveling, which can lead to suboptimal total distances in certain arrangements of cake tiers.
