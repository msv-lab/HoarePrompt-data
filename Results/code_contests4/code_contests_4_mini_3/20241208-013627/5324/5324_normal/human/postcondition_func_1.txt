The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` that contains `2 * n` integers, where each integer from 1 to `n` occurs exactly twice. It calculates the total distance traveled through the positions of these integers in the sorted list, by summing the absolute differences between consecutive positions of each integer's occurrences, and prints the total distance. The function does not handle cases where the input constraints are not met, such as if `n` is outside the range 1 to 100,000 or if the list does not contain the required integers.
