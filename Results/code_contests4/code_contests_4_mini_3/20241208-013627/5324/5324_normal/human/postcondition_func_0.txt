The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns `x`, which is the GCD of any number and 0. The function correctly handles cases where `y` may initially be 0, returning `x` immediately in that case.
