The variable `prev` is initialized to the value 1. The variables `n`, `a`, and `dist` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is initialized to 0, and `prev` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is initialized to 0, `prev` is 1**
