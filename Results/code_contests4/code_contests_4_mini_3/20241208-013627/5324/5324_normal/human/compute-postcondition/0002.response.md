The variable `dist` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples, and `dist` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is initialized to 0**
