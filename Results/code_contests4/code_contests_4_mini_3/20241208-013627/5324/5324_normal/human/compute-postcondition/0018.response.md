According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `prev` is 1, which does not influence the execution of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will take on values starting from 0 up to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`prev` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
