To analyze the given code snippet, let's break down the impact step by step:

1. The variable `prev` was initially assigned the value of `a[1][1]`.
2. The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `a[3][1]`.
3. The code `prev = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is `a[3][1]`) to `prev`.

Now, after executing the code, `prev` will now hold the value of `pos`, which is `a[3][1]`.

The initial values of `prev`, `i`, and `pos` are not changed aside from `prev`, which is now equal to `a[3][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `prev` and the unchanged values of `i` and `pos`.

Output State: **`prev` is `a[3][1]`, `i` is 1, `pos` is `a[3][1]`**
