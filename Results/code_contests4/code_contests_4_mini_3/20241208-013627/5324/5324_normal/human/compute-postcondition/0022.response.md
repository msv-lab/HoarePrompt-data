According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 1.

State: **`prev` is `a[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `pos` is `a[1][1]`, `dist` is increased by abs(a[1][1] - 1), for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
