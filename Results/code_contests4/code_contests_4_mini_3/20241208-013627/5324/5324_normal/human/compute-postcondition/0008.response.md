According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, but we need to focus on the loop control variable `i`. Since `i` is typically initialized to 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, we need to determine the state for the next iteration. 

If `i` is currently at its maximum value of `n - 1` when the loop ends, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`. Therefore, `i` will be `n` in the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n`.

State: **`prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i`, and `i` will be `n`.**
