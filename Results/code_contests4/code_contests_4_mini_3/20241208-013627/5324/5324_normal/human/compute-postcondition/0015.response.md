The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. The previous value of `pos` was assigned from `a[2 * i][1]`, and now `prev` will hold that same value. The other variables `dist` and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `dist` would have been updated previously. The loop condition `n` must be greater than `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is now equal to `pos`, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2 * i][1]`, and `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute a second time.**
