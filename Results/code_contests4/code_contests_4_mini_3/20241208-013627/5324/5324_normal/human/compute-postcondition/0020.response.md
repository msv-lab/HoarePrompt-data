To analyze the code snippet:

1. The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `a[1][1]`, but we do not have the specific value for `a[1][1]` defined in the initial state.
2. The expression `abs(pos - prev)` calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. Since `prev` is 1, the calculation becomes `abs(a[1][1] - 1)`.
3. The variable `dist` is then incremented by the result of this absolute difference. The value of `dist` prior to this operation is not provided, so we will refer to it as `dist + abs(a[1][1] - 1)`.

Given that `dist` is affected but not defined initially, we can't provide a specific value for `dist`. However, we can state the transition clearly.

Output State: **`prev` is 1, `i` is 0, `pos` is a[1][1], and `dist` is increased by abs(a[1][1] - 1)**.
