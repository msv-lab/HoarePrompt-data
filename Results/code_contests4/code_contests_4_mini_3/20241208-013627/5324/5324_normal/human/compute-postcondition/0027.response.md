To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state.

Initial State: `prev` is `a[3][1]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.

In this context, the code `pos = a[2 * i + 1][1]` will be processed as follows:

1. The value of `i` is 2. 
2. The expression `2 * i + 1` calculates to `2 * 2 + 1`, which equals `4 + 1 = 5`.
3. Therefore, `pos` is assigned the value `a[5][1]`.

The other variables, `prev` and `n`, are not affected by this assignment. The output state reflects the new value assigned to `pos`.

Output State: **`prev` is `a[3][1]`, `i` is 2, `pos` is `a[5][1]`**.
