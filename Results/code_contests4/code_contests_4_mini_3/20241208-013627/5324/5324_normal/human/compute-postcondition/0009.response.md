The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2 * i][1]`, where `i` is equal to `n`. The value of `a[2 * n][1]` is determined based on the contents of the array `a`. The previous value of `prev` does not change as it is unaffected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2 * n][1]`.
Output State: **`prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2 * n][1]**
