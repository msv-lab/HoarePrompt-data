Given the initial state where `prev` is 1, `i` is 0, `pos` is `a[1][1]`, and `dist` is increased by `abs(a[1][1] - 1)`:

1. The code `prev = pos` assigns the value of `pos` to `prev`.
2. The value of `pos` is `a[1][1]`, which means `prev` will now hold the value of `a[1][1]`.
3. The variable `i` remains unchanged (still 0).
4. The variable `dist` remains unchanged as there are no operations altering it in this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes to `prev` and the unaltered values of `i`, `pos`, and `dist`.

Output State: **`prev` is `a[1][1]`, `i` is 0, `pos` is `a[1][1]`, `dist` is increased by abs(a[1][1] - 1)**
