`prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, which means `prev` will now hold the value that `pos` had before this assignment. The values of `pos` and `dist` remain unchanged after this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `pos`, `pos` remains unchanged, and `dist` is unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is now equal to the previous value of `pos`, `pos` remains unchanged, and `dist` is unchanged.**
