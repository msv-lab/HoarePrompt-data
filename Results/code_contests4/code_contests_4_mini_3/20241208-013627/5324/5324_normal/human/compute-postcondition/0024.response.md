The variable `dist` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. The values of `pos` and `prev` are determined by the initial state where `prev` is `a[1][1]` and `pos` is `a[2 * 1 + 1][1]`, which simplifies to `a[3][1]`. The impact on the program is that `dist` is increased by `abs(a[3][1] - a[1][1])`.

Since the other variables (`i` and `n`) are not directly affected by this specific line of code execution, we will only update `dist` while keeping the other variables' states unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is `a[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `pos` is `a[3][1]`, `dist` is increased by `abs(a[3][1] - a[1][1])`.

Output State: **`prev` is `a[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `pos` is `a[3][1]`, `dist` is increased by `abs(a[3][1] - a[1][1])**
