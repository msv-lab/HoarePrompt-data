According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `pos`, `pos` remains unchanged, and `dist` is unchanged. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently less than `n`, we will set `i` to `i + 1`. The loop will execute another time if the updated value of `i` is still less than `n`.

State: **`prev` is now equal to the previous value of `pos`, `pos` remains unchanged, `dist` is unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i` (which will be increased by 1)**
