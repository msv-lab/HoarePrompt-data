The code `dist += abs(pos - prev)` updates the value of `dist` by adding the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev` to it. The previous values show that `prev` holds the value of the previous `pos`, while `pos` is derived from the array `a` at the specified indices. The variable `dist` remains unchanged prior to this operation, and `n` and `i` control the loop's execution.

After executing the code, the output reflects the updated state of `dist`. The specific values of `pos` and `prev` are not provided, but their relationship affects the calculation of `abs(pos - prev)`.

Output State: **`prev` is now equal to the previous value of `pos`; `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2 * i][1]`; `dist` is updated by adding abs(pos - prev); `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute a second time.**
