According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variables `a`, `dist`, and `prev` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they might be relevant to the loop body. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, before the first iteration of the loop, the variable `i` will start at 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `dist` is 0, `prev` is 1, `i` is 0**
