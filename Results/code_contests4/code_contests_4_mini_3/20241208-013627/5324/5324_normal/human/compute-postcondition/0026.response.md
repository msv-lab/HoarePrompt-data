According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`prev` is `a[3][1]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
