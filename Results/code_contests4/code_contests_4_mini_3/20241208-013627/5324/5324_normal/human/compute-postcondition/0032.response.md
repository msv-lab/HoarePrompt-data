The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \). The parameter `a` is a list containing \( 2 \cdot n \) integers, where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \) and each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice. 

After executing the function body, it processes the list `a` and returns a value based on the occurrences of integers from 1 to n. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and it performs operations based on this input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` that contains \( 2 \cdot n \) integers, where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice, and processes this input to return a specific output based on the occurrences.**
