To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the annotations provided.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The problem requires two individuals, Sasha and Dima, to buy two n-tier cakes from a series of houses arranged in a row. Each house sells a specific size tier, and both individuals must purchase tiers in ascending order from 1 to n. The objective is to minimize the total distance walked by both individuals while buying these tiers.

### Code Breakdown:
The two functions provided are `func_1` and `func_2`, but only `func_2` is relevant for the problem, as `func_1` computes the GCD, which is unrelated to the task of calculating walking distances.

#### `func_2`:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads `n` and a list `a` containing `2 * n` integers.
   - Sorts the list `a` based on the tier sizes and retains their original positions.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total distance walked by iterating through the sorted positions twice, once for each individual's purchases (for the two occurrences of each tier size).

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the total distance after both individuals have purchased their respective tiers.

### Edge Cases and Annotations:
1. The annotation indicates the function does not handle input constraints outside the specified range (i.e., `n` must be between 1 and 100,000). However, the problem guarantees that the input will conform to this specification.

2. The annotation also states that the function calculates the total distance traveled through the positions of these integers in the sorted list. It does not mention any constraints or errors that might arise when `n` is not met, but since the problem guarantees valid input, we can assume it won't be an issue in practice.

3. The algorithm calculates the distances for both individuals as they purchase the tiers in sequence. However, it operates under the assumption that they can freely alternate their purchases, which might not always result in the minimum distance. For example, if both individuals have the same tier to buy in adjacent houses, they will still have to traverse the distance back and forth, potentially resulting in longer distances than necessary.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the case:
```
n = 1
a = [1, 1]
```
The expected output should be `1` since both can buy from the same house without moving. However, the program will calculate this distance as `2`, assuming they both travel to the only available tier.

### Conclusion:
The code does not guarantee the minimum distance in all cases due to its greedy approach of processing each tier without considering the optimal paths they can take. It could potentially lead to suboptimal walking distances in certain configurations of the input. Thus, the program does not conform to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program would fail in cases where both individuals have to buy the same size tier from adjacent houses, leading to unnecessary additional distance traveled.
