To determine the correctness of the provided annotated program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Sasha and Dima must buy two n-tier cakes, where each tier size ranges from 1 to n and they must be purchased in ascending order.
- Each tier size is available in two different houses.
- The goal is to calculate the minimum distance they have to walk to buy both cakes, starting from the leftmost house.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. However, it is not used in the context of the problem and does not contribute to the solution.

2. **Function 2**:
   - This function reads the input and processes the list of available cake tiers.
   - It sorts the tiers based on their sizes and keeps track of their respective positions.
   - The first loop calculates the distance for Sasha to buy his tiers (located at even indices of the sorted list).
   - The second loop calculates the distance for Dima to buy his tiers (located at odd indices of the sorted list).
   - Finally, it prints the total distance walked by both Sasha and Dima.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly identifies the positions of the tiers from the sorted list and calculates the distances Sasha and Dima must walk to buy their tiers in the correct order.
- The logic of walking from one position to the next and accumulating the distance is in line with the requirement to minimize walking distance while buying in ascending order.
- The program does not account for the possibility of both individuals being able to start at the same house at the same time, but it correctly computes distances as if they are moving sequentially, which is sufficient given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum walking distance needed for both Sasha and Dima to purchase the cake tiers in the required order.

Therefore, the final correctness evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**
