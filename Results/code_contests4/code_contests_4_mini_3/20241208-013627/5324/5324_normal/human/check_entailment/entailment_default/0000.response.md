To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to review the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description
Sasha and Dima need to buy cake tiers from houses in a specific order. The task is to determine the minimum distance they have to walk to acquire all tiers, where they can only buy tiers in ascending order from 1 to n.

### Functions and Output Hints
**Function 1:**
```python
def func_1(x, y):
    """greatest common divisor of x and y"""
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
```
**Output Description for Function 1:** 
The function computes the GCD of two integers. This function does not relate to the problem of calculating the walking distance, as the problem does not require GCD calculations.

**Function 2:**
```python
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    a = sorted(zip(map(int, input().split()), range(1, 2 * n + 1)))
    dist = 0
    prev = 1
    for i in range(n):
        pos = a[2 * i][1]
        dist += abs(pos - prev)
        prev = pos
    prev = 1
    for i in range(n):
        pos = a[2 * i + 1][1]
        dist += abs(pos - prev)
        prev = pos
    print(dist)
```
**Output Description for Function 2:**
This function correctly takes in the number of tiers and their respective positions, sorts them, and calculates the total distance traveled in the prescribed manner. 

### Initial Assessment
- **Function 1** is irrelevant to the problem.
- **Function 2** seems to follow the problem description by:
  - Reading the size of the cakes.
  - Reading the positions of each tier.
  - Sorting the positions based on the tiers.
  - Calculating the total walking distance based on the positions.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Input Case**: If `n = 1`, the only valid input is `[1, 1]`. The output should be `1` (the distance from house 1 to house 2).
2. **Maximum Input Case**: If `n = 100000`, the positions are varied but should always yield a valid output as long as the constraints are adhered to.
3. **Order of Tiers**: The function assumes that the ordering of tiers will always have both positions available. If both tiers of the same size are at the same position, this could lead to incorrect distance calculations.

### Checking Output Hints
The output hints for function 2 correctly describe the operations performed by the function:
- The calculation of distances based on the sorted positions.
- However, they do not mention potential issues with simultaneous purchases or tied positions.

### Conclusion
While **Function 2** generally handles the core logic required by the problem, it neglects to account for edge cases such as:
- The possibility of both tiers of the same size being located in the same house, which could lead to an incorrect total distance being calculated.

Based on this reasoning, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where the same tier size is available at the same position, which could result in an incorrect calculation of the total distance walked.
