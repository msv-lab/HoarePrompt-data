You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sasha and Dima want to buy two n-tier cakes. Each cake should consist of n different tiers: from the size of 1 to the size of n. Tiers should go in order from the smallest to the biggest (from top to bottom).

They live on the same street, there are 2 ⋅ n houses in a row from left to right. Each house has a pastry shop where you can buy a cake tier. Unfortunately, in each pastry shop you can buy only one tier of only one specific size: in the i-th house you can buy a tier of the size a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).

Since the guys carry already purchased tiers, and it is impossible to insert a new tier in the middle of the cake, they agreed to buy tiers from the smallest to the biggest. That is, each of them buys tiers in order: 1, then 2, then 3 and so on up to n.

Initially, Sasha and Dima are located near the first (leftmost) house. Output the minimum distance that they will have to walk in total to buy both cakes. The distance between any two neighboring houses is exactly 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer number n — the number of tiers in each cake (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains 2 ⋅ n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where a_i is equal to the size of the tier, which can be bought in the i-th house. Remember that in each house you can buy only one tier. It is guaranteed that every number from 1 to n occurs in a exactly two times.

Output

Print one number — the minimum distance that the guys have to walk in total to buy both cakes. Guys can be near same house at the same time. They begin near the first (leftmost) house. Each of the guys should buy n tiers in ascending order of their sizes.

Note

In the first example, the possible optimal sequence of actions is:

  * Sasha buys a tier of size 1 near the 1-st house (a_1=1); 
  * Dima goes to the house 2; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 1 near the 2-nd house (a_2=1); 
  * Sasha goes to the house 4; 
  * Sasha buys a tier of size 2 near the 4-th house (a_4=2); 
  * Sasha goes to the house 5; 
  * Sasha buys a tier of size 3 near the 5-th house (a_5=3); 
  * Dima goes to the house 3; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 2 near the 3-rd house (a_3=2); 
  * Dima goes to the house 6; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 3 near the 6-th house (a_6=3). 



So, Sasha goes the distance 3+1=4, and Dima goes the distance 1+1+3=5. In total, they cover a distance of 4+5=9. You can make sure that with any other sequence of actions they will walk no less distance.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of 2 * n integers where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) occurs exactly twice.
def func_1(x, y):
    """greatest common divisor of x and y"""
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of 2 * `n` integers where each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`) occurs exactly twice; `x` is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, where y is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns the initial value of x.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of 2 ⋅ n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    a = sorted(zip(map(int, input().split()), range(1, 2 * n + 1)))
    dist = 0
    prev = 1
    for i in range(n):
        pos = a[2 * i][1]
        
        dist += abs(pos - prev)
        
        prev = pos
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prev` is equal to the value of `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]` if `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is the sum of absolute differences calculated during the loop, and if `n` is 0, `dist` is 0 and `prev` is 1.
    prev = 1
    for i in range(n):
        pos = a[2 * i + 1][1]
        
        dist += abs(pos - prev)
        
        prev = pos
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prev` is `a[2n-1][1]`, `dist` is the total of distances calculated during the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer.
    print(dist)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
