The function accepts a variable-length tuple `args` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) indicating the number of subsequent integers. It writes each of these integers to the standard output as strings, but does not handle any cases where `args` may not conform to these expectations, such as when `n` is not followed by the correct number of integers or if `args` is empty.
