#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input, which is not specified but must be within the range of a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as an integer. The value must be within the range of a positive integer, specifically between 1 and 100,000, but the function does not handle any input validation or edge cases related to the input format or value range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing n integers read from standard input, each of which is converted to an integer from the input values split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing those integers converted from the input values split by spaces. The function expects that the input will consist of valid integers within the specified range, but it does not handle any potential input errors or edge cases such as non-integer values or empty input.

def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a single line input from standard input, which is a string with trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string representing a single line input from standard input, with any trailing whitespace removed. There are no edge cases handled, as the function directly reads from input without validation or error handling.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers; `s` is the last element in `args`, and all elements in `args` have been written to standard output separated by spaces.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args`, where the first element is an integer `n` representing the number of subsequent integers. It iterates through the elements in `args`, writing each one to standard output separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. It is assumed that `n` is at least 1 and that there are `n` integers following it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array.
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length tuple containing an integer n followed by n integers; `s` is the last integer in `args`; all integers in `args` have been written to standard output as strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length tuple `args` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) indicating the number of subsequent integers. It writes each of these integers to the standard output as strings, but does not handle any cases where `args` may not conform to these expectations, such as when `n` is not followed by the correct number of integers or if `args` is empty.
