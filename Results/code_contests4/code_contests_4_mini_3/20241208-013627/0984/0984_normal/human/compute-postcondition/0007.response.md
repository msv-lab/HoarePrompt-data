The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `args`, which is a variable-length tuple. The first element of this tuple is an integer `n` that represents the number of subsequent integers in the tuple, with the constraint that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`. The following `n` elements are integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, each of which satisfies the constraint `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. 

The function performs operations based on the values in the tuple and returns a result based on these inputs. However, the specific output behavior was not provided in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts a variable-length tuple `args` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**
