The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args`, where the first element is an integer `n` representing the number of subsequent integers. It iterates through the elements in `args`, writing each one to standard output separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. It is assumed that `n` is at least 1 and that there are `n` integers following it.
