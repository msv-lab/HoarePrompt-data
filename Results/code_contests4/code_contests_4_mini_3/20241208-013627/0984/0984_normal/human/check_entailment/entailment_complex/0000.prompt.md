You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input, which is not specified but must be within the range of a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as an integer. The value must be within the range of a positive integer, specifically between 1 and 100,000, but the function does not handle any input validation or edge cases related to the input format or value range.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing n integers read from standard input, each of which is converted to an integer from the input values split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing those integers converted from the input values split by spaces. The function expects that the input will consist of valid integers within the specified range, but it does not handle any potential input errors or edge cases such as non-integer values or empty input.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a single line input from standard input, which is a string with trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string representing a single line input from standard input, with any trailing whitespace removed. There are no edge cases handled, as the function directly reads from input without validation or error handling.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers; `s` is the last element in `args`, and all elements in `args` have been written to standard output separated by spaces.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args`, where the first element is an integer `n` representing the number of subsequent integers. It iterates through the elements in `args`, writing each one to standard output separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. It is assumed that `n` is at least 1 and that there are `n` integers following it.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array.
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length tuple containing an integer n followed by n integers; `s` is the last integer in `args`; all integers in `args` have been written to standard output as strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length tuple `args` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) indicating the number of subsequent integers. It writes each of these integers to the standard output as strings, but does not handle any cases where `args` may not conform to these expectations, such as when `n` is not followed by the correct number of integers or if `args` is empty.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
