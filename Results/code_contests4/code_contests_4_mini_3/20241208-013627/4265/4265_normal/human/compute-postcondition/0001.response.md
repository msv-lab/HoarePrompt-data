The expression `print(n * m) / 2` first calculates the product of `n` and `m`, then attempts to divide the result by 2. However, the `print` function does not return a value; it outputs to the console instead. Therefore, only the multiplication occurs, and the division is not performed since it is not assigned to any variable or printed. 

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged after this operation. The output of the code is simply the printed result of `n * m`.

However, since `print` does not return a value, we note that the multiplication has been performed.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are unchanged; `n * m` has been printed.**
