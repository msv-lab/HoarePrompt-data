The provided program is intended to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on a rectangular drill field of size `n × m` such that no two soldiers conflict according to the curse defined in the problem description. The curse states that the squared distance between any two soldiers must not equal 5.

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    print(n * m) / 2
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input, which represent the dimensions of the field. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program calculates `n * m`, which gives the total number of cells in the `n × m` grid.
   - However, it then divides this product by 2 and prints the result. The intent seems to be to account for the curse, but the program does not correctly implement the logic to avoid the specific placements that would trigger conflicts.

3. **Conflict Condition**: The curse specifically states that two soldiers will conflict if they are placed such that the squared distance between them equals 5. The cells that lead to such conflicts are specific pairs of coordinates. The program does not check for these pairs or implement any valid placement strategy; it merely halves the total number of available cells without any justification.

4. **Examples Validation**:
   - For a `2 x 4` grid, the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed without conflicts is indeed 4, but the program does not correctly derive this from the input.
   - For a `3 x 4` grid, the program outputs `(3 * 4) / 2 = 6`, which is correct in this specific case, but it does not represent a general solution to the problem.

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to ensure that the placements of soldiers adhere to the constraints imposed by the curse. It oversimplifies the problem by simply halving the total number of cells without considering the specific conditions outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
