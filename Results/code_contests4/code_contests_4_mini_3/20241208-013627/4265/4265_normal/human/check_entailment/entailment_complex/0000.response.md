Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. According to the problem, we need to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on a rectangular field of size n × m such that no two soldiers are in positions where the squared distance between them equals 5.

The provided program attempts to calculate the number of soldiers by computing `n * m / 2`, which is not the correct approach. This formula does not take into account the specific positions on the grid that would lead to conflicts as described in the problem. The correct placement of soldiers on the grid must consider the specific coordinates and how they relate to each other.

For example, in a 2 × 4 field, the configuration that allows for 4 soldiers is not simply half of the total number of positions, but rather a specific arrangement that avoids the cursed positions. The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of soldiers can be found by halving the total positions without considering the curse's constraints.

In summary, the program does not adhere to the logic or requirements set forth in the problem description regarding the curse, leading to an incorrect outcome.
