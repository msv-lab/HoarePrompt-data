Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be positioned on the field without conflicting with each other. The expression `(n * m) / 2` does not account for the specific positions on the grid that are prevented due to the curse.

For example, consider the input `1 2`. The field is 1 row and 2 columns, which means it can accommodate 2 soldiers without any conflicts. However, the program would output `1.0` (since `(1 * 2) / 2 = 1`), which is incorrect as it implies only 1 soldier can be placed, whereas in reality, 2 soldiers can be placed.

Another counterexample is for the input `2 2`. The program would output `2.0` (since `(2 * 2) / 2 = 2`), but in fact, 2 soldiers can be placed (for instance, at positions (1, 1) and (2, 2)) without conflicts, which is correct. However, this logic fails in larger grid sizes or odd dimensions where the distribution of soldiers needs to be more carefully considered to avoid conflicts based on the curse.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
