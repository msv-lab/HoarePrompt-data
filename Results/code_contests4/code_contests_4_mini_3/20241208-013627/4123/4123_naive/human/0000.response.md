To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic against the requirement to find the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square.

The program reads the size of the square and the coordinates of two points on its sides. The function `func_1` computes a distance based on the coordinates of the points.

**Potential Issues with the Program:**

1. **Understanding the Distance Calculation:**
   - The calculation of distance in the function `func_1(x, y)` is not straightforward. It seems to be trying to translate the coordinates of points on the square into a linear representation, but without clear documentation or comments, it's challenging to verify its accuracy.
   - The conditions seem to handle different sides of the square but do not properly reflect the geometric distances that would actually occur between points.

2. **Testing Edge Cases:**
   - Consider two points that are adjacent to each other on the square's perimeter, such as `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)`. The expected output should be `1`, which seems to be calculated correctly.
   - However, let's test with two points that are not adjacent but on the same side, such as `(0, 1)` and `(2, 1)`. The expected output should be `2`, but the program may calculate a larger distance due to the way it sums up the distances based on side adjustments.
   - For points on opposite sides, such as `(0, 0)` and `(n, n)`, the expected output should be `2n`, but the program's logic may miscalculate due to the transformation logic.

3. **Modulus Operation:**
   - The use of the modulus operation `% (4 * n)` might lead to incorrect results, especially for distances that exceed `4n`. This would incorrectly wrap around distances that are longer than the perimeter of the square.

Given these observations, I can identify specific cases where the program may yield incorrect results. 

**Example of a Case that Might Fail:**
- For input `2 0 1 2 1`, the expected output is `4` because the shortest path would go from `(0, 1)` to `(2, 1)` traversing the perimeter. However, if the transformation logic in `func_1` does not account for all direct paths correctly, it might return a different value.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases leading to incorrect distance calculations for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
