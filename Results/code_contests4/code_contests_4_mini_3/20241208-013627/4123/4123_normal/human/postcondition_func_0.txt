The function accepts two integer parameters, x and y, which represent coordinates on a square with side length n (where n is between 1 and 1000). It returns x if y is 0; if x equals n, it returns y + n; if y equals n, it returns 3n - x; otherwise, it returns 3n - y. The function does not handle cases where both x and y are equal to n, as it will default to the last return statement.
