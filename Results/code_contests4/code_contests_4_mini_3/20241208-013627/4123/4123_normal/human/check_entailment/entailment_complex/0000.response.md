The provided annotated Python program aims to compute the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square with side length `n`. However, upon analyzing the logic of the function, it becomes evident that it does not correctly implement the required functionality as outlined in the problem description.

### Explanation of the program's logic:
1. The function `func_1(x, y)` has several conditional checks based on the values of `y` and `x`:
   - If `y == 0`, it returns `x`.
   - If `x == n`, it returns `y + n`.
   - If `y == n`, it returns `n - x + n + n`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to returning `3n - y`.

### Issue with the program:
- The approach taken in the function does not account for the proper calculation of the shortest distance between two points on the sides of the square. The problem description implies that the shortest path must be calculated, taking into consideration the possible routes along the edges of the square.
- The program does not compute the distances appropriately when two points are on different edges or when they are on the same edge but separated. For instance, if (0, 0) and (n, n) are the input points, the correct distance should be 200, but the function's logic may not yield this result due to its simplistic conditional checks.
- The function lacks a comprehensive calculation for all possible paths that can connect the two points on the square's perimeter, resulting in incorrect outputs in certain cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not consistently perform as required by the problem description, as it fails to accurately calculate the shortest distance between points on the square. Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
