To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it in the context of the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a square with given coordinates on its sides.

### Program Code:
```python
(n, x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, raw_input().split())

def func_1(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    if x == n:
        return y + n
    if y == n:
        return n - x + n + n
    return n - y + n + n + n

print(func_1(x2, y2) - func_1(x1, y1) + 4 * n) % (4 * n)
```

### Output Hints:
The function `func_1` translates the coordinates into a linear representation of the square's perimeter. The hints mention that it handles various edge cases but does not account for the case when both coordinates are at (n, n).

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - When `y == 0`, it returns `x`, which is the distance from (0, 0) to the point on the bottom edge.
   - When `x == n`, it returns `y + n`, which accounts for the right edge.
   - When `y == n`, it returns `3n - x`, which is the distance from (n, n) back to the left edge.
   - For other cases, it calculates the distance assuming the point is on the left edge.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the scenario where both points are at (n, n) correctly. When both inputs are (n, n), the function will behave incorrectly as it does not have a specific condition for this case.

3. **Checking with the examples**:
   - For input `2 0 0 1 0`, the output is correctly `1`.
   - For input `2 0 1 2 1`, the output is correctly `4`.
   - For input `100 0 0 100 100`, the output is expected to be `200`, which is indeed calculated correctly.

### Conclusion:
While the program works correctly for the provided examples, the output hints suggest that there is a potential edge case (both points being at (n, n)) that the function does not correctly handle. Since the program does not account for every potential input case as required by the problem description, it cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program fails to handle the case where both points are at (n, n), which leads to an incorrect output in that scenario.
