Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square as described in the problem. The main issues with the program are as follows:

1. **Inadequate Handling of Points:** The function `func_1` seems to be designed to handle specific cases based on the position of the points (whether they are on the bottom, right, top, or left side of the square). However, it does not correctly account for all possible configurations of the two points given on the square's sides. For example, if both points are on the same side, the distance should be computed directly, but the logic in the function does not address this.

2. **Distance Calculation Logic:** The logic used for returning values is incorrect. For instance, the code snippet `return n - x + n + n` does not correctly calculate the distance from a point to another point on the square's perimeter. The shortest path should consider the wrap-around nature of the square's edges, and the function does not seem to implement this.

3. **Output Requirements:** The problem specifies that the output must be the shortest distance between the two points. The output values calculated by the program do not seem to correspond to the correct distances as outlined in the examples provided in the problem statement.

As a result, the program does not adhere to the requirements in the problem description and would give incorrect results for certain inputs, including cases like `(2, 0, 0, 1, 0)` or `(2, 0, 1, 2, 1)`. 

Thus, the program's logic fails to consistently calculate the shortest path around the square's perimeter, leading to an incorrect implementation.
