The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers. The function has multiple return cases:

- Case 1: The function returns the value of `x`, which is an integer representing one of the coordinates on the sides of a square with side length `n`.
- Case 2: If `y` is not equal to 0, the function returns the value of `y` added to the integer `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 1000.
- Case 3: If `x` is not equal to `n`, the function returns the result of the expression `n - x + n + n`.
- Case 4: If `y` is not equal to 0, the function returns `3n - y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `x` and `y` and return different values based on the conditions related to these parameters and the integer `n` (which is defined outside of the function). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, returning x if x is valid, y + n if y is not zero, n - x + 3n if x is not equal to n, and 3n - y if y is not zero.**
