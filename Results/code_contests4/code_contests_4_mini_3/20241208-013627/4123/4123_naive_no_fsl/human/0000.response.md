To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and the potential edge cases based on the problem description.

The problem requires calculating the shortest distance between two points on the perimeter of a square of side length `n`. The approach should account for the fact that the points can be located on any of the four sides of the square.

### Analysis of the Code
The function `func_1(x, y)` is designed to calculate some kind of distance based on the coordinates `(x, y)`:

1. **When `y == 0`**: It returns `x`.
2. **When `x == n`**: It returns `y + n`.
3. **When `y == n`**: It returns `n - x + n + n`, which simplifies to `2n - x`.
4. **Else**: It returns `n - y + n + n + n`, which simplifies to `3n - y`.

The output is calculated using the values returned by `func_1` for both points, adjusting for the perimeter of the square using `(4 * n)`.

### Potential Cases to Consider
1. **Adjacent Points**: For example, if both points are on the same side of the square:
   - Input: `2 0 0 1 0` (Output should be `1`)
   - The program correctly computes this as shown in the example.

2. **Points on Different Sides**: Points on adjacent sides should yield the correct minimum distance:
   - Input: `2 0 0 0 2` (Should be `2`)
   - The program's logic seems to be missing handling for this specific case since it only considers the corners and might compute incorrectly.

3. **Diagonal Opposite Corners**: For points on opposite corners of the square:
   - Input: `2 0 0 2 2` (Should be `4`)
   - The program should handle this case by considering the perimeter correctly.

4. **Full Wrap Around**: Points that require wrapping around the corners of the square:
   - Input: `2 2 0 0 2` (Should be `2`)
   - The program logic needs to be checked against this case.

### Conclusion
The logic used in the function `func_1` does not seem to correctly account for all scenarios, particularly when points are on different sides or when points are adjacent but on different sides of the square. 

As a specific counterexample, the point pair `(0, 2)` and `(2, 0)` should yield a distance of `4` (as they are diagonally across), but the calculation using `func_1` seems flawed for such configurations.

Therefore, since there are cases where the program may not produce the correct output for valid inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
