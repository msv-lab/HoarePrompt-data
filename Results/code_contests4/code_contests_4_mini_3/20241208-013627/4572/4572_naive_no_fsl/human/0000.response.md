To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we will break down the requirements and then review the code.

The problem description states:
- We need to find a minimum positive value \( x \) such that the polyline passes through the point \( (a, b) \).
- If no such \( x \) exists, we should return -1.
- The input consists of two positive integers \( a \) and \( b \).
- The output must be accurate to within \( 10^{-9} \).

Now, let's examine the provided code:

```python
(a, b) = map(float, raw_input().split())
if a < b:
    print - 1
    exit(0)
print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into two floating point numbers \( a \) and \( b \). The code uses `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3 (it should be `input()`).

2. **Condition Check**: The code checks if \( a < b \). If this condition is true, it prints -1 and exits. This means that if \( b \) is greater than \( a \), it assumes that it's impossible for the polyline to pass through the point \( (a, b) \). However, this is not necessarily true. For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), there could be a valid \( x \).

3. **Calculating \( x \)**: The expression `print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))` seems to attempt to compute the value of \( x \). However, the use of `math.floor` here might lead to incorrect values, especially if \( b \) is significantly smaller than \( a \), potentially yielding a division by zero if \( (a + b) / (2 * b) < 1 \).

### Potential Case Where Code Fails:
- Consider the input \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \). The code will print -1 because \( a < b \). However, if we analyze the polyline, there is indeed a valid \( x \) that allows the polyline to pass through the point \( (1, 2) \). 

This shows that the condition \( a < b \) is too strict and leads to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails for at least one input case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
