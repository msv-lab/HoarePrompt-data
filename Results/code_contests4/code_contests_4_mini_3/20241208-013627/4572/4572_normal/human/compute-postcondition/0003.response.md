The `exit(0)` command terminates the program immediately without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `a` and `b` remain the same, and the program exits successfully. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are floating-point numbers derived from the input values, `a` is less than `b`, and the program exits with status 0.**
