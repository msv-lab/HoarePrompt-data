The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` by converting the input values from a string to floats using `map(float, raw_input().split())`. The initial state indicates that `a` and `b` are positive integers, but after this line of code, they will be floating-point numbers. The original integer nature of `a` and `b` is thus changed to floats. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are now floating-point numbers derived from the input values. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are now floating-point numbers derived from the input values.**
