The function reads two floating-point numbers `a` and `b` from input. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `-1` and exits. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it calculates and prints the result of `(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))`. The function does not return a value but instead prints the result or exits early based on the condition.
