Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b` and, if true, it prints `-1` and exits. However, the problem states that we need to find the minimum positive value of `x` such that the polyline goes through the point `(a, b)`. Simply checking if `a` is less than `b` does not provide a valid basis for determining if such an `x` exists. There can be cases where `a >= b`, but there still might not be a valid `x` that satisfies the conditions.

2. **Calculation of `x`**: The formula used: `(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))` does not correspond to any meaningful derivation based on the description of how the polyline is constructed. The problem requires a more intricate understanding of the geometric properties of the polyline formed by the points described, and it does not simply reduce to the formula used in the program.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not output the result with the required precision as stated in the problem description. It does not format the output to ensure the result meets the precision requirements (absolute or relative error not exceeding 10^-9).

4. **No Handling for No Valid `x`**: The program does not properly handle the case where there is no valid `x`. It only checks if `a < b` and then defaults to outputting `-1`, but the logic to determine whether a suitable `x` exists is not implemented.

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary checks and calculations to correctly determine the minimum positive value of `x` as required by the problem description. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements and is incorrect.
