Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using `raw_input()`, which is not defined in Python 3. The correct function to read input in Python 3 is `input()`. This makes the program incompatible with the expected environment.

2. **Logic for Finding x**: The core logic to determine the minimum positive value of `x` based on the input values `a` and `b` is incorrect. The program simply calculates `(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))`, which does not relate to the conditions of the polyline described in the problem. The logic should involve conditions that check the relationship between `a` and `b` in the context of the polyline structure and how `x` can be derived from these values.

3. **Output Cases**: The program only checks if `a < b` to output `-1`, which is insufficient. The conditions under which there is no valid `x` must be more comprehensive based on the geometric properties of the polyline. 

4. **Mathematical Error**: The formula used does not account for the specific requirements of the problem, such as ensuring that `x` is a positive value that satisfies the conditions of the polyline. 

In summary, the program does not follow the problem description as it fails in both input handling and logic for calculating the required value of `x`.
