To assess the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need a function to find the minimum positive value of \( x \) such that the polyline defined by the points passes through a given point \( (a, b) \). If no such \( x \) exists, the function should return -1.

### Provided Program:
```python
(a, b) = map(float, raw_input().split())
if a < b:
    print - 1
    exit(0)
print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Check (`if a < b`)**:
   - If \( a < b \), the program immediately returns -1. 
   - This is a reasonable check since for the polyline described, \( b \) must not exceed \( a \).

2. **Calculation of \( x \)**:
   - The program calculates \( x \) using the formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{(a + b)}{(2 \cdot \text{math.floor}((a + b) / (2 \cdot b)))}
     \]
   - This calculation is intended to find the minimum \( x \) such that the point \( (a, b) \) lies on the polyline.

### Potential Issues:
- The use of `math.floor` can lead to incorrect calculations if \( a + b \) is not a multiple of \( 2b \). This could cause the calculation to yield an incorrect value for \( x \).
  
- **Example Case**:
   - Let's take \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 2 \):
     - \( a + b = 7 \)
     - \( 2b = 4 \)
     - \( \text{math.floor}(7 / 4) = 1 \)
     - Then:
       \[
       x = \frac{7}{2 \cdot 1} = 3.5
       \]
     - However, \( 3.5 \) is not guaranteed to be the minimum positive value of \( x \) satisfying the polyline condition.

- Another problematic case is when \( b = 0 \). Although the constraints specify \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \), if the implementation is tested with numbers close to these limits, the logic could potentially fail.

### Conclusion:
Given these points, the program does not accurately account for all potential cases and can yield incorrect results for certain values of \( a \) and \( b \). Thus, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
