To evaluate the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the core logic of the program and any potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find two distinct integers `a` and `b`, such that:
- `l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1`
- `l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2`
- `a ≠ b`

### Program Analysis
The relevant part of the program is in the function `func_15`, which processes each query. Here’s the breakdown:

1. It reads the number of queries `q`.
2. For each query, it reads the segment boundaries `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`.
3. It then calls `func_16(l1, r2)`.

However, `func_16` is defined to print values but not to return or store them. This means that while it prints `l1` and `r2`, it doesn't determine `a` and `b` effectively according to the problem's requirements.

### Potential Issues
1. **Distinctness Guarantee**: If `r2` (the maximum of the second segment) equals `l1` (the minimum of the first segment), then `a` and `b` would not be distinct (`a = l1` and `b = r2 = l1`), violating the requirement `a ≠ b`.
2. **Output Handling**: The program does not handle cases where it might need to choose different values based on the segments to ensure distinctness in all scenarios.

### Example Case
Let's consider an explicit case:
- Input: 
  ```
  1
  1 3 1 3
  ```
- Expected Output: 
  ```
  1 2
  ```
  or any pair like `2 1` or `3 1`.

However, if the function used `func_16(1, 3)` for this input, it would print `1` and `3`, leading us to a situation where `a` could equal `b`. 

### Conclusion
Given the identified logic flaws in handling distinct values and the output not matching the requirements of the problem, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to ensure that two distinct integers are selected from the given segments, particularly when the endpoints of the segments coincide.
