The function accepts no parameters and processes a specified number of queries, each involving two segments on the x-axis defined by four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2). For each query, it calls another function (func_16) with the values l1 and r2. The function does not return any results or values directly; it instead invokes func_16 for processing based on the segments defined in each query.
