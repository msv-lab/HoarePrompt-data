The function `func_6` initializes a thread that runs the `main` function. It does not return any value or process the input parameters `q`, `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, and `r_2`, which are implied in the annotations but not handled in the code. The function merely sets up the environment for multithreading without performing any calculations or returning any results based on those parameters.
