The function accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 500) and an integer `y`, and returns `x` raised to the power of the number of set bits in the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns 1 since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The function does not utilize the list of tuples mentioned in the annotations, and the loop operates on the integer `y` instead. Therefore, the function's behavior is solely dependent on the integer `y`, and it does not perform any operations on the list `y`.
