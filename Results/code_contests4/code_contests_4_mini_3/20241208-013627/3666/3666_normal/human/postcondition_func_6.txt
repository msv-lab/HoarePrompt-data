The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It does not handle cases where `n` could be 0 or negative, but since the function is designed to accept a positive integer, it will correctly compute and return the sum of the digits of `n`. If `n` is 0, it will return 0, and for any positive integer, it will sum the digits accordingly.
