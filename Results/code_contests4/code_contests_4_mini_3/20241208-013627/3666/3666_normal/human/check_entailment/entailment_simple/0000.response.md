Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The problem description requires finding two distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( l_1 \leq a \leq r_1 \), \( l_2 \leq b \leq r_2 \), and \( a \neq b \) for each query.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Functions without Implementation Logic**: Functions such as `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and others primarily handle input and do not perform the necessary logic to determine the values \( a \) and \( b \) based on the segments provided. They return input or intermediate values without computing the required outputs. 

2. **Missing Computation**: There is no function in the program that combines the input values and computes the distinct \( a \) and \( b \) as specified in the problem description. Instead, the program has many auxiliary functions that do not contribute to solving the task.

3. **Output Handling**: The function `func_16` appears to be designed for outputting values but is never called with the necessary parameters to output the results of the actual computation of \( a \) and \( b \).

4. **Guarantee of Existence**: The problem guarantees that an answer exists for every query. However, the provided functions do not utilize this guarantee to compute and return valid pairs \( (a, b) \).

In summary, the program lacks the core logic needed to solve the problem effectively. It does not find or print the required distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) for each query, which is a direct violation of the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is not correct.
