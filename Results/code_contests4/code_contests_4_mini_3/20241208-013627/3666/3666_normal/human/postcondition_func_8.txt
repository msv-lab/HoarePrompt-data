The function accepts an integer `x` and a list of tuples `y`, where each tuple contains four integers. It processes the list using the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) between `x` and the elements of `y`. The function returns the last non-zero value of `y` after the computation. If `y` is an empty list, the function would not execute properly, leading to potential errors instead of a defined output.
