The function accepts a list of tuples `x` and returns `True` if `x` is non-empty and contains exactly one element (as indicated by the bitwise operation `x & x - 1`), otherwise it returns `False`. If `x` is empty, it will return `False`. The annotations are misleading as they suggest that the function checks if `x` is empty or returns a specific boolean value based on the evaluation of `x`, but the actual behavior is more specific in evaluating whether there is exactly one tuple in the list.
