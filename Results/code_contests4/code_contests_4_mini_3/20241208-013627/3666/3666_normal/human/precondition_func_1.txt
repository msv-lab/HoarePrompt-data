The input consists of an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500), followed by q lines each containing four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9) representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis, with the constraints that l_{1_i} < r_{1_i} and l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.
