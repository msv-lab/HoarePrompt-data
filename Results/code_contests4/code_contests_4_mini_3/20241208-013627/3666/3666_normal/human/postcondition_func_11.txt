The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a tuple (0, 1) if `n` is 0. For positive values of `n`, it recursively calculates values based on the half of `n`. If `n` is odd, it returns the value of `c + 2 * d`, and if `n` is even, it returns `c + d`, where `c` and `d` are derived from the previous results. The function does not handle cases where `n` is negative or non-integer, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
