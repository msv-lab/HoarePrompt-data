The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers representing two segments. If the first element of list `a` is 0, it returns the list `b`, the integer 0, and the integer 1. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `b % a` and `a`, while also computing coefficients `x` and `y` using the Extended Euclidean algorithm. The function ultimately returns the gcd along with the computed values of `x` and `y`.
