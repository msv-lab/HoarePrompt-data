The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input, returning a map object of four integers representing the endpoints l1, r1, l2, and r2 of two segments on the x-axis. The function does not validate the input or check if the integers adhere to the stated constraints, such as ensuring that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
