The function accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It further checks divisibility against numbers of the form `6k Â± 1` up to the square root of `n`, returning `False` if any such divisor is found. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
