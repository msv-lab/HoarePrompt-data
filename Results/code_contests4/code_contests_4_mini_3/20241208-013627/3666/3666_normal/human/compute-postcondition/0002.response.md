The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables (`q`, `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2`, `sep`, and `file`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 500; `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_1` < `r_1`, 1 ≤ `l_2` < `r_2` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`; `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`; `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 500; `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_1` < `r_1`, 1 ≤ `l_2` < `r_2` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`; `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`; `at_start` is True.**
