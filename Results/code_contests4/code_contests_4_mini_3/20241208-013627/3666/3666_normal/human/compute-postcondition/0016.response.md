Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 500; `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_1` < `r_1`, 1 ≤ `l_2` < `r_2` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' '); file` is updated to include the value of `sep` along with the string representation of `x`; `file.write(str(x))` has been executed, writing the string representation of `x` to `file`; `at_start` is False; if `at_start` is False, then `file.write(sep)` has been executed, writing `sep` to `file`.***
