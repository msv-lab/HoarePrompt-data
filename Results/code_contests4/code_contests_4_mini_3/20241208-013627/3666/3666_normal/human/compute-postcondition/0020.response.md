Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 500; `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_1` < `r_1`, 1 ≤ `l_2` < `r_2` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' '); `file` is updated to contain the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a possibly empty iterable; `file` is written with `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`.**
