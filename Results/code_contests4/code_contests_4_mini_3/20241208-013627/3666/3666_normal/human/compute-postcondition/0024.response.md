The function `func_16` accepts a parameter `q`, which is an integer constrained to the range 1 ≤ q ≤ 500. For each query associated with `q`, the function considers four integers: `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, and `r_2`, with the following constraints: 1 ≤ l_1 < r_1 and 1 ≤ l_2 < r_2 ≤ 10^9. 

The function processes the input queries and returns results based on the provided integer ranges. However, since the specific output values or conditions for returning results are not defined, we cannot specify them further.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `q` representing the number of queries and processes each query consisting of four integers `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, and `r_2`, all adhering to the specified constraints.**
