Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 500, `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_1` < `r_1`, 1 ≤ `l_2` < `r_2` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `file` now contains the string representation of `x`, and `file` is updated to include the value of `sep`.**
