The value of `c[a[r]]` is increased by 1. The previous value of `c[a[r]]` is not specified, but it will now be one unit higher. The conditions regarding `b[a[r]]` and `t` are also not specified, so we cannot determine if `t` will change. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n` and greater than 1; `r` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1; c[a[r]]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n` and greater than 1; `r` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1; c[a[r]]` is increased by 1.**
