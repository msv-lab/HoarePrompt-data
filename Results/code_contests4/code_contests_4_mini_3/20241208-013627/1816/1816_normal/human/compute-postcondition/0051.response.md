The value of `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c[a[r]]` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`ans`, `r`, `l`, `s`, `n`, `b`, `a`, `c`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `r - l + 1 - s`; `c[a[l]]` is decremented by 1; `r` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` or `c[a[l]]` is no longer less than `b[a[l]]`; `c[a[r]]` is increased by 1.
