The variable `c` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `m`. Since `m` is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ n`, the list `c` will contain `m` zeros. The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a map of integers derived from input values, each decremented by 1; `b` is a map of integers derived from input values; `s` is the sum of the values in map `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` initialized with zeros.**
