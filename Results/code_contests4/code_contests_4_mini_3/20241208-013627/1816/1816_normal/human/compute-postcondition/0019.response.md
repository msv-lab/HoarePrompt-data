According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t` and `r`. The loop can execute again if both conditions `t > 0` and `r + 1 < n` are satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `t` is greater than 0, and since `r` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `r + 1` is less than `n`. Therefore, both conditions are satisfied, and the loop can indeed execute one more time without needing any adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `m` â‰¤ `n` and greater than 1; `r` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1; c[a[r]]` is increased by 1; if `c[a[r]]` is equal to `b[a[r]]`, then `t` is decreased by 1**.
