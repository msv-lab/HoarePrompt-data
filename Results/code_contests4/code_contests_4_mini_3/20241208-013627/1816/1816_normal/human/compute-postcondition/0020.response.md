The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `r` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`. Therefore, after execution, `r` will be at least 2 and still less than `n - 1`. The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `c`, `b`, and `t` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n` and greater than 1; `r` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1; c[a[r]]` is increased by 1; if `c[a[r]]` is equal to `b[a[r]]`, then `t` is decreased by 1**
