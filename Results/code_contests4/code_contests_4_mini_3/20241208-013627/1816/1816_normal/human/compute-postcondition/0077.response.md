Output State: **`r` is such that `r + 1` is equal to `n`, `c[a[r]]` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]` at the conclusion of the loop, `l` remains incremented by 1, and `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
