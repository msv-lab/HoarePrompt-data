According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, there is no specific information given about the values of `l` and `r`. However, since the loop condition is `l <= r`, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must remain less than or equal to `r`. 

Given that the program state mentions `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `r - l + 1 - s`, there are no adjustments that need to be made to `ans` for the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, `l` should be less than or equal to `r`. 

State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `r - l + 1 - s`, and for the loop to execute again `l` must be less than or equal to `r`**.
