The variable `b` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means that `b` will be a map object containing integers derived from the input values. The values will be split from the input string and converted to integers. The variables `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a map of integers derived from input values, each decremented by 1; `b` is a map of integers derived from input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a map of integers derived from input values, each decremented by 1; `b` is a map of integers derived from input values.**
