Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a map of integers derived from input values, each decremented by 1; `b` is a map of integers derived from input values; `s` is the sum of the values in map `b`; `c` is a map with an updated count for `a[l]` (decremented by 1); `l` is 0; `r` is at least `m - 1` and less than `n`; `ans` is `r + 1 - s`; `t` is greater than 0.**
