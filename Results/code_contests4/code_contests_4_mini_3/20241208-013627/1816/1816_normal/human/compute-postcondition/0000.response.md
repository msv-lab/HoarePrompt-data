The code `n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a single line of input and splits it into two parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to `n` and `m`. The previous values of `n` and `m` are unknown, but we know that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq n\). Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n` and `m` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`**
