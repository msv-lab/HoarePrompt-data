In this code snippet, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the expression `r - l + 1 - s`. The variable `l` has been incremented by 1, which means its value has changed from its previous state. 

Given the initial state:
- `r` is less than `n`
- `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`
- `ans` is the minimum value calculated during the loop
- `l` has been incremented by 1

The expression `r - l + 1 - s` will yield a new value based on the updated `l` and the current values of `r` and `s`. Since `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the calculated expression, the output state reflects this change without specific numerical outputs for the variables.

Thus, the Output State is: **`r` is less than `n`, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `ans` is the minimum value updated, `l` is incremented by 1.**
