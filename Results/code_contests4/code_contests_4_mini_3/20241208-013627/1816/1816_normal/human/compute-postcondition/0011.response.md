Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a map of integers derived from input values, each decremented by 1; `b` is a map of integers derived from input values; `s` is the sum of the values in map `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` initialized with zeros; `l` is 0; `r` is 0; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m`; `c[a[r]]` has been incremented by 1, and `c[a[r]]` is equal to `b[a[r]]`.***
