The variable `t` is assigned the value of `m`. Since `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `t` will also take on a value within that range. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a map of integers derived from input values, each decremented by 1; `b` is a map of integers derived from input values; `s` is the sum of the values in map `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` initialized with zeros; `l` is 0, `r` is -1; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a map of integers derived from input values, each decremented by 1; `b` is a map of integers derived from input values; `s` is the sum of the values in map `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` initialized with zeros; `l` is 0, `r` is -1; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m`.**
