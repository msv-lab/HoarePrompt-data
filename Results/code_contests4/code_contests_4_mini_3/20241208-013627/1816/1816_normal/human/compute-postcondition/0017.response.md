The variable `t` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `t` is not specified, but it is assumed to be at least 1 since `t` is a variable that typically represents a count or a number of iterations. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `c[a[r]]` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `m` is greater than 1; `r` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1; c[a[r]]` is increased by 1; `t` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `m` is greater than 1; `r` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1; c[a[r]]` is increased by 1; `t` is decreased by 1.**
