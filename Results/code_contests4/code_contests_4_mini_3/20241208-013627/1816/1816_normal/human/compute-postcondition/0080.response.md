Output State: **`r` is such that `r + 1` is equal to `n`, `c[a[r]]` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and if `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans` is updated to min(ans, r - l + 1 - s).**
