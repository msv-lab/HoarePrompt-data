The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `r` is unknown, but it is specified that `r` is less than `n - 1`. Other variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `m` is greater than 1; `r` is increased by 1 and is now at least 1 and less than `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `m` is greater than 1; `r` is increased by 1 and is now at least 1 and less than `n - 1.**
