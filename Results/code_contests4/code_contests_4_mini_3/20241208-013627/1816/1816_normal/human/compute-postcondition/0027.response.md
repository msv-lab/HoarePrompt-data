The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No values of the variables are changed or returned as the program stops execution. The output state reflects the current state of the variables, noting that execution has ended.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a map of integers derived from input values, each decremented by 1; `b` is a map of integers derived from input values; `s` is the sum of the values in map `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` containing the counts of occurrences of each element from `a` that has been processed; `l` is 0; `r` is at least `m - 1` and less than `n`; `ans` is -1; `t` is greater than 0; the program has terminated.**
