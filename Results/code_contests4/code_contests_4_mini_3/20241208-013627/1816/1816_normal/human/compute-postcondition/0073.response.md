The value of `r` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables are not affected in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is now 3; `c[a[r]]` is increased by 1; `n` is greater than 3; `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`.

Output State: **`r` is now 3; `c[a[r]]` is increased by 1; `n` is greater than 3; `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]**
