Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the input values, which includes the number of Jedi Knights `n`, the number of colors `m`, the colors of the lightsabers in a list `a`, and the required counts of each color in a list `b`. This matches the input specifications in the problem statement.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the necessary variables, including a count list `c` to track the occurrences of each color in the current window of knights. This is essential for maintaining the count of Jedi Knights with specific lightsaber colors.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**: The program employs a two-pointer (or sliding window) approach to find the contiguous interval of Jedi Knights. It expands the right pointer `r` to include more Jedi Knights until the counts of the required colors are met (i.e., when `t` becomes 0). This is consistent with the requirement to find a contiguous interval of knights.

4. **Count Validation**: After expanding the window, the program checks if it can contract the window by moving the left pointer `l` while still maintaining the required counts. This step is essential in ensuring that the minimum number of Jedi Knights is removed, as it calculates the minimum interval that satisfies the conditions laid out in `b`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program computes the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed (`ans`) and prints the result. If it's impossible to form such an interval, it correctly outputs `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles various edge cases, such as when the total number of required knights exceeds the available knights or when the counts cannot be matched due to the colors available.

Overall, the program effectively implements the logic necessary to fulfill the problem's requirements, ensuring that it can find the minimum number of Jedi Knights to be removed or return `-1` if no valid interval exists. Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
