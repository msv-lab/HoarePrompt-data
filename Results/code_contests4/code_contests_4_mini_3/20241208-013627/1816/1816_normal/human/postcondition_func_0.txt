The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of lightsabers, an integer `m` representing the number of different colors, a list `a` of integers representing the colors of the lightsabers, and a list `b` of integers representing the desired counts of Jedi Knights for each color. It calculates the minimum number of lightsabers needed to satisfy the desired counts. If it is not possible to satisfy the desired counts with the given lightsabers, it returns -1. The function effectively determines the smallest window of lightsabers that meets the requirements specified in `b`.
