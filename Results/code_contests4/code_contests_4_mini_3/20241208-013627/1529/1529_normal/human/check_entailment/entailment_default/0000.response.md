To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description
We need to find three integers \( a, b, c \) from four given numbers which represent their pairwise sums and the total sum. The four numbers will include \( a+b \), \( a+c \), \( b+c \), and \( a+b+c \).

### Program Code
```python
numbers = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
numbers.sort()
print('{0} {1} {2}'.format(numbers[3] - numbers[0], numbers[3] - numbers[1], numbers[3] - numbers[2]))
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integers from input, which is correct as per the problem description.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts these four numbers. This is a reasonable step to identify the maximum value and make calculations easier.
3. **Calculating \( a, b, c \)**: 
   - The largest number in the sorted list corresponds to \( a+b+c \).
   - The other three numbers correspond to the pairwise sums \( a+b \), \( a+c \), and \( b+c \).
   - By subtracting the smallest number from the largest number, we get \( c \) (assuming the sorted numbers are \( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \) where \( x_4 = a+b+c \)).
   - Similarly, the other two subtractions yield \( b \) and \( a \). This logic seems sound.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Values**: The minimum inputs (2, 2, 2, 2) would yield \( a = b = c = 1 \), which is valid.
2. **Equal Values**: Cases where all four numbers are equal (like \( 40, 40, 40, 60 \)) would yield \( a = b = c = 20 \), which is also valid.
3. **Different Combinations**: The program should correctly handle different combinations of sums. For example, if the numbers are \( 3, 6, 5, 4 \), the expected output should be \( 2, 1, 3 \), which can be computed correctly with the logic.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function computes the differences between the largest number and each of the other three numbers. This aligns with our understanding of how the sums work.

### Conclusion
The logic in the program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases discussed. The edge cases provided do not reveal any flaws in the program's logic.

Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly computes three integers \( a, b, c \) from the four given numbers, satisfying the problem requirements without missing any edge cases.
