To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func()` function.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have three positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
2. We are given four numbers that consist of their pairwise sums and the total sum:
   - Pairwise sums: \(a + b\), \(a + c\), \(b + c\)
   - Total sum: \(a + b + c\)
3. The task is to derive \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from these four numbers.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program reads four integers from input and stores them in a list called `numbers`.
2. It then sorts these numbers.
3. The program calculates the values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the following:
   - \(a = (a + b + c) - (b + c)\) which simplifies to \(numbers[3] - numbers[2]\)
   - \(b = (a + b + c) - (a + c)\) which simplifies to \(numbers[3] - numbers[1]\)
   - \(c = (a + b + c) - (a + b)\) which simplifies to \(numbers[3] - numbers[0]\)

### Correctness Validation:
- The largest number in the sorted list (`numbers[3]`) corresponds to \(a + b + c\).
- The other three numbers are the pairwise sums.
- By subtracting the appropriate pairwise sum from the total sum, we derive the original integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to derive the integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the four provided sums. Since all calculations are based on guaranteed mathematical relationships between the numbers, the program will always produce valid integers that meet the output criteria specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
