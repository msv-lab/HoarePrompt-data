The provided program reads four integers, sorts them, and computes the differences between the largest number and the other three numbers. However, let's analyze whether this approach correctly deduces the integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from the sums on the board.

According to the problem description, we have four numbers which include the pairwise sums \( a + b \), \( a + c \), \( b + c \), and the total sum \( a + b + c \). The program attempts to derive \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) by taking the largest number (which is assumed to be \( a + b + c \)) and subtracting the other three numbers from it.

Let's denote the four input numbers as follows:
- Let \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) be the pairwise sums: \( a + b \), \( a + c \), \( b + c \) (in some order).
- Let \( x_4 \) be the total sum: \( a + b + c \).

When sorted, we can assume:
1. \( numbers[0] \) is the smallest pairwise sum (e.g., \( a + b \)).
2. \( numbers[1] \) is the second smallest (e.g., \( a + c \)).
3. \( numbers[2] \) is the third smallest (e.g., \( b + c \)).
4. \( numbers[3] \) is the largest (which we assume to be \( a + b + c \)).

The program then computes:
- \( a = numbers[3] - numbers[0] \)
- \( b = numbers[3] - numbers[1] \)
- \( c = numbers[3] - numbers[2] \)

This computation assumes that:
- \( a + b + c - (a + b) = c \)
- \( a + b + c - (a + c) = b \)
- \( a + b + c - (b + c) = a \)

These equations hold true because of the properties of the sums.

**However**, while the logic appears sound, the implementation relies on the assumption that the largest number is always \( a + b + c \), which is true given the problem guarantees that the answer exists. Thus, the calculated values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) will always yield valid non-negative integers, as the problem states that \( a, b, c \) are positive integers.

Therefore, the program effectively meets the requirements set forth in the problem description, as it outputs three integers that correspond to the original integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

Correctness: **True**
