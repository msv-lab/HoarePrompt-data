The `numbers` list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4` can be in any random order initially, but after the sorting operation, `numbers` will contain these integers in ascending order. The specific values of `x_i` are not known, but they remain within the range of 2 to 10^9.

Output State: **`x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4` are four positive integers such that 2 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 10^9; `numbers` is now sorted in ascending order.**
