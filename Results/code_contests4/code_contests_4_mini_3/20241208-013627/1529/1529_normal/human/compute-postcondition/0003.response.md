The function `func` does not accept any parameters as defined in its signature. Instead, it operates with four positive integers, denoted as `x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4`, which are subject to the constraint that each integer must be within the range 2 to 10^9. The function's output is not explicitly described, so we cannot ascertain its return value based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with four positive integers within a specified range, but the return value is not provided.**
