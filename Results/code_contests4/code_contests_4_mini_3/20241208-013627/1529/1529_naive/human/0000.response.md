To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and the requirements:

### Problem Description
Polycarp has three positive integers \( a, b, c \). He writes down their pairwise sums and the total sum on a board in arbitrary order. The task is to determine the original numbers \( a, b, c \) from the four numbers written down.

### Program Analysis
The program takes four integers as input (which are the sums of pairs and the total) and does the following:
1. It reads the inputs and converts them to integers.
2. It sorts the numbers.
3. It calculates and prints the three integers \( a, b, c \) using the formula:
   - \( a = \text{total} - (b+c) \)
   - \( b = \text{total} - (a+c) \)
   - \( c = \text{total} - (a+b) \)
   
   Here, `numbers[3]` represents the total sum \( a+b+c \), and the other three numbers represent the pairwise sums \( a+b, a+c, b+c \).

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
1. The program uses `numbers[3] - numbers[i]` where \( i \) ranges from 0 to 2 to calculate \( a, b, c \). This assumes that after sorting, the last number (index 3) will always be the total sum. This is correct because the problem guarantees that the input will always contain a valid set of sums.

2. However, since the program is expected to handle any order of inputs and produce the correct positive integers, we must ensure that the results are indeed positive integers. The subtraction logic should guarantee positive results as long as the input sums are valid.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to derive \( a, b, c \) from the sorted sums. Given the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem description, I don't see any edge cases where the program will fail to provide valid integers or will produce negative or zero values.

Thus, I conclude that the program meets the requirements as specified.

Correctness: **True**.
