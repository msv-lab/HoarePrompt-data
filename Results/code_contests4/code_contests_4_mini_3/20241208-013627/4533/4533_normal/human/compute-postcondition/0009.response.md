Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `floors` contains at least 1 integer; `m` is the maximum of `h` and 0 (updated to be the maximum of the new `h` and the previous `m`); `s` has one additional formatted string element based on the updated `m` and `h`, calculated as '%i' % (m - h + 1 if m - h + 1 > 0 else 0).**
