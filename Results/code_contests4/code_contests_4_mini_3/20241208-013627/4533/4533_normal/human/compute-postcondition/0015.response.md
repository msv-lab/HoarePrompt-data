The function `func` does not have any parameters that are explicitly passed to it. However, it involves the variables `n` and `h`, where `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of elements in the list `h`, and `h` is a list containing `n` positive integers. Each integer in the list satisfies the condition that it is between 1 and 10^9. 

Given this, the functionality of the function is likely to perform some computation or operation based on the values of `n` and the list `h`, but specifics about the output are not provided in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function works with a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list `h` of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^9) but does not take any parameters directly. The exact return value is unspecified.**
