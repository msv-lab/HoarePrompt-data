The variable `m` is assigned the value `0`. Other variables, `n` and `floors`, remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `floors` is a map object containing integers from input; `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `floors` is a map object containing integers from input; `m` is 0**
