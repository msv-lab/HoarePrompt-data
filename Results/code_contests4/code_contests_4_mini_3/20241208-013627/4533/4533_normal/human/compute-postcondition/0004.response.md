According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `floors` map object. The loop will iterate over the elements in `floors` in reverse order. For the loop to execute at least once, `floors` must contain at least one element. Since `n` is a positive integer and does not directly affect the execution of the loop, it is not necessary to adjust it. The current state of `m` and `s` does not impact the loop execution either.

To ensure that the loop executes, `floors` should not be empty. Thus, the state can be adjusted to include a condition that confirms the presence of elements in `floors`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `floors` is a map object containing at least 1 integer, `m` is 0, `s` is an empty list**
