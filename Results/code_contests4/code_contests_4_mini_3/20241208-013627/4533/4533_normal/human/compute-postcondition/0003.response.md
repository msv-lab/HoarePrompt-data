The variable `s` is assigned an empty list. The other variables `n`, `floors`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `floors` is a map object containing integers from input; `m` is 0; `s` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `floors` is a map object containing integers from input; `m` is 0; `s` is an empty list**.
