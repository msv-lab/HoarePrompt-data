The variable `floors` is assigned the result of `map(int, sys.stdin.next().split(' '))`, which means it will hold a map object containing integers converted from a space-separated string of numbers read from `sys.stdin.next()`. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, but it does not directly affect the variable `floors`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `floors` will contain a map of integers based on the input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `floors` is a map object containing integers from input.**
