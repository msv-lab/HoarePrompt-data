To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze both the code and the description closely.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine how many floors need to be added to each building in order for it to be classified as "luxurious." A building is considered luxurious if its number of floors is strictly greater than all buildings to its right. 

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of buildings and their respective number of floors. It then processes the buildings in reverse order (from the last building to the first) to calculate the number of floors needed for each building to become luxurious.

1. The program initializes `m` to keep track of the maximum number of floors seen so far from the right.
2. For each building's floor height `h`, it calculates how many floors need to be added using the formula:
   - `m - h + 1` if `m - h + 1 > 0` else `0`.
3. It appends this value to a list `s`, which is later reversed to match the original order of the buildings before printing.

### Edge Cases
- If there is only one building (n=1), it should always be luxurious since there are no buildings to its right. The code should return `0` in this case.
- If all buildings have the same number of floors, the result should indicate that all but the last building need to have additional floors to be considered luxurious.

### Output Hints
The output hints suggest that the function correctly calculates the difference between the maximum floor value seen so far and the current floor, ensuring it is at least zero, and prints the results in reverse order. 

### Verification of Output Hints Against the Code
The output hints align with the logic in the code:
- The code indeed processes the input correctly, computes the required values, and handles the case of needing zero floors added when a building is already luxurious.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the program and considering the edge cases, it appears that the code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The handling of both the general case and edge cases are accounted for, particularly in how it calculates the necessary floors to add.

Correctness: **True**.
