The given program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. 

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem Description:**
   - A house is considered luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than all the houses to its right.
   - For each house, we need to determine how many additional floors need to be added to make it luxurious. If it is already luxurious, the answer should be zero.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The program reads the number of houses (`n`) and the list of floors (`h`).
   - It iterates over the list of floors in reverse order and calculates a value for each house based on the maximum number of floors encountered so far (`m`).
   - Specifically, it appends to the list `s` the value `m - h + 1`, adjusted to be at least zero.

3. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The calculation of `m - h + 1` does not accurately reflect the number of floors needed to make the current house luxurious.
   - The correct number of floors needed should be computed as `max(0, (max_floors_to_the_right + 1 - current_floor))`, where `max_floors_to_the_right` is the maximum number of floors in all houses to the right of the current house.
   - The program instead simply keeps track of the maximum seen so far and does not consider the actual maximum to the right.

4. **Counter Example:**
   - Consider the input `4` followed by the heights `3 2 1 4`.
   - The expected output should be `2 3 4 0`, indicating how many floors need to be added to each house to make it luxurious.
   - However, the current implementation would incorrectly calculate values based on the maximum of all seen so far, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Since the logic used in the program does not correctly address the requirements laid out in the problem description, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
