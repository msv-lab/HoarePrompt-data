To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have `n` houses, each with a certain number of floors.
2. A house is luxurious if it has more floors than all houses to its right.
3. For each house, we need to determine how many additional floors are needed to make it luxurious.
4. If a house is already luxurious, we return 0 for that house.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads `n` and a list of floor counts for the houses.
2. It processes the list of floors in reverse order (from the rightmost house to the leftmost).
3. It maintains a variable `m` which tracks the maximum number of floors seen so far to the right (starting with the rightmost house).
4. For each house (when traversed in reverse):
   - It calculates how many floors need to be added to make the current house luxurious.
   - It appends the result to a list `s`.
   - It updates `m` to be the maximum between the current house's floors and the previous maximum `m`.

### Calculation Logic:
- For a house with `h_i` floors:
  - If `h_i` is already greater than `m` (the maximum of the right-side houses), then it is luxurious, and we append `0` to the results.
  - If not, we compute how many floors are needed as `m - h_i + 1`, which is the difference needed to exceed the maximum right-side house plus one (to make it strictly greater).
  
### Reverse Order:
- The results are constructed in reverse order and are then reversed back before printing, ensuring the outputs correspond to the original order of houses.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly identifies whether each house is luxurious or not based on the condition provided in the problem.
- It accounts for the cases where no additional floors are needed (already luxurious) and correctly computes the necessary additional floors when needed.
- The logic adheres to the constraints and expected outputs defined in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description. It will yield correct results for all valid inputs as defined by the constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
