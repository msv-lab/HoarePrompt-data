The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers from standard input, then calculates a new list where each element represents the difference between the maximum floor value seen so far and the current floor, adjusted to be at least zero. Finally, it prints this list in reverse order as a space-separated string. The function does not explicitly return any value.
