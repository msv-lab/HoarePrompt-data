n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12; the first participant communicates n pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 9; the second participant communicates m pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 9; each pair consists of two different integers, and there exists exactly one common integer in the pairs communicated by both participants.
