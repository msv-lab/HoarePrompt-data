The function reads two sets of pairs of distinct integers and checks for a shared integer between one pair from the first set and one pair from the second set. If exactly one valid match is found in either set, it returns the shared integer; otherwise, it returns 0. If there are conflicting matches that violate the pair conditions, the function exits with -1.
