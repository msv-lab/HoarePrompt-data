n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12; the first set consists of n pairs of distinct integers in the range from 1 to 9; the second set consists of m pairs of distinct integers in the range from 1 to 9; all pairs within each set are distinct and no pair contains the same number twice; it is guaranteed that there is a pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.
