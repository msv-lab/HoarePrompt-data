Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 1`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, `-1` is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, `-1` is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, provided that `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, in which case no changes are made to `B[i][0]` or `B[i][1]`.***
