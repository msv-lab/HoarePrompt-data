The statement `B[i][0] += 1` increments the value at index `[0]` of the list `B` at index `i` by 1. The variables `n`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `n` is an integer from 1 to 12 and `j` is defined as `j_current + 2`, we can confirm that these variables remain unchanged in this context. 

Therefore, the output state remains focused on the modification within the array `B`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 2; B[i][0]` is incremented by 1.**
