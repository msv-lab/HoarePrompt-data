The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous values of `i` is 1, and `x1` is an unspecified value. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
