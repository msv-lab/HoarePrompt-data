Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2, and `a` is not defined. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits without further execution. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, but the operation on `B[i][0]` could not be executed due to `a` being undefined.***
