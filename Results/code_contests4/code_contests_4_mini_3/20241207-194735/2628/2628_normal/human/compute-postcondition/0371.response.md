Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; if the sum of the first elements of `A` equals 1 or the sum of the first elements of `B` equals 1, `ans` holds the value of the second element of the last `Bi` for which `Bi[0]` equals 1, or remains unchanged if no such `Bi` exists, and `ans` is printed. Otherwise, `n` and `m` remain integers from 1 to 12, the sum of the first elements of `A` is not equal to 1, the sum of the first elements of `B` is not equal to 1, and 0 has been printed.***
