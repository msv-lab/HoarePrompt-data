Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` is assigned the value from `a[1]`, `y1` is assigned the value from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found, `A[i][1]` holds the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1` based on the conditions met during the iterations, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`, and either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2.`***
