The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, and the program stops execution without returning any values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2, `a` is not defined; -1 is printed, and the program exits without any further execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2, `a` is not defined; -1 is printed, and the program exits without any further execution.**
