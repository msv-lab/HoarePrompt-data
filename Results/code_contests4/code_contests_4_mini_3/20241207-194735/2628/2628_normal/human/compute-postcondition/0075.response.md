Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the value from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, then -1 has been printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `x1`, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, with the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` remaining unequal.***
