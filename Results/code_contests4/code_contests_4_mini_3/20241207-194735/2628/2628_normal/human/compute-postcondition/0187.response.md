The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The initial state indicates that `x1` is either equal to `x2` or `y2`, and the values of `B[i][1]` can either be 0 or equal to `x1`. Therefore, after execution, `B[i][1]` will be updated to the value of `x1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, either `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`.**
