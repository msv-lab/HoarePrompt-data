The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are changed or assigned new values, but the execution stops. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]` and -1 is printed, and the program exits.
