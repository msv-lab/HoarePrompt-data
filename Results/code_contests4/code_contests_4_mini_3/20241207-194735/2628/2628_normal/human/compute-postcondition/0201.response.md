According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range of `n`, which is an integer from 1 to 12. The loop will execute again if the current value of `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value (let's denote it as `j_current`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j_current` must be less than `n`. 

If `j_current` is equal to `n - 1`, the next value of `j` will be `n`, which will cause the loop to exit. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

If `j_current` is `n - 1`, then after incrementing, `j` will be `n`, and the loop will not execute again. Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `j` should be adjusted to `j_current + 1`, which means it will be equal to `n` after the next increment.

State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`, and `j` is `j_current + 1`**
