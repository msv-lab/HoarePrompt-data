The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, and we exit the program as is. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]` and -1 has been printed; the program has exited.**
