Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. The value of `A[i][1]` is either 0 or equal to `x1`.***
