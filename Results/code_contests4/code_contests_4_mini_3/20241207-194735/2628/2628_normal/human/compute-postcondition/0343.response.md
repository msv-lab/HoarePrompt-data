Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[n-1]`. If the set of elements in `b[2]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]` for any `j`, `B[2][0]` will be incremented for each match found during the iterations, and `B[2][1]` will hold either `x1` or `y1` based on the last matching condition. If at any point the conditions for printing -1 are met, the program exits. If no matches occur for all iterations, `B[2][0]` will remain unchanged.**
