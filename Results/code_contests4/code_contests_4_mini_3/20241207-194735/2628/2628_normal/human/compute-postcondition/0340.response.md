Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2, and `a` is not defined. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits without further execution. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, but the operation on `B[i][0]` could not be executed due to `a` being undefined. If the condition is not met, the program continues without any change to `B[i][1]` or `B[i][0]`.***
