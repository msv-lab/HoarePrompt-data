Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`, and the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1` and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
