Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[2][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
