The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program. The values of the variables do not change before the exit. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a` at index `j`, which is 1; -1 is printed and the program exits.
