Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 3, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[3]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
