Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `A` is a list with at least `n` elements, and `Ai` is the first element of `A`. If the first element of `Ai` is equal to 1, then `ans` is set to the second element of `Ai`. If the first element of `Ai` is not equal to 1, there is no change to `ans`.***
