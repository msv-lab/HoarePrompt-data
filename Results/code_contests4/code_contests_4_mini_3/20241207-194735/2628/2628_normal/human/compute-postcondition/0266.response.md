The variable `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `i` is 1, so `B[1][0]` is affected. The values of `n`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`; `B[1][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`; `B[1][0]` is increased by 1.**
