The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but no further processing occurs after this point. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the program is exiting.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 2`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `a` at index `j`; and the program exits.**
