Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, then `y2` is set to -1 and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[1][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, which is undefined.***
