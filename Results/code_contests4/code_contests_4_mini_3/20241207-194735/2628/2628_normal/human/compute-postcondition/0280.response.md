The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that the values of the variables do not change, and the program stops execution without returning any further values or results. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current values of the variables and indicates that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]` and -1 is printed; the program has exited.**
