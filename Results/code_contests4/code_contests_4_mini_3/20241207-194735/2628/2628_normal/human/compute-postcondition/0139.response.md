The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `y1` is either equal to `x2` or `y2`, it could take on a specific value based on the conditions stated in the initial state, but the exact value is not defined. Therefore, the impact is that `A[i][1]` now holds the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
