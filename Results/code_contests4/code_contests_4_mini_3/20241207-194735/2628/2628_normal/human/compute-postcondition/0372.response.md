The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It works with two predefined sets of pairs of distinct integers, where the first set consists of `n` pairs and the second set consists of `m` pairs, both within the specified integer constraints. The function identifies and returns the shared number that exists in both sets, which is guaranteed to be exactly one. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to identify and return the single common integer found in one pair from the first set and one pair from the second set. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the integer that is shared between one pair from the first set of pairs and one pair from the second set of pairs.**
