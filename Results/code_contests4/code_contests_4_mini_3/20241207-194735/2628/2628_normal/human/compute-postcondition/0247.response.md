Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, and neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`. Furthermore, the second element of `B[i]` is not 0 and is not equal to `y1`.***
