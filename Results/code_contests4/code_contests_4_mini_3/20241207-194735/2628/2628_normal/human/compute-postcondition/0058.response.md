Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`; `m` is greater than 2; `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are now assigned values from `b[2]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
