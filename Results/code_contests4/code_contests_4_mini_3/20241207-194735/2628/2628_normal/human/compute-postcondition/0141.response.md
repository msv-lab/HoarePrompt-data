Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, and either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
