Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2, and `a` is not defined. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; if `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `x1`, no changes occur. In the case where the sets are equal, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, but no operation on `B[i][0]` can occur due to `a` being undefined. If none of these conditions are met, the program continues without any changes to `B[i][1]` or `B[i][0]`.***
