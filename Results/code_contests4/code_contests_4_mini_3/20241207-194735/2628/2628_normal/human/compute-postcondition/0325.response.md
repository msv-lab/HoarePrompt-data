Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a` at index `j`, which is 1. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
