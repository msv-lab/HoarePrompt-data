Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[0][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[0][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
