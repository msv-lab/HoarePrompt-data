Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits without modifying any variable values. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
