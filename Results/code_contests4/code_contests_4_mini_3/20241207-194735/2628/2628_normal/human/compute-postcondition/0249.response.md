The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged as the program does not continue beyond this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, the second element of `B[i]` is not 0 and is not equal to `y1`, and -1 has been printed. The program has exited.
