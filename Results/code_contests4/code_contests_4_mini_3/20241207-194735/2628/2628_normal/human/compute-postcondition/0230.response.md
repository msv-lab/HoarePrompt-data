Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 2`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `a` at index `j`. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` equals `x2` or `y2`, if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed, and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` does not equal `x2` or `y2`, then if `y1` equals `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
