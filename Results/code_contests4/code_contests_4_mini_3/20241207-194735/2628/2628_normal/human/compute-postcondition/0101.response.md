Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. In the else case, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, the output is -1. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
