According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. Since `j` is currently 0, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
