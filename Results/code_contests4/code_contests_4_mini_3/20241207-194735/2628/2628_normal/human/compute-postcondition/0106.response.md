The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are altered as a result of this command. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables before the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 3, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[3]`, and -1 is printed before exiting.**
