The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` do not change as a result of the `exit()` call, but the program stops running. The state of the variables remains unchanged, and we note that -1 is printed before the exit. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a` at index `j`, which is 1; -1 is printed and the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a` at index `j`, which is 1; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
