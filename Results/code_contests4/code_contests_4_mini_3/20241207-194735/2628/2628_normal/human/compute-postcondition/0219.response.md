The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as no further execution occurs after this command. The output state reflects the current values of `n`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2`, and notes that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 2`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `a` at index `j`; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
