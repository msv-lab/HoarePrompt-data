The execution of the code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged, as the program's flow is interrupted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]; -1 is printed and we exit the program.
