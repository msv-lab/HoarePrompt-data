Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`. If the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` equals `x2` or `y2`, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1` and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, unless `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, in which case -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, if `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, and either `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, then `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1` and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, unless `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, in which case -1 is printed and the program exits.***
