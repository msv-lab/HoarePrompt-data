Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `m` is an integer from 1 to 12; `B` is a list where each `B[i][0]` holds the count of valid matches found for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`, and `B[i][1]` holds the last value assigned based on the conditions involving elements of `b` and `a`, or remains 0 if no matching conditions were met for that `i`. The sum of the first elements of `A` from index 0 to `n-1` equals 1, or the sum of the first elements of `B` from index 0 to `m-1` equals 1.***
