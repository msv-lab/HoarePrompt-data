The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. This assignment affects the array `A` at index `i` and specifically sets the second item of that sub-array to the value of `x1`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`; the sets formed by the elements of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal; `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`; the value of `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`; the sets formed by the elements of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal; `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`; `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
