The code prints `-1`, which does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `j`, `x2`, or `y2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 2`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `a` at index `j`; and `-1` is printed.**
