In the given code snippet, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. However, `y1` has not been defined in the initial state or in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value for `B[i][1]`. 

Since `B[1][0]` is increased by 1 but is not directly affected by the assignment of `B[i][1] = y1`, we can conclude that the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the initial values of the variables and acknowledges the assignment that cannot be executed due to the undefined `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`; `B[1][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1` which is undefined.**
