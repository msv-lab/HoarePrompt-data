The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this command. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, and the output is -1.
