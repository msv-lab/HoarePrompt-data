The code executes a print statement which outputs the value -1. The variables `n`, `j`, and `a` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2, `a` is not defined and the output -1 is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2, `a` is not defined; -1 is printed.**
