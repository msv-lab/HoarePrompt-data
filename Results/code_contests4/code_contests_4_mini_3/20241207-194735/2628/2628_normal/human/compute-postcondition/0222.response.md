Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 2`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `a` at index `j`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
