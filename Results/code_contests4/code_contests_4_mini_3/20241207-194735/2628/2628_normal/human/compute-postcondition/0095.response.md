The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1`, but it does not affect the values of any variables. The initial values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, and no variables are modified or returned.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, and output is -1.**
