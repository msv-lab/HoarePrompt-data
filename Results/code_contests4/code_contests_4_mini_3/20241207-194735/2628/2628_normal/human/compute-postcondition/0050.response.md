The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program exits before any further execution can take place. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are now assigned values from `b[2] and -1 is printed, and the program exits.
