The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. Therefore, no changes are made to the values of `n`, `j`, `x2`, or `y2`. The output state reflects that the program has been exited without changing any variable states. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 1`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`; `-1` is printed and the program is exited.**
