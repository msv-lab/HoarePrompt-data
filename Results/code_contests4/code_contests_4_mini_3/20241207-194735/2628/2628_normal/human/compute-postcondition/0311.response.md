Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, and the set of elements in `b[2]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[0]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[2][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[2][1]` is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`. If `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 is returned and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is neither equal to `x2` nor `y2`, no actions are executed.***
