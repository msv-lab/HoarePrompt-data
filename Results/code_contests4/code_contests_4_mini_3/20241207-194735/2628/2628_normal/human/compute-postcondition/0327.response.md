Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are the values from `a` at index `j`, which is 1. If the set of `b[i]` is different from the set of `a[j]`, then if `x1` equals either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value from `x1`. Additionally, if `y1` equals either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the sets are equal, no changes occur.***
