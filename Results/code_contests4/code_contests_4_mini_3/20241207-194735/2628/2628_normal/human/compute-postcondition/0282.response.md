The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `y1`, and since `B[i][1]` is being modified, we note that `B[1][0]` was previously increased by 1 but the impact of that on `B[i][1]` is unclear without knowing the value of `y1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment without specifying the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]`; `B[1][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
