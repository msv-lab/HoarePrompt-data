Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, and the set of elements in `b[2]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[0]`. Additionally, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, and either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. The value of `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or `B[i][1]` is equal to `y1`; `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1.**
