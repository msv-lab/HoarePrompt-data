The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Given that `y1` is either equal to `x2` or `y2`, `B[i][1]` will be equal to one of those two values. The values of `n`, `i`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` is assigned the value of `b[i]`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` is assigned the value of `b[i]`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
