The code assigns the values of `b[i]` to `x1` and `y1`. Since `b[i]` is not specified in the initial state, we know that `x1` and `y1` will take on the values corresponding to the specific `i` index of `b`. The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 0 to n-1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 0 to n-1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[2]**
