The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is 1. The previous value of `B[1][0]` is unknown, but it will now be increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]`; `B[1][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]`; `B[1][0]` is increased by 1.**
