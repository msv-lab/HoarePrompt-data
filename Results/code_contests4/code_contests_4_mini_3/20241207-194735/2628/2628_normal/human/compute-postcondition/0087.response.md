Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are unequal, and if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `x1`, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, while the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` remain unequal. If `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is returned and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, ensuring that the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` continue to remain unequal throughout.***
