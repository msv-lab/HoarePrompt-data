The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is `j_current + 1`, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`. However, the specific values of `x1`, `i`, and `B[i][0]` are not provided.

Since the assignment of `B[i][1]` depends on the value of `x1`, and there are no changes to `n`, `j`, `x2`, or `y2`, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
