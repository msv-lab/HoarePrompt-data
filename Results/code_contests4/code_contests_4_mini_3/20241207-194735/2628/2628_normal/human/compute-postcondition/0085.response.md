Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` is assigned the value from `a[1]`, `y1` is assigned the value from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than 0, and the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, then `-1` is returned and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, resulting in either `y1` being equal to `x2` or `y1` being equal to `y2`.***
