The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program execution stops. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2; `a` is not defined; -1 is printed, and the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is 2; `a` is not defined; -1 is printed, and the program exits.**
