Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`. If the sets formed by the elements of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, `A[i][1]` is set to `x1` if it is 0 or equal to `x1`, and `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, -1 is printed and the program exits. If `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor to `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, then `A[i][1]` is set to `y1` if it is 0 or equal to `y1`, and `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, -1 is printed and the program exits. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, no changes to the state occur. If the sets are equal, no changes occur.***
