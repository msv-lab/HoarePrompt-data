According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j_current + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it equal to `j_current + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j_current + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `j` is `j_current + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `j_current + 1**
