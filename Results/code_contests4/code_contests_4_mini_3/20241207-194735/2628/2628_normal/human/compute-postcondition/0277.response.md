The code assigns the value of `x1` to `B[i][1]`. The variable `i` is 1, so this assignment affects the second row of the array `B`. The initial values of `x2` and `y2` are from `a[2]`, but `x1` is not specified in the initial state, so we do not know its value. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `B[i][1]` after this assignment. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1` (unknown).**
