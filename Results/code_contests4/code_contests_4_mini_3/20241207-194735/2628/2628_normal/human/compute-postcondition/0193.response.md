The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the execution of the program immediately. This means that no changes are made to the variables, and the program ends without returning any values or affecting the current state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`; -1 is printed.**
