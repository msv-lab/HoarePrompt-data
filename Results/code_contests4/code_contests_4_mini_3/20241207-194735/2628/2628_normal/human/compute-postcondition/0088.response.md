According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. Since `j` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. The for loop will increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration, making `j` equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2**
