The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `B[i][0]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value, but we know it has increased by 1. The other variables `n`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`, and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`, and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
