The code assigns the values from the list `a` at index `j` to the variables `x2` and `y2`. Given that `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` will take the values of `a[0]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, and `j` remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]**.
