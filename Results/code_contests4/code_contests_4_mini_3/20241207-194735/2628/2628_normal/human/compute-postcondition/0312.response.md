Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`. If the set of elements in `b[2]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[0]`, the program checks the conditions involving `x1`, `y1`, and `B[2][1]` to either increment `B[i][0]`, assign values to `B[i][1]`, or print -1 and exit. If actions are executed based on these conditions, they will affect the state of `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]`. If no conditions are met, no actions are executed. If the sets are equal, no actions are performed.***
