According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an integer from 1 to 12. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
