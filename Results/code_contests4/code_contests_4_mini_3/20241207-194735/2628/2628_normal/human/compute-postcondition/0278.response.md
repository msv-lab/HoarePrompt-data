Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 has been printed and the program has exited. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
