The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, and the program exits without returning any values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]` and -1 is printed, and the program exits.
