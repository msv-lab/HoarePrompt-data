The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `b[j]`, where `j` is currently 1. This means that `x2` and `y2` will take on the values of `b[1]`. The variables `n`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged as a result of this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]**
