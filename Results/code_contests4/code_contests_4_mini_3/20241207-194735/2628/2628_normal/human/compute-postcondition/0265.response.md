The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program stops execution at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2` is assigned the value from `a[1]`; `y2` is -1, and the program exits without further processing. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2` is assigned the value from `a[1]`; `y2` is -1, and the program exits.**
