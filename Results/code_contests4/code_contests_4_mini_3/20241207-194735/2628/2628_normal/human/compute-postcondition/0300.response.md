Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of elements in `b[2]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[0]`, and `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`. If `B[2][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[2][1]` is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`.***
