The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs `-1` to the console. The values of `n`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged and unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 1`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12; `j` is `j_current + 1`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.**
