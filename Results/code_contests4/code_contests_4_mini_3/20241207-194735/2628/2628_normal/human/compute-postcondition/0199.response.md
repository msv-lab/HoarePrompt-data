Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits without returning a value. Otherwise, if `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`, then `B[i][1]` is set to `x1`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `B[i][1]` is equal to `y1`, the program continues without printing -1. The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[0]`, and the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`. Additionally, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`.***
