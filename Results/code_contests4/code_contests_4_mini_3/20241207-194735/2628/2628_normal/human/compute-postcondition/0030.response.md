Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`; the sets formed by the elements of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, no changes to the state occur.***
