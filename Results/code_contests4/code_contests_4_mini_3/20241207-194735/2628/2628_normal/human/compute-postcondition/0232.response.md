According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is an integer from 1 to 12. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be incremented by 1. 

So, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
