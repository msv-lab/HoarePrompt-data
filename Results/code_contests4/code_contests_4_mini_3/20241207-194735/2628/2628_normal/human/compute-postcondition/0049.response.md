The code prints the value -1, which does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are now assigned values from `b[2] and -1 is printed.**
