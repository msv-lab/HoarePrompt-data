The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, but since `x1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `B[i][1]` is assigned a value from `x1`, which remains undefined.

Other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a` at index `j`, which is 1; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned a value from `x1` (undefined)**.
