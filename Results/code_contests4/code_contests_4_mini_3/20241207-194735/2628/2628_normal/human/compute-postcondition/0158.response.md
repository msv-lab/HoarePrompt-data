Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, if `x1` equals `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[2][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` equals `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` does not equal either `x2` or `y2`, no changes are made to `A`. If the sets are equal, no changes are made.***
