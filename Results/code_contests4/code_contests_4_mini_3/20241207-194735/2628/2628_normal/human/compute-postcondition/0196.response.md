The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Since `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, `B[i][1]` will take on one of those values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is equal to `y1`.**
