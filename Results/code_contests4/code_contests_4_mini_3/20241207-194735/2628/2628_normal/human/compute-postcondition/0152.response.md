The `exit()` command terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and no further operations are performed. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the program has exited without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`, and -1 is printed; the program has exited.**
