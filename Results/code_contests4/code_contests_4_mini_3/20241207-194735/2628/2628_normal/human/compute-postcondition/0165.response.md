Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed, and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[2][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
