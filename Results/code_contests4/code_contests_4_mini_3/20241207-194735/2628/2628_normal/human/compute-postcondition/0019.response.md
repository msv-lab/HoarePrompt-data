Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`; the sets formed by the elements of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal; `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.***
