Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum between its previous value and `count`. The variable `start` remains the original value, `end` is the final value, `count` is the sum of all elements in the updated `b`, `i` is set to `end + 1`, and `b` reflects the flips between `start` and `end`.***
