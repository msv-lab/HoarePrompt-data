Postcondition: ***`maximum_count` is the maximum count of flipped elements in `b`, `start` is the original value + 1, `end` is less than `n`, `count` is the sum of elements in the last updated `b`, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2 if `start` was 1 or more, or `n` must remain at least 1 if `start` was 0.***
