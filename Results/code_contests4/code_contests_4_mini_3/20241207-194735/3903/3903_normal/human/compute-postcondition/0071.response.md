The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means we are modifying the second element of the list `b` (since indexing starts at 0). The initial values of `b` are unknown, but it is a list containing elements of `a`. Therefore, after execution, the specific value of `b[1]` changes to `1 - b[1]`. The values of `n`, `end`, `start`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `end` is 1, `b` is a list with the second element changed to `1 - b[1]`, `start` is 1, `i` is 1**
