The code updates the value of `b[i]` to `1 - b[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means the fourth element of `b` (since indexing starts at 0) will be updated. The specific value of `b[3]` is not provided, but it will be flipped to either `0` or `1` based on its current value.

Other variables (`n`, `end`, `start`) remain unaffected by this assignment operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to the array `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `end` is at least 3, `b` has its fourth element changed to `1 - b[3]`, `start` is 1, `i` is 3**
