According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 0 and `end` is 0, meaning that `i` must be equal to `start` (which is 0) when the loop executes for the first time.

Given that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, the next value of `i` will be 1. However, since `end` is 0, the loop cannot execute again unless `end` is increased.

To allow the loop to execute a second time, `end` must be at least 1. So, the states should be modified as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, and `b[0]` is toggled (changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0)**
