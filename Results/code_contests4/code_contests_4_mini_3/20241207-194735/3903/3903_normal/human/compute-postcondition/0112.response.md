The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The previous value of `b[i]` is not specified, but it will be toggled between 0 and 1. The other variables, `maximum_count`, `end`, and `i`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`, `end` is `k + 1`, `i` is `start + 1`, and `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.

Output State: **`maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`, `end` is `k + 1`, `i` is `start + 1`, and `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
