According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. The loop will execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end + 1`. Given that `end` is 1, for the loop to execute at least once, `start` must be less than or equal to 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, we can assume that `start` can be set to a value that satisfies this condition, such as 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure `start` is 1 and `i` will be 1 in the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `end` is 1, `b` is a list containing the elements of `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `start` is 1, `i` is 1**
