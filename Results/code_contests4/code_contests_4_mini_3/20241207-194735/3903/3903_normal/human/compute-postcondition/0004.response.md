According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer based on user input within the range 1 to 100, it guarantees that `n` is at least 1. This means the loop will execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, `maximum_count` is 0 and `start` is 0, which do not affect the execution of the loop. The loop variable `end` will start at 0 for the first iteration, which is the correct starting point.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range and that `end` is initialized correctly.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
