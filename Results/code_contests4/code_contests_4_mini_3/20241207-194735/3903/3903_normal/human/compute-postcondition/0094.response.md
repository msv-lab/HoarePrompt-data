Postcondition: ***`maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`. `start` is the original value + 1, `end` is at least `start`, `count` is the sum of elements in the last updated `b`, and `b` contains the modified values after flipping elements from index `start` to `end`, provided that `start` is less than or equal to `end`.***
