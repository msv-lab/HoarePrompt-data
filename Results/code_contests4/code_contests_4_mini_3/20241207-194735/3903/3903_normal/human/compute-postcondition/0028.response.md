Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `start` is 0, and `end` is an integer between 0 and 100. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `a` is defined with an appropriate initial value, `i` iterates from `start` to `end`, `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]` for each `i` in that range, `count` is the sum of the updated values in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`. If `end` is less than `n`, `end` will be incremented by 1.***
