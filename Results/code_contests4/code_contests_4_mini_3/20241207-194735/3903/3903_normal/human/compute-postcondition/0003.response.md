According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is based on user input and is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 100, the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `start` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. 

The state of `maximum_count` does not directly impact the execution of the loop itself since its value does not affect the loop's control structure. Therefore, it can remain as it is.

State: **`n` is an integer based on user input within the range 1 to 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
