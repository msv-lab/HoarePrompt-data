According to the code, the loop executes while `end` is within the range of `0` to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is currently within the range since it is iterating from `0` to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` will need to be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `end` is at a value less than `n`, allowing for one more execution. Thus, after the next iteration, `end` will be 1 greater than its current value. 

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `start` is 0, `end` is an integer between 0 and 100, for the loop to execute one more time `end` must be less than `n` and `end` will be incremented to 1.**
