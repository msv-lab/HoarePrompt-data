According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `start` to `end + 1`. The loop will execute again if `i` is still within this range. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `start + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes `start + 2`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than or equal to `end`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `end` must be at least `start + 2`.

State: **`a` is defined with an appropriate initial value, `i` is `start + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `end` must be greater than or equal to `start + 2`**
