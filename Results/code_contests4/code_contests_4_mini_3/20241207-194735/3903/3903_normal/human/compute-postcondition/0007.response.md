According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `start` must be less than or equal to `end`. Given that `start` is 0 and `end` is also 0 at the beginning, the loop will execute exactly once with `i` taking the value of 0. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
