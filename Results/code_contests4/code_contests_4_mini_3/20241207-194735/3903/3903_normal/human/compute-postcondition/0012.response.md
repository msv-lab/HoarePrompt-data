`b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`, which toggles the value of `b[i]`. The previous state of `b[i]` can only be 0 or 1, and it changes to the opposite value. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `b[i]` is toggled (changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
