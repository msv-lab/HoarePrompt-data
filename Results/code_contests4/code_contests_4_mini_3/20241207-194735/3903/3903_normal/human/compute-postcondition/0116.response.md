The variable `count` is assigned the value of `sum(b)`, which calculates the total number of elements in the list `b` that are equal to 1 (since `b` consists of toggled values between 0 and 1). The previous value of `count` is unknown, but `maximum_count` will be updated to the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `count`. The variables `end`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`; `end` is `k + 1`, `i` is `end`, `b` is a list where elements from index `start` to `end` have been toggled between 0 and 1; `count` is the sum of elements in `b`.**
