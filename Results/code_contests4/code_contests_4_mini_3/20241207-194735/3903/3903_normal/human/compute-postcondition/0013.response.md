To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we note the following:

- The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, inclusive. Each iteration toggles the value of `b[i]` (changes it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
- The values of `n`, `maximum_count`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Since `start` is 0 and `end` can vary, we analyze how many times `b[i]` will be toggled based on the final value of `end`.

If `end` is 0, `b[0]` is toggled once.
If `end` is 1, `b[0]` and `b[1]` are toggled.
If `end` is 2, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are toggled.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `b` for indices from `start` to `end` would reflect the toggled states based on the number of times each index was toggled.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is an integer between 0 and 100, and `b[i]` is toggled for all `i` from `start` to `end`.**
