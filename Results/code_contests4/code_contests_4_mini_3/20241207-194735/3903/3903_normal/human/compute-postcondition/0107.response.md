According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the `end` variable is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is currently some value less than `n`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `end` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if the previous value of `end` is `k`, for the loop to execute again, `end` will be `k + 1`, and `maximum_count` will be updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. 

State: **`maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`, `end` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `k + 1`**
