The value of `b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`. The variable `i` is 2, so `b[2]` will be changed to `1 - b[2]`. The previous value of `b[2]` is not specified, but it will be toggled between 0 and 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `end` is at least 2, `b` has its third element changed to `1 - b[2]`, `start` is 1, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `end` is at least 2, `b` has its third element changed to `1 - b[2]`, `start` is 1, `i` is 2**
