According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `start`, and `end`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `start`, `end` is `k + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

To execute one more time, `i` should be `start + 1`, and we need to ensure that this value is still less than or equal to `end` (which is `k + 1`). Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` would be `start + 1`.

State: **`maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`; `end` is `k + 1`; `i` is `start + 1`**
