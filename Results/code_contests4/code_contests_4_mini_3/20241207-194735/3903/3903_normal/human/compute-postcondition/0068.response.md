According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `end` is currently at its last value of 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `end` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, `end` becomes 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `end` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
