Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b` is a list created from `a` with elements at indices from `start` to `end` flipped, `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `count`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the program does not execute any operations related to the list and retains its previous state.***
