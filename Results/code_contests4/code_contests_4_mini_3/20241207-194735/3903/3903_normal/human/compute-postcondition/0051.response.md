The assignment `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` flips the value of `b[i]`. Since `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than or equal to 2, the value of `i` does not satisfy this condition, and the loop does not execute. Therefore, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of flipped elements in `b` over all iterations, `start` is 1, `end` is 2, `count` is the sum of elements in the last updated `b`, `i` is 3 and the loop does not execute.**
