The value of `b[i]` is updated by applying the expression `1 - b[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, which means we are accessing the first element of the list `b`. The previous value of `b[0]` is not provided, but it can either be 0 or 1. As a result, `b[0]` will switch its value: if it was 0, it will become 1, and if it was 1, it will become 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, and `b[0]` is toggled (changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
