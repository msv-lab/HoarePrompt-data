The variable `n` is reassigned the value obtained from `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. Given that `n` is initially an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the new value of `n` will still fall within this range based on user input. The list `a` remains unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer based on user input within the range 1 to 100; `a` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on user input within the range 1 to 100; `a` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements.**
