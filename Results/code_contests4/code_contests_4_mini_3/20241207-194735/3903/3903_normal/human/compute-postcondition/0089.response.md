According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate from `start` to `end`. The loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` has been incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `start + 1`. Given that `end` is at least `start`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, so it becomes `start + 2`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `end` must be at least `start + 2`. 

State: **`maximum_count` is the maximum count of flipped elements in `b`, `start` is the original value + 1, `end` is at least `start + 2`, `count` is the sum of elements in the last updated `b`, `i` is `start + 2`, and `b[i]` is flipped from its previous value (0 to 1 or 1 to 0).**
