Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` containing exactly `n` elements that are either 0 or 1. It calculates the maximum possible count of 1s in the list `b` after flipping a contiguous subarray of `a` (where flipping means changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s) for all possible subarrays. The function prints the maximum count of 1s obtained after all possible flips. However, it does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
