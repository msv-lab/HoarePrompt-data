Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `start` is 0; and `end` is at least `n - 1`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b` is a list copy of `a` with all values from index `start` to `end` flipped, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `count`.***
