Postcondition: ***`maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `end` is set to `k + 1`, `i` is assigned the value of `end`, and the list `b` has its elements toggled between 0 and 1 from index `start` to `end`, with `count` representing the sum of elements in `b`.***
