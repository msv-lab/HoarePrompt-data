According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `i`, `start`, and `end`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is `k + 1`, `i` is `start + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `start + 2`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `i` to be less than or equal to `end`, which is `k + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `start + 2` must be less than or equal to `k + 1`. This implies that `start` must be less than or equal to `k - 1`.

State: **`maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`, `end` is `k + 1`, `i` is `start + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `start` must be less than or equal to `k - 1**
