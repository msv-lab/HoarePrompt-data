Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a critical flaw that prevents it from performing correctly according to the problem description. The main issue lies in the way the input list `a` is handled and how the flipping is applied.

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `map(int, raw_input().split())` to read the list of integers. However, `raw_input()` is not valid in Python 3, where `input()` should be used instead. This would lead to a runtime error when trying to execute the program in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Flipping Logic**: The program attempts to create a copy of the list `a` using `b = list(a)`. However, `a` is created as a map object, which is an iterator in Python 3. Therefore, when `list(a)` is called, it will consume the map object, and on subsequent iterations, `a` will not have any elements left, leading to incorrect behavior.

3. **Range of Indices**: The nested loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` for both `start` and `end`. While it correctly checks that `start <= end`, it does not take into account the initial state of the list `a` when calculating the maximum number of 1s after the flip. 

4. **Output Requirement**: The problem specifies that exactly one move must be made, but the implementation does not ensure that the flipping occurs for at least one element and can lead to cases where no flips are made (e.g., when the entire array consists of 1s).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge case of `n = 1` correctly. If there is only one element and it is 1, flipping it would lead to 0, which is not maximizing the number of 1s after exactly one move.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, it cannot guarantee the correct maximum number of 1s obtainable after exactly one move for all specified input cases.
