The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is 0. If `n` is greater than 0, it computes two sums: `f`, which accumulates the minimum values during even iterations, and `s`, which accumulates during odd iterations, based on progressively doubling values. The function then returns the result of the calculation `f * f + s * (s + 1)`. The loop iterates a maximum of 100 times or until `n` becomes less than or equal to 0, which can lead to early termination.
