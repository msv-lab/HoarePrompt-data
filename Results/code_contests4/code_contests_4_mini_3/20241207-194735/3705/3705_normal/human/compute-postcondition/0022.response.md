The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` remains either 0 or 1; `s` takes the value of either 2 or 3 depending on `n`; `p` is 2; `n` is now `n - 2`; and `i` is 100, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
