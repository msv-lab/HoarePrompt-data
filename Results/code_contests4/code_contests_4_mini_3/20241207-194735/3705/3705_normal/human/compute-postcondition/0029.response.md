`n` is decremented by `p`, which is 4. The previous value of `n` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `n` will be `1 - 4 = -3`. The other variables (`l`, `r`, `i`, `f`, `s`, and `p`) are unaffected by this operation. 

Since `n` is now negative, we note this change in the output state. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 100; `f` is either 0 or 1; `p` is 4; `n` is -3; `s` is either 2 or 4 depending on the initial value of `s.**
