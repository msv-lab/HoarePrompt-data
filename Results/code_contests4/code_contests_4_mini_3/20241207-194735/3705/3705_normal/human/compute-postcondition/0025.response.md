According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 100. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 100. Since `i` is not less than 100, the loop cannot execute again. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, but since it is already at the upper limit, the loop cannot proceed. 

Thus, we need to reflect the fact that the loop cannot execute again at this point. No adjustments can be made for the next iteration since the loop has reached its limit.

State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` remains either 0 or 1; `s` takes the value of either 2 or 3 depending on `n`; `p` is 4; `n` is now `n - 2`; `i` is 100, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than 100.**
