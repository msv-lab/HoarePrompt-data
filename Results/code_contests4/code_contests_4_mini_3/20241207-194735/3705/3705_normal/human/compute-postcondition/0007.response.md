Postcondition: ***`l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18, `f` is 0, `s` is 0, `p` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (since `n` is not equal to 0), `i` is an integer that is odd (i.e., `i % 2` is true) for the loop to execute the first time.***
