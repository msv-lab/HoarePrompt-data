To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the behavior of the loop step by step. 

The loop runs for a maximum of 100 iterations, with the loop variable `i` taking values from 0 to 99. The key operations within the loop are:

1. Depending on whether `i` is even or odd, either `f` or `s` is incremented by the minimum of `p` and `n`.
2. After that, `n` is decremented by `p`, and `p` is doubled for the next iteration.
3. The loop breaks if `n` becomes less than or equal to 0.

Given that `p` starts at 1 and doubles each iteration, the values of `p` will be: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ..., up to 2^6 = 64 for the first 7 iterations, and will be 128 for the 8th iteration. 

To summarize the behavior:
- In each iteration, `n` is reduced by `p`.
- If `n` becomes 0 or negative, the loop breaks.
- The total number of iterations will depend on the initial value of `n` and how quickly it gets reduced by the values of `p`.

If `n` starts as a positive integer that is sufficiently large, the loop will run through all iterations until `n` is exhausted. 

Let's analyze the maximum number of iterations:
- The loop will run until `n` is exhausted by the sums of powers of 2:
  - After 1st iteration: `n` - 1
  - After 2nd iteration: `n` - 3
  - After 3rd iteration: `n` - 7
  - After 4th iteration: `n` - 15
  - After 5th iteration: `n` - 31
  - After 6th iteration: `n` - 63
  - After 7th iteration: `n` - 127
  - After 8th iteration: `n` - 255
  - ...
  
The total subtracted values from `n` after 7 iterations will be 127. If `n` starts from a value greater than 127, the loop will complete all 100 iterations but will break early, as soon as `n` is reduced to 0 or negative.

Assuming `n` is sufficiently large, by the end of 100 iterations:
- `f` would count the minimums added during even iterations.
- `s` would count the minimums added during odd iterations.
- `n` would be less than or equal to 0, causing the loop to break.
- `p` would be 2^100 at the end, which is extremely large.

Therefore, after the loop executes fully (or breaks early), we can conclude:

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` is the sum of the minimums added during even iterations, `s` is the sum of the minimums added during odd iterations; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `p` is 2^100.**
