The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 100; `f` is either 0 or 1; `p` is 4; `n` is -3; `s` is either 2 or 4 depending on the initial value of `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
