Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` remains either 0 or 1; `s` takes the value of either 2 or 3 depending on `n`; `p` is 2; `n` is now `n - 2`; and `i` is 100. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
