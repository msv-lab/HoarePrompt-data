Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; if `i` is odd, `f` remains either 0 or 1; `p` is 4; `n` is now `n - 2`; `i` is 100; `s` is either 2 or 4 depending on the initial value of `s`. Otherwise, `f` is either 1 or 2; `s` takes the value of either 2 or 3 depending on `n`; `p` is 4; `n` is now 1; `i` is 100.***
