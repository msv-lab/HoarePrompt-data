The variable `p` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0; `s` is 0; `p` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0; `s` is 0; `p` is 1**
