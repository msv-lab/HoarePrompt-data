The value of `p` is multiplied by 2, and since `p` is currently 2, after execution, `p` will be 4. The values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `f`, `s`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` remains either 0 or 1; `s` takes the value of either 2 or 3 depending on `n`; `p` is 4; `n` is now `n - 2`; and `i` is 100.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` remains either 0 or 1; `s` takes the value of either 2 or 3 depending on `n`; `p` is 4; `n` is now `n - 2`; and `i` is 100.**
