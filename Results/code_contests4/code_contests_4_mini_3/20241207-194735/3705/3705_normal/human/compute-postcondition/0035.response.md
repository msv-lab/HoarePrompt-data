The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, if a certain condition is met, the function returns 0. If that condition is not met, the function returns a value calculated from `f` squared plus `s` multiplied by `(s + 1)`, where `f` is the sum of the minimums added during even iterations and `s` is the sum of the minimums added during odd iterations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 0 or a calculated value based on the sums of minimums from even and odd iterations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns 0 under certain conditions; otherwise, it returns a calculated value based on the sums of minimums from even and odd iterations.**
