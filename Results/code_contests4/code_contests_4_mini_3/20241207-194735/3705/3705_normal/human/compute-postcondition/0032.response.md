The value of `p` is multiplied by 2. The previous value of `p` is 4, so after execution, `p` becomes 8. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 100; `f` is either 0 or 1; `p` is 8; `n` is -3; `s` is either 2 or 4 depending on the initial value of `s`.
