The variable `f` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0.

Output State: **`l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0**
