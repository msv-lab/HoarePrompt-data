Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; if `i` is odd, then `f` remains either 0 or 1; `s` takes the value of either 2 or 3 depending on `n`; `p` is now 2; `n` is now `n - 1`; and `i` is 100 for the loop to execute a next time. If `i` is even, then `f` is updated to `f + min(2, n)`, `s` is 1 if `i` is odd and 0 if `i` is even; `p` is still 2; `n` is now `n - 1`; and `i` is 100 for the loop to execute a next time.***
