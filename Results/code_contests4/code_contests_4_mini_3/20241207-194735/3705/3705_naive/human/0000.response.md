To analyze the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code:

The problem requires us to sum numbers written on a blackboard in a specific pattern based on odd and even sets. The odd set contains numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, ... and the even set contains numbers like 2, 4, 6, 8, ... The numbers are written in stages where the number of integers written doubles with each stage and alternates between the odd and even sets.

The program attempts to calculate the sum of these numbers from index `l` to `r`, with the final result needing to be modulo `1000000007`.

Now, let's analyze the program:

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function calculates some value based on `n` and has a loop that runs a maximum of 100 iterations. It attempts to alternate between summing values from odd and even sets. 

2. **Logic inside the loop**: The function uses `p` which doubles each time (1, 2, 4, 8, ...), but it does not correctly track which numbers from the odd or even sets are being added. The way it calculates the contributions to the sums (`f` and `s`) does not correctly reflect the actual numbers written on the blackboard.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The algorithm only considers up to 100 iterations, which means it will not reach numbers beyond a certain index effectively. Given that `l` and `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), this is a significant limitation.
   - The summation logic (i.e., `f * f + s * (s + 1)`) does not align with the problem's requirement to sum the specific numbers directly from the constructed sequence.

To illustrate a case where the program fails:
- For `l = 1` and `r = 100`, the program should return the sum of the first 100 numbers written down, but the logic will not compute this accurately due to the limitations discussed.

Based on the analysis above, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
