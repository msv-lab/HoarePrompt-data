The `reverse()` method is called on the list `lst`, which reverses the order of the elements in the list. The integers `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9; `lst` is the reversed version of the sorted list of strings obtained from user input.
