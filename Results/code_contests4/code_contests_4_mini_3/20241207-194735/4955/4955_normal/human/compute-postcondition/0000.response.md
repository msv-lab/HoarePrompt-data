The code assigns the variable `lst` the result of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input from the user as a string, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9, the values of `lst` will depend on the user's input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9; `lst` is a list of strings obtained from user input.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9; `lst` is a list of strings obtained from user input.**
