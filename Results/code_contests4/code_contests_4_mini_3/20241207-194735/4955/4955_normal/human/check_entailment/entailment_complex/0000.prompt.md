You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have decided to give an allowance to your child depending on the outcome of the game that he will play now.

The game is played as follows:

* There are three "integer panels", each with a digit between 1 and 9 (inclusive) printed on it, and one "operator panel" with a `+` printed on it.
* The player should construct a formula of the form X + Y, by arranging the four panels from left to right. (The operator panel should not be placed at either end of the formula.)
* Then, the amount of the allowance will be equal to the resulting value of the formula.



Given the values A, B and C printed on the integer panels used in the game, find the maximum possible amount of the allowance.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq A, B, C \leq 9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


A B C


Output

Print the maximum possible amount of the allowance.

Examples

Input

Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9.
def func():
    lst = raw_input().split()
    lst.sort()
    lst.reverse()
    lst = list(map(int, lst))
    ans = 10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input containing three integers A, B, and C (each between 1 and 9), sorts them in descending order, and calculates the result as 10 times the largest integer plus the two smaller integers. It then prints the result. The function does not handle invalid inputs or cases where fewer or more than three integers are provided.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
