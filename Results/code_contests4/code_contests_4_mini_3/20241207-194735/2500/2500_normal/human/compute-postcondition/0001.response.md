The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `i` and `j`. Both `i` and `j` are integers that represent the indices of two distinct pieces of meat. The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]) of these two pieces of meat. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer indices `i` and `j`, and return the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of the two distinct pieces of meat corresponding to those indices.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters i and j, and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of the pieces of meat at indices i and j.**
