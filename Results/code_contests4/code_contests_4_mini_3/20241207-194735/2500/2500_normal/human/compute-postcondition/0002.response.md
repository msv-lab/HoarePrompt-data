Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of the pieces of meat at indices `i` and `j` in the lists `X` and `Y`. The function assumes that `i` and `j` are valid indices for the lists and that the coordinates correspond to distinct pieces of meat. **
