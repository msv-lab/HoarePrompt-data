Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1(i, j)` calculates the Euclidean distance between two pieces of meat based on their coordinates in the lists `X` and `Y`. However, this function alone does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a way to find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready when a heat source is placed optimally.

The problem description specifies that the time taken for the i-th piece of meat to be ready is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{time}_i = c_i \times \sqrt{(X - x_i)^2 + (Y - y_i)^2} \]

The goal is to determine the minimal time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready, which involves more than just calculating distances; it requires evaluating the timing for all pieces of meat based on a chosen (X, Y) position of the heat source and then finding the optimal (X, Y) that minimizes the required time for at least K pieces.

Since the provided function only computes distances and does not consider the hardness `c_i` or the selection of K pieces, it does not meet the problem's requirements. There is no implementation provided that addresses the selection of pieces and the optimization problem as described.

Thus, the program does not do what the problem description asks for every potential case.
