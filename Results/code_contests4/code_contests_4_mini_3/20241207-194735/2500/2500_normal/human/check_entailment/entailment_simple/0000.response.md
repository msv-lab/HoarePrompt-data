Correctness: **False**

The provided program snippet only defines a function `func_1(i, j)` that computes the Euclidean distance between two pieces of meat given their coordinates. However, this is insufficient for solving the problem as described. 

Here are the reasons why it does not meet the problem description:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**: The problem requires finding the optimal position (X, Y) for the heat source to minimize the time required for at least K pieces of meat to be ready. The provided function does not address this optimization problem at all.

2. **Lack of Input Handling**: The program snippet does not demonstrate how it handles the input data or how it processes the list of pieces of meat. The problem involves reading multiple pieces of data and performing calculations based on them, which is not represented in the given code.

3. **Missing Output**: The problem requires returning the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready, but the provided function does not return any output related to this requirement.

In summary, the function only calculates a distance and does not contribute to solving the overall problem of minimizing grilling time based on the positions and hardness of the meat pieces. Hence, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
