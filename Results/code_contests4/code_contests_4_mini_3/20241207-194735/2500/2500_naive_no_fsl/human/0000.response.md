Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are a couple of potential issues and test cases that demonstrate its incorrectness:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program uses a binary search to minimize the time, but it does not ensure that the function it is checking (whether K pieces of meat can be grilled in time `t`) is correctly implemented. Specifically, there might be cases where the calculated position of the heat source does not actually yield the required K pieces of meat within the time `t`.

2. **Precision Issues**: The program attempts to compare distances with a small epsilon value (`1e-09`), but given the constraints of the problem, this might not be sufficient to guarantee the required precision for K pieces of meat to be grilled in the time calculated. 

3. **Potential Case**: Consider an input where all pieces of meat have very high hardness values, such that the calculated optimal position for the heat source does not yield K pieces of meat grilled within the time calculated. This could lead the program to incorrectly conclude that it can grill K pieces when it cannot.

For example:

Input:
```
3 2
0 0 100
1 1 100
2 2 1
```

In this case, the time required should be calculated differently. The program may not find the optimal placement of the heat source effectively, leading to a wrong output.

Thus, the program fails to account for all scenarios and edge cases, leading to its incorrectness.
