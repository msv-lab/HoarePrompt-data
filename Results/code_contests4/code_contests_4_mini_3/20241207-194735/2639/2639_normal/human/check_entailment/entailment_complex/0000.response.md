Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case. While it implements the insertion and finding operations, there are major issues related to the `print` operations that are required by the problem statement.

1. **Print Functionality**: The program must print the keys of the binary search tree using both inorder and preorder traversals when the `print` operation is called. However, there is no mechanism in the code that collects or formats the output appropriately for both traversals. The annotations describe the functions `func_3` and `func_4` as traversals, but they do not indicate how these functions are integrated into the overall program flow, specifically how their outputs are accumulated or printed.

2. **Output Formatting**: The problem description specifies that the output for `print` operations should include a space before each key. The functions do not seem to ensure this formatting requirement is met, as indicated by the lack of handling for leading spaces in the print statements.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The provided functions do not handle edge cases such as printing when the tree is empty or when there are no nodes to display. This could lead to incorrect behavior if a `print` operation is invoked on an empty tree, as it would not return any output or indicate that the tree is empty.

Given the above points, particularly the failure to meet the output requirements for the `print` operation and the lack of integration of the traversal functions with appropriate output handling, the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case. 

Thus, the final conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
