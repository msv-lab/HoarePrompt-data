You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Write a program which performs the following operations to a binary search tree $T$ by adding the find operation to A: Binary Search Tree I.

* insert  $k$: Insert a node containing $k$ as key into $T$.
* find $k$: Report whether $T$ has a node containing $k$.
* print: Print the keys of the binary search tree by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk respectively.

Constraints

* The number of operations $\leq 500,000$
* The number of print operations $\leq 10$.
* $-2,000,000,000 \leq key \leq 2,000,000,000$
* The height of the binary tree does not exceed 100 if you employ the above pseudo code.
* The keys in the binary search tree are all different.

Input

In the first line, the number of operations $m$ is given. In the following $m$ lines, operations represented by insert $k$, find $k$ or print are given.

Output

For each find $k$ operation, print "yes" if $T$ has a node containing $k$, "no" if not.

In addition, for each print operation, print a list of keys obtained by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk in a line respectively. Put a space character before each key.

Example

Input

10
insert 30
insert 88
insert 12
insert 1
insert 20
find 12
insert 17
insert 25
find 16
print


Output

yes
no
 1 12 17 20 25 30 88
 30 12 1 20 17 25 88
Function definition:
```
def func_4(node):
```
