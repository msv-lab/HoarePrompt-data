The function accepts a node representing the root of a binary search tree and performs a preorder traversal, printing the keys of the nodes in the order they are visited. It does not perform any insertions or searches; it only prints the keys of the current node, its left child (if present), and then its right child (if present). The function assumes that the input node is not None. If the input node is None, the function will raise an error as there is no handling for that case.
