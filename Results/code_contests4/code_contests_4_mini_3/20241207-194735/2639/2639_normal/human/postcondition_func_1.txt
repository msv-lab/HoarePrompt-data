The function accepts a binary search tree node and an integer key. It returns False if the node is None, True if the key is found in the tree, or continues the search recursively in the left or right subtree based on whether the key is less than or greater than the current node's key. If the key is not found after exploring all relevant nodes, it will eventually return False.
