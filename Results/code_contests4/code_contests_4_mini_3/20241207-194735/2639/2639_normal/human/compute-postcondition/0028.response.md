Postcondition: ***`y` is the last node visited in the binary search tree traversal based on the key of `z`; `x` is None; `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree; `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`; `y` is not None; if the key of `z` is less than the key of `y`, then `y.left` is now `z`; otherwise, `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.***
