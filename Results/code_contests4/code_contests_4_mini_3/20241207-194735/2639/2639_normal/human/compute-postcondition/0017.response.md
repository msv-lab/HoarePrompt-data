In the initial state, `top`, `y`, and `x` are the root nodes of a binary search tree. The statement `y = x` means that `y` is assigned the reference of `x`, making `y` point to the same node as `x`. After that, the line `x = x.right` updates `x` to point to its right child node.

The impact of the code is that `y` still points to the original node that `x` was pointing to before the assignment. However, after executing `x = x.right`, `x` now points to its right child, which may or may not exist.

Thus, the output state reflects that `y` is pointing to the original node, while `x` is now updated to point to its right child. The states of `top` and `y` are not affected by the change to `x`.

Output State: **`top` is the root node of the binary search tree, `y` points to the original node that `x` was pointing to, `x` now points to `x.right` (the right child of the original node).**
