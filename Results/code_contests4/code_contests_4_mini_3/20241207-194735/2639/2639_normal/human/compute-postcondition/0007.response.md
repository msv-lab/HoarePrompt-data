The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` is the root node of a binary search tree that contains unique integer keys. The function performs various operations on the binary search tree, including inserting keys, finding keys, and printing the tree in inorder and preorder traversals. The operations are constrained to not exceed 500,000, and the keys being inserted or found are within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to manage and manipulate a binary search tree represented by the `node` parameter through various operations while adhering to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node, which is the root of a binary search tree, and performs operations such as inserting keys, finding keys, and printing the tree in inorder and preorder traversals, all while adhering to specific constraints on the number of operations and the range of key values.**
