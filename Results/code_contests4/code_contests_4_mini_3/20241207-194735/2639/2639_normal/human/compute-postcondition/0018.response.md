Postcondition: ***`top`, `y`, and `x` are the root nodes of a binary search tree. If `z.key` is less than `x.key`, then `x` now points to `x.left` and `y` retains the previous value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` points to the original node that `x` was pointing to, and `x` now points to `x.right` (the right child of the original node).***
