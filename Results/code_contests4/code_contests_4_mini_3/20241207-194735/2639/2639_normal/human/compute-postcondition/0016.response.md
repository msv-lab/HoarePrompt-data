In this scenario, `y` is assigned the value of `x`, which means `y` now points to the same Node instance as `x`. The code `x = x.left` reassigns `x` to its left child Node, effectively changing what `x` references. The variable `y` remains unchanged in its reference to the previous `x`, but `x` now points to `x.left`.

Therefore, the output state is: `top` is the root node of the binary search tree, `y` is the previous value of `x`, and `x` now points to its left child.

Output State: **`top` is the root node of the binary search tree, `y` is the previous value of `x`, `x` now points to `x.left`**
