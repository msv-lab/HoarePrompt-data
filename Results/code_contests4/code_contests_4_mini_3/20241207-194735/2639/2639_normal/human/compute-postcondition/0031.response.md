The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `top` and `z`. `top` is the root node of a binary search tree, while `z` is a list of strings containing operations in the format of either "insert k", "find k", or "print". The integer `k` in these operations is constrained to the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000, and the total number of operations in `z` is less than or equal to 500,000. After executing the function body, it returns the root node of the binary search tree, which is assigned to `top`, without altering the state of `y` or `z`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary search tree root node `top` and a list of operations `z`, and return the root node of the binary search tree. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary search tree root node `top` and a list of operations `z`, and returns the root node of the binary search tree.**
