The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `node`, which is the root of a binary search tree containing unique integer keys, and `key`, which is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. 

After executing the function body, the function performs the following checks:
- If `node` is None, the function returns `False`, indicating that the key is not present in the binary search tree.
- If the key is found in the current `node`, the function returns `True`.
- If the key is less than the current node's key, the function recursively calls itself with the left child of the current node.
- If the key is greater than the current node's key, the function recursively calls itself with the right child of the current node.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a binary search tree root node and an integer key, and to return whether the key is present in the binary search tree. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node (the root of a binary search tree) and a parameter key (an integer). It returns False if the node is not present, True if the key is found, or continues the search recursively in the left or right subtree based on the comparison with the current node's key.**
