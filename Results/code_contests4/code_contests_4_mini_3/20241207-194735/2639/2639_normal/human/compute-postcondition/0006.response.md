Postcondition: ***`node` is the root node of a binary search tree; the key of the node is printed. If `node` has a right child, the function `func_4` is called with `node.right` as the argument. If `node` has a left child, the function `func_4` is called with `node.left` as the argument; otherwise, only the key of the node is printed.***
