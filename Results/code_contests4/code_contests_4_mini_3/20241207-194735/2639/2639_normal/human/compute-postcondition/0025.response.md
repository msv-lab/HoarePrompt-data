The variable `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`. Since `y` is not None, this assignment establishes `z` as the left child of `y` in the binary search tree. The previous states of other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the changes.

Output State: **`y` is the last node visited in the binary search tree traversal based on the key of `z`; `x` is None; `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree; `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`; `y` is not None; the key of `z` is less than the key of `y`; `y.left` is now `z`.**
