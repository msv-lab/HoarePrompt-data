Postcondition: ***`y` is the last node visited in the binary search tree traversal based on the key of `z`; `x` is None indicating the point where the search ends; `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree; `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`; `y` is not None; and `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`.***
