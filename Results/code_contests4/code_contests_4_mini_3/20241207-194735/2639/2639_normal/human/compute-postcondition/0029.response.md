Postcondition: ***`y` is the last node visited in the binary search tree traversal based on the key of `z`, `x` is None, and `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree. If `y` is None, then `top` is assigned the value of `z`, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` is None. If `y` is not None, then `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, and if the key of `z` is less than the key of `y`, then `y.left` is now `z`; otherwise, `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.***
