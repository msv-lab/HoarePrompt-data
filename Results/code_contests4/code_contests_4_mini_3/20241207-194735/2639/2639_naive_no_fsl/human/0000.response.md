Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the situation where the binary search tree (BST) is empty when trying to print the keys. Specifically, if the `print` operation is called on an empty tree, the program will output nothing but still proceed to call the preorder traversal function, which will also output nothing. This behavior does not conform to the problem description, which specifies that for each print operation, the keys obtained by inorder and preorder tree walks should be printed.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:
1. If the input contains only a `print` operation and no `insert` operations, the output will not include any keys, which does not align with the requirement to print the keys of the binary search tree.

For example:
Input:
```
1
print
```
Expected Output:
```
 
```
Actual Output:
```
```

Since the program is expected to print keys even if the tree is empty, the output should not be blank, and thus it does not meet the problem requirements correctly.
