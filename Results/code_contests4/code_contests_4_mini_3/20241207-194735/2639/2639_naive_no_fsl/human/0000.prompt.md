You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a program which performs the following operations to a binary search tree $T$ by adding the find operation to A: Binary Search Tree I.

* insert  $k$: Insert a node containing $k$ as key into $T$.
* find $k$: Report whether $T$ has a node containing $k$.
* print: Print the keys of the binary search tree by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk respectively.

Constraints

* The number of operations $\leq 500,000$
* The number of print operations $\leq 10$.
* $-2,000,000,000 \leq key \leq 2,000,000,000$
* The height of the binary tree does not exceed 100 if you employ the above pseudo code.
* The keys in the binary search tree are all different.

Input

In the first line, the number of operations $m$ is given. In the following $m$ lines, operations represented by insert $k$, find $k$ or print are given.

Output

For each find $k$ operation, print "yes" if $T$ has a node containing $k$, "no" if not.

In addition, for each print operation, print a list of keys obtained by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk in a line respectively. Put a space character before each key.

Example

Input

10
insert 30
insert 88
insert 12
insert 1
insert 20
find 12
insert 17
insert 25
find 16
print


Output

yes
no
 1 12 17 20 25 30 88
 30 12 1 20 17 25 88
Program:
```
class Node(object):

    def __init__(self, key=None):
        self.key = key
        self.parent = None
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def func_1(top, z):
    y = None
    x = top
    while isinstance(x, Node):
        y = x
        if z.key < x.key:
            x = x.left
        else:
            x = x.right
    z.parent = y
    if y is None:
        top = z
    elif z.key < y.key:
        y.left = z
    else:
        y.right = z
    return top

def func_2(node, key):
    if not node:
        return False
    if node.key == key:
        return True
    if key < node.key:
        return func_2(node.left, key)
    return func_2(node.right, key)

def func_3(node):
    if node.left:
        func_3(node.left)
    print('', node.key, end='')
    if node.right:
        func_3(node.right)

def func_4(node):
    print('', node.key, end='')
    if node.left:
        func_4(node.left)
    if node.right:
        func_4(node.right)
n = int(stdin.readline())
top = None
for _ in range(n):
    cmd = stdin.readline()
    if cmd.startswith('i'):
        key = int(cmd[7:])
        top = func_1(top, Node(key))
    elif cmd.startswith('f'):
        key = int(cmd[5:])
        r = func_2(top, key)
        print('yes' if r else 'no')
    else:
        func_3(top)
        print()
        func_4(top)
        print()
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
