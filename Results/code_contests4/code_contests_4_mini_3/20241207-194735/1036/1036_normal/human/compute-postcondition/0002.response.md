According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 1. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 2, which means that `n` is definitely not equal to 1. Therefore, the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments needed to the current state.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `count` is equal to `n`**
