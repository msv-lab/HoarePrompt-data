According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 4**
