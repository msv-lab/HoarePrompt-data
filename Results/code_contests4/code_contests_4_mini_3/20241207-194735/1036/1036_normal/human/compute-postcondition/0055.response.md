Postcondition: ***`n` is decreased by `b`, `i` is either a prime number greater than or equal to 2 that is less than `n`, or `i` is equal to `n` if no divisor is found before reaching `n`; `count` is increased by `b`, and if `b` is equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
