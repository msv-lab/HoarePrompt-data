According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 3**
