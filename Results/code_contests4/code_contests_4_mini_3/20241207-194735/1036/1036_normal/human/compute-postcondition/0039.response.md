According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 2 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 2. Since the current state indicates that `n` is greater than 1 but does not guarantee that `n` is greater than 2, this needs to be adjusted. 

Additionally, `i` will start at 2 for the first iteration. Thus, to ensure the loop executes, the conditions must be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the first time**
