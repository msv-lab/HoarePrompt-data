According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n` and `n` is not divisible by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 3 and not divisible by the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3 and not divisible by 4, `i` is 4**
