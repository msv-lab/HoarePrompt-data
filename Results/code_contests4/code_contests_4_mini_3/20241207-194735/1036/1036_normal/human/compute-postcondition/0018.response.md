The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 decreased by `b` (where `b` is 1); `count` is `n + b` after the modification of `n`; `b` is equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
