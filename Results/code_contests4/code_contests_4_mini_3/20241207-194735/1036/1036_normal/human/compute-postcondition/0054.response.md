The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is decreased by `b`; `i` is either a prime number greater than or equal to 2 that is less than `n`, or `i` is equal to `n` if no divisor is found before reaching `n`; `count` is increased by `b`; and `b` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
