The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 3, the loop would not execute a second time as `n` must be greater than 3 for that to happen. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3 and we break out of the loop.  
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3 and we break out of the loop.**
