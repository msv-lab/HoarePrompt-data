The variable `count` is assigned the value of `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The value of `n` is determined by user input, but since it's stated that `n` is already an integer greater than or equal to 2, `count` will have the same value as `n`. Since the output does not change the value of `n`, the output state reflects that `count` has been assigned the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `count` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `count` is equal to `n`**
