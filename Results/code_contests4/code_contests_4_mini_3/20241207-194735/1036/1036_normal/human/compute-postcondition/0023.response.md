The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `b` is adjusted accordingly, `i` is 2, and the remainder of the division of `n` by `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
