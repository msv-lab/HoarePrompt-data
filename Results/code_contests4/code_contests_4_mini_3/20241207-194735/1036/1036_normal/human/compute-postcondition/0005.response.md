The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `count` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, and `n` is divisible by `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
