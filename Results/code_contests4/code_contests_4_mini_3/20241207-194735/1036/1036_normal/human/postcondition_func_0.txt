The function accepts an integer `n` greater than or equal to 2, continuously divides `n` by the smallest integer that divides `n` evenly, and accumulates the results in `count`. The process continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point it prints the total count, which includes the initial value of `n` and all computed divisions.
