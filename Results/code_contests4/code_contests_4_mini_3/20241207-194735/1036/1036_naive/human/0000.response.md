To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The task is to maximize the sum of a sequence of integers formed by the number of pebbles after each arrangement, where the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble. The initial number of pebbles is `n`, and the Beaver arranges them into rows with the condition that he must use all pebbles.

### Code Analysis:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
count = n
while n != 1:
    for i in range(2, n):
        if divmod(n, i)[1] == 0:
            break
    b = n // i
    count += b
    n -= b
    if b == 1:
        break
print(count)
```

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` and initializing `count` with `n`.
2. **Loop until one pebble is left**: The main loop continues until `n` becomes 1.
3. **Finding a divisor**: The inner loop searches for the smallest integer `i` (starting from 2) that divides `n` without a remainder. This means the Beaver can arrange `n` pebbles into `i` rows.
4. **Calculating `b`**: After finding `i`, `b` is calculated as `n // i`. This is the number of pebbles per row.
5. **Updating count and `n`**: The program adds `b` to `count` and then updates `n` to `n - b`.
6. **Breaking condition**: If `b` equals 1, the loop breaks.

### Potential Issues:
- The code does not handle the case where `n` might not have a divisor other than itself (if `n` is prime). For a prime number, after the first iteration, it will find `i = n` and then `b = 1`, which leads to an immediate termination of the game. This means if `n` is prime, the result may not represent the maximum possible sum because the program will only add `n` and then 1 in the next step.
  
### Testing with an Input Case:
- Consider `n = 5` (a prime number). The program will execute as follows:
    - `count = 5`
    - In the loop, it searches for divisors and finds `i = 5` (the only option), hence `b = 1`.
    - `count` becomes `5 + 1 = 6`, and `n` is updated to `5 - 1 = 4`.
    - On the next iteration, it would search for divisors of `4`, and it will find `i = 2`, leading to `b = 2`, and continue.
  
However, the correct maximal value for the game with `5` should be `6` (from the first move) but the program will not reach the maximum possible sequence for all cases, particularly for composites and primes.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the maximal path for prime numbers as it prematurely breaks out of the sequence without considering all arrangements. 

Correctness: **False**.
