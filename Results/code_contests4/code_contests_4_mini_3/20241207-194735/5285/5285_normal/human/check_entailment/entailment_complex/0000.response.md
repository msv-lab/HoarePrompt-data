Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of trailing zeros in the base `b` representation of `n!` as required by the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Trailing Zeros**: The program attempts to factorize `b` and then compute some values based on these factors. However, the actual number of trailing zeros in the base `b` representation of `n!` is determined by how many times `n!` can be divided by `b`, taking into account its prime factorization. The correct way involves counting how many times each prime factor of `b` divides `n!`, and then using these counts to compute the minimum number of times `b` can divide `n!`.

2. **Logic Errors in Factor Counting**: The nested loops and logic used to calculate `izv` and `mlt` are not aligned with the standard method for calculating trailing zeros in factorials for a given base. The program does not correctly implement the mathematical principles needed to derive the count of trailing zeros.

3. **Output Logic**: The variable `res` is initialized to `-1` and updated based on the values of `mlt`. If there are no prime factors for `b`, the program can end up returning a negative value or an uninitialized state, which does not conform to the expected output of a non-negative integer representing the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Complexity and Edge Cases**: The program's handling of large values for `n` and `b` (up to `10^18` and `10^12`, respectively) is not guaranteed to be efficient or correct due to the potential for overflow and the way it iterates through factors. The check `while True and i < 10:` is particularly problematic, as it limits iterations arbitrarily and can lead to incomplete calculations.

In summary, the program does not adhere to the requirements of the problem description for calculating trailing zeros in the factorial of `n` in base `b`, and therefore it is incorrect.
