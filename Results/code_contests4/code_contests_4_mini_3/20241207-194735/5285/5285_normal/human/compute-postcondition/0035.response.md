Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. If `cur` is 3, then `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` is divisible by 2, and for the loop to execute again, `b` must be greater than 1. Otherwise, if `cur` is either 5 or 6, then `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` is divisible by 2, and for the loop to execute again, `b` must be greater than 1.***
