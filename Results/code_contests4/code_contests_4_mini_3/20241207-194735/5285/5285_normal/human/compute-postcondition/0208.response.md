The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. Since the initial state indicates that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `newnewk` will have the same value as `newk`. The values of `st`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
