According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `st`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `st` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. After the first iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so now `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
