The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
