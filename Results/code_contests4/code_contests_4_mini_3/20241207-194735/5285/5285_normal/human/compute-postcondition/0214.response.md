The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown, and therefore we cannot specify its new value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed; `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed; `st` is increased by 1.**
