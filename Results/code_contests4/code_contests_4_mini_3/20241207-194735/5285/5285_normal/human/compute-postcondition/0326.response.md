The code assigns the value `0` to `newizv`, which does not affect the other variables. The previous states of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0**
