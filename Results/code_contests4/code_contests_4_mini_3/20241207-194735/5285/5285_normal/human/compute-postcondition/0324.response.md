The variable `st` is assigned the value 0. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, and `st` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, and `st` is 0**.
