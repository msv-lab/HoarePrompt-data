According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2. However, since `st` is 1, the loop cannot execute again because `i` will no longer be less than `st`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
