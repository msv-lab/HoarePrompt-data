`st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, variable `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, variable `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared.**
