According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `st`. For the loop to execute at least once, `st` must be greater than 0. Currently, `st` is 0, which means the loop will not execute at all. 

So, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust `st` to be at least 1, while the other states can remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 1 (for the loop to execute the first time), `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is 1 (the final value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`)**
