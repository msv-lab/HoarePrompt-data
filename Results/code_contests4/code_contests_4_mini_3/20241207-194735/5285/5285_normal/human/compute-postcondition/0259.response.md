According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1**
