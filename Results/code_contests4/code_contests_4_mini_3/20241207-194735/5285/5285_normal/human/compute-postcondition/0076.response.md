The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. Given that `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1`, the new value of `izv` will be `izv + newizv`. Since `izv` is initially 0, the new value of `izv` will be equal to `newizv`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`izv` is `newizv`, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is `st + 1`, `st` is as defined, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`.**
