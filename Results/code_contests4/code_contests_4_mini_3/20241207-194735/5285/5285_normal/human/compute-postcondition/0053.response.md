The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The assignment does not affect any other variables since `newizv` is a new variable. Therefore, the values of `izv`, `res`, `d_osn`, `k`, `newk`, `newn`, `i`, and `st` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n` which is undefined, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0**
