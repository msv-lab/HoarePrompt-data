The execution of the code snippet `continue` does not change any variable values; it simply skips the current iteration of a loop. The values of `n`, `b`, `cur`, `s`, and `d_osn` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and notes that we have continued to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer halved if it was divisible by `cur`; `cur` is updated to 3 or 4; `s` remains 0; `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` was divisible by 2; `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`; `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1; `b` is now divided by `cur`; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
