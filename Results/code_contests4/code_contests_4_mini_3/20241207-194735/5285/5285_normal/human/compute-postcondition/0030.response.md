The value of `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` can be either 3 or 4, and the impact on `d_osn` depends on that value. The state of `n`, `b`, and the condition for the loop are not affected by this operation directly. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment in `d_osn`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is either 3 or 4; `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
