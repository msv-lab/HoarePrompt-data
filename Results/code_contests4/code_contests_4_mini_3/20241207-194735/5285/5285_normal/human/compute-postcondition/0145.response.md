To determine the conditions under which the loop can execute for the first time, we need to analyze the provided information and the loop condition:

1. The loop condition is `newn > newk ** st`, which means that for the loop to execute, `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
2. We know that `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `st`.
3. The expression `newk ** st` can be evaluated based on the values given. Since `st` is greater than 0, `newk ** st` will be a positive number, specifically `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

Given that `newn` is greater than `newk`, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:

- `newn > newk ** st` holds true.

Since we don't have the specific values of `newn` and `newk`, we have to ensure that `newn` remains greater than `newk ** st`. 

If `newn` is not sufficiently larger than `newk ** st`, we would need to adjust `newn` to make sure the inequality holds. Therefore, we can say:

- If `newn` is not currently greater than `newk ** st`, then we should adjust `newn` to be at least equal to `newk ** st + 1`.

Thus, the adjustment needed is only to `newn` to ensure it is greater than `newk ** st`.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` which is equal to `2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` needs to be greater than `newk ** st`**.
