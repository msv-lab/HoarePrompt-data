In order for the `while` loop to execute, the condition `newnewk <= newn` must be satisfied. 

Let's analyze the current state:

- `newnewk` is equal to `k`, which is the first element in `d_osn`.
- `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, which is currently undefined.

For the loop to execute at least once, `newnewk` (which is equal to `k`) must be less than or equal to `newn`. Since `newn` is undefined, it cannot be compared to `newnewk` at this point.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to define `n` such that `newn` becomes a value that is greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore:

1. `n` must be defined and must be greater than or equal to `k` for the loop condition to hold true.

Thus, `newn` needs to be set to a value (let's say `k` or greater) to ensure the loop condition can be satisfied.

State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `k`, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be defined and `newn` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
