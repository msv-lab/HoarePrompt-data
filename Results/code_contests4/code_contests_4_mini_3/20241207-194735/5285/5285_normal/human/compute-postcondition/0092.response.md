The value of `st` is incremented by 1, so `st` changes from 0 to 1. The other variables (`i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.**
