The value of `newnewk` is assigned the value `newnewk * newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk` squared, the previous value of `newnewk` is known. The loop condition states that `newn` is greater than `newk` and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must also be greater than `newk * newk^2`. The execution of the code does not change `newn` or `newk`, but it updates `newnewk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is updated based on its previous value and `newk`, `newn` is greater than `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * newk^2`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is updated based on its previous value and `newk`; `newn` is greater than `newk`; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * newk^2`**.
