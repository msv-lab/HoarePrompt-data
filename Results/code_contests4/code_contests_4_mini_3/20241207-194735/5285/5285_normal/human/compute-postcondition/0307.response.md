The variable `newizv` is being updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `newizv`, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The other variables, `i` and `st`, are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state indicates that `newizv` is being modified but its new value remains undefined due to the lack of a starting value.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, and `newizv` is updated but remains undefined.**
