The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 0, so the calculation becomes `0 * 2 + 1`, which results in `newizv` being updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1**
