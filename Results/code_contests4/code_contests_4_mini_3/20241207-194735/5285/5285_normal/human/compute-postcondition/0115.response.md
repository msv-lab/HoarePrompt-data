The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Given that `st` is 1, the operation simplifies to `newn = newn - newk`. The previous values of `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`, and `izv` are not directly affected, but since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we can conclude that the new value of `newn` will be less than `newnewk` after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to be `newn - newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to be `newn - newk`**.
