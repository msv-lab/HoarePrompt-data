According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute a third time, `st` must be greater than 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, it will become 3.

State: **`i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 3**
