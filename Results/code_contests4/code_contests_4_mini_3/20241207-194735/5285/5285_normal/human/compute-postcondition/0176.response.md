In the given code, `st` is incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `izv`, `newk`, `newn`, `newizv`, `newnewk`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newk`.**
