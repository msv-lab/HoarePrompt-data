According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. For the loop to execute at least once, `st` must be greater than 0. Currently, `st` is equal to 0, which means the loop would not execute. Additionally, `i` would start at 0 if the loop could execute. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted so that `st` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0**
