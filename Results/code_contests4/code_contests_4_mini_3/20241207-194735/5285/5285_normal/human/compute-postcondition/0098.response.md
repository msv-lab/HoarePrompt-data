`st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk` remain unaffected as there are no operations involving them in the provided code. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0.

Output State: **`st` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0**
