`st` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 2, after execution, `st` becomes 3. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk * newk`, `st` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk * newk`, `st` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`**
