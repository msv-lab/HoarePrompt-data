The loop continues to execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Each iteration of the loop multiplies `newnewk` by `newk` and increments `st` by 1. 

After the loop finishes executing, the conditions will be such that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and `st` will represent the count of iterations made. Given that the starting value of `newnewk` is `newk` and it is multiplied by `newk` on each iteration, `newnewk` will eventually exceed `newn`. 

Since `newn` is initially less than or equal to `newk`, the loop will execute multiple times until `newnewk` surpasses `newn`. Therefore, `st` will reflect the total number of times the loop ran. 

At the end of the loop, `i` will have been incremented the same number of times as `st`, and `newizv` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is incremented by `st`, `newizv` is 0.**
