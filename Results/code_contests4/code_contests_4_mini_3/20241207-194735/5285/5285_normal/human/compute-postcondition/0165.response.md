The variable `izv` is initialized to 0. This does not depend on the values of `i` or `k`. The previous values of `i` and `k` are not affected by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `izv` while leaving the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0**
