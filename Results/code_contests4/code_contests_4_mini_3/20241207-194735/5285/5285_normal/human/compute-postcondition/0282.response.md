Postcondition: ***`i` is 10, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is updated based on the iterations, `newk` remains unchanged. If `res` is equal to -1, then `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`. Otherwise, if `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`.***
