According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. For the loop to execute, `newnewk` must also be less than or equal to `newn`. 

Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newnewk`, which is equal to `newk`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `newn` must be at least equal to `newk`.

State: **`st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk`**
