`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 3, the calculation is as follows: `newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`. The values of the other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `newizv` is 7.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `newizv` is 7**
