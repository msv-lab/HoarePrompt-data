Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer that may have been halved if it was divisible by `cur`. If `cur` was 2, it is updated to 3; otherwise, it is updated to 4. `s` remains 0, and `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` was divisible by 2. Additionally, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
