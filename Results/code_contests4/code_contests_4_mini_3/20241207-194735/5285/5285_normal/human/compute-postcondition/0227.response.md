The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

`newizv` = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.

The values of the other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `newizv` is 7, `i` is 2**.
