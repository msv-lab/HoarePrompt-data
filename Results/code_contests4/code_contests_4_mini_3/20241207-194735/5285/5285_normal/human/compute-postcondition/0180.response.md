To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop. The loop condition is `newnewk <= newn`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, which is the current value of `k`.
- `newn` is assigned the value of `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must still be less than or equal to `newn`. 

Given that:
- `i` is 1,
- `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, 
- `izv` is 0, 
- `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, 
- `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, 
- `st` is 2, 
- `newizv` is 0, 
- `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, 

We need to ensure that the value of `newnewk` (which is now `newk` multiplied by its previous value) remains less than or equal to `newn`. 

Since `newnewk` is obtained by multiplying `newk` (which is equal to `k`) by its previous value, we need to ensure that `newk` is such that the result of multiplying does not exceed `newn`. 

Thus, we can conclude:
- Since `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, the product could potentially exceed `newn`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that the multiplication does not result in a value greater than `newn`.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn` after the multiplication**.
