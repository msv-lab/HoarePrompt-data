According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. For the loop to execute, `st` needs to be greater than 0. Given that `st` is 1 before entering the loop, the loop will execute once. At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is incremented by 1 from its initial state, if `i` started at 0, it will be 1 after the first iteration. 

So, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `st` is greater than 0, and since `i` starts from its initial state (which we assume is 0), it will be 0 before the first iteration. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
