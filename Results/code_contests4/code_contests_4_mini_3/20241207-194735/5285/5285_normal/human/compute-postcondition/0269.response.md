The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newn` must also be less than `newk`, and raising `newk` to the power of `st` will result in a value that is larger than `newn`. Therefore, after the operation, `newn` decreases and its new value will be less than the previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated.**
