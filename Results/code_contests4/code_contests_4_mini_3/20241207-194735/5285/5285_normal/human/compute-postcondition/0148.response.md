To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition: `newn > newk ** st`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- We know that `newn` is greater than `newk`, and `st` is greater than 0.
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), which means that `newk ** st` will be less than `newk ** (st + 1)`.
- Since `newn` is greater than `newk`, it provides a baseline that might allow for the condition to hold.

However, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the current value of `newn` is indeed greater than `newk ** st`. Since `newn` was decreased by `newk`, we need to adjust it to ensure that the loop can proceed.

Thus, we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk ** st`. This can be satisfied by adjusting `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st` after decrementing by `newk`.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, which is equal to `2^st - 1; newn is adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st`**
