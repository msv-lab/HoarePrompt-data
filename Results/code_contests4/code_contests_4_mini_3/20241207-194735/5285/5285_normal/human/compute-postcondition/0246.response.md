The value of `st` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk * newk`**
