According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will continue executing as long as `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following states:
- `i` is `st - 1`
- `st` is the total number of iterations
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`
- `newn` is decreased by `newk`

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`. Since `newn` has been decreased by `newk`, we can express this as:
- If `newn` was previously greater than `newk * st`, after the last iteration it needs to remain greater than `newk * st`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. 

State: **`i` is `st - 1`, `st` is the total number of iterations, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * st`**
