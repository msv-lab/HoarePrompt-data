The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `n`. However, the value of `n` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since we don't have any information about `n`, we cannot determine its value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, and `newn` is assigned the value of `n` which is undefined.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n` which is undefined.**
