The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown. The other variable `newnewk` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is increased by 1**
