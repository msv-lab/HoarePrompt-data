`d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1. Since `cur` is 2, the value of `d_osn[2]` will increase by 1. The other variables `n`, `b`, `s`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn[2]` is 1; `cur` is 2; `b` is divisible by `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn[2]` is 1; `cur` is 2; `b` is divisible by `cur`.**
