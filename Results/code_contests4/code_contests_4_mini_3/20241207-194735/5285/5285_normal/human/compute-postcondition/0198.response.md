The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is not specified, so we can only indicate that it has been increased. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `st`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`.
