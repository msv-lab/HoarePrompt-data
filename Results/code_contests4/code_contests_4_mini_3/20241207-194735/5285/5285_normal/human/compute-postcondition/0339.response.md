The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is at least 1 greater than its initial value (but less than 10), and `newizv` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
