According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `b` is a positive integer in the range 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12, which means `b` is at least 2. Therefore, `b` is already greater than 1, and the loop can execute.

Since `b` satisfies the condition to allow the loop to execute one time, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict(int); `cur` is 2**
