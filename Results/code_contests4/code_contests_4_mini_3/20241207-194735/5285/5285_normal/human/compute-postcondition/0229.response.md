According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 

Given that `newnewk` is defined as the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, it implies that `newk ** st` is less than or equal to `newnewk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`. However, since `newnewk` is already greater than `newn`, this indicates that `newk ** st` must also be less than `newn` for the first iteration to proceed.

To summarize, the current state indicates that `newn` is not greater than `newk ** st`. To allow the loop to execute at least one time, we can adjust the state of `newn` to be greater than `newnewk`, which means `newn` must be larger than `newk ** st`.

State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is equal to `st`, for the loop to execute the first time then `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`**
