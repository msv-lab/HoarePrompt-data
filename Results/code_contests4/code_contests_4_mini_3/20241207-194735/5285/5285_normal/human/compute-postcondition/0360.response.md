The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` must be less than 10, but the exact value is not specified, so we know that `i` will now be at least 1 and at most 10. The values of `newn` and `newk` remain unchanged, and `st` is still 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0**
