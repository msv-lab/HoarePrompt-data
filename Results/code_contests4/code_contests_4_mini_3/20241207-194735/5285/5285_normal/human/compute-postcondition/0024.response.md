Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer that may have been halved if it was divisible by `cur`, and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 1; `cur` is updated to 3 or 4; `s` remains 0; `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` was divisible by 2; `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`; `cur` is increased by 2.**
