According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newk`, and `newn` is equal to `n`. 

Since `newnewk` is `newk * newk`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `newnewk` to be less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `newk * newk` is less than or equal to `n`. 

We do not have specific values for `newk` or `n`, but we can state that for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `newk * newk` is less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newk * newk` is less than or equal to `n`**
