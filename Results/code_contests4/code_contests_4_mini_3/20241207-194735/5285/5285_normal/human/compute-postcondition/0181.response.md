The variable `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. The value of `newk` is currently assigned the value of `k`, which is the next element in `d_osn`. Since the initial value of `newnewk` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific new value. However, the new value of `newnewk` is now `newnewk * k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now `newnewk * k`.**
