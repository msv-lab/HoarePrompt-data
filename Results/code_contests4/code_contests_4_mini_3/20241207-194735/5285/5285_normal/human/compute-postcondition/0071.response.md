The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The initial value of `newizv` is 1. Therefore, `newizv` is calculated as `1 * 2 + 1`, which equals `3`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 1, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
