The value of `newnewk` is updated to be equal to `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` was equal to `newk` squared before this operation, after execution, `newnewk` becomes `newk` squared multiplied by `newk`, which is `newk` cubed. The state of `newn` remains unaffected, but it is still greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed.**
