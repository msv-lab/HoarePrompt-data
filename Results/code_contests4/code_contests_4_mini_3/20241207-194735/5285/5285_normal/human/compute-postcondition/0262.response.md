`newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3, so the calculation becomes `3 * 2 + 1`, which results in `7`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 7.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 7**
