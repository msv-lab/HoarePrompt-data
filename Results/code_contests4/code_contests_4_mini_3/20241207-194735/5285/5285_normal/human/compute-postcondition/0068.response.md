According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute if `st` is at least 1. Currently, `st` is 0, which means the loop will not execute at all. 

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `st` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`izv`, `res`, `d_osn`, `k`, `newk`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, and `newn`) do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but we need to adjust `st`.

State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `st` is 1 for the loop to execute, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop.**
