The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn[2]` is 1; `cur` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
