The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown and must be less than 10. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1**
