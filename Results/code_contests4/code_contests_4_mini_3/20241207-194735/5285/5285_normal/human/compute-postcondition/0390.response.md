The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, but the previous value of `izv` is unknown. The values of `newn` and `newk` are not affected by this operation, but it's important to note that for the loop to execute again, `newn` must still be greater than `newk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
