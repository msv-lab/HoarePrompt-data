`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, which is equal to `2^st - 1`. The previous value of `izv` is not specified, so it is unclear what the new value of `izv` will be after this operation. The other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, `newk`, `newn`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is equal to `st`, and `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
