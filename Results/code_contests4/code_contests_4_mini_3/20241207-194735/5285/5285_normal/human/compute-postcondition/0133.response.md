The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is not specified. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newk`, and `newn`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is updated based on its previous value and `newk`; `newn` is greater than `newk`; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * newk^2`; and `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is updated based on its previous value and `newk`; `newn` is greater than `newk`; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * newk^2`; `st` is increased by 1.**
