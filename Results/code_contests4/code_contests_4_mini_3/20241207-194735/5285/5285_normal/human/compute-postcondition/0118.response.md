The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Since `st` is 1, this simplifies to `newn = newn - newk`. The values of `newnewk`, `i`, and `izv` are not directly affected by this operation, but `newn` is modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk`.**
