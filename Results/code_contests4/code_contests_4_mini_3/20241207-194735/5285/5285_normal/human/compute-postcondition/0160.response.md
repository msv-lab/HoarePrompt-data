Postcondition: ***`i` is 10, `izv` is the total accumulation based on the calculations performed during the iterations, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is not equal to -1, and `mlt` is less than `res`.***
