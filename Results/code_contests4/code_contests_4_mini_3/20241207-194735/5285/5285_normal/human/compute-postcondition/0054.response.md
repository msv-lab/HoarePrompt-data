`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and since `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` will have the same value as `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n` which is undefined, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `k`.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n` which is undefined, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `k`**.
