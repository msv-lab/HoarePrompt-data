The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
