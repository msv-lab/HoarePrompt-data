According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` has been multiplied by `newk`, and `st` has been increased by 1. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to confirm that `newnewk` is still less than or equal to `newn`. If `newnewk` was equal to `newn` before the multiplication, then after multiplying by `newk`, `newnewk` would exceed `newn`, and the loop would not execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than the value of `newnewk` after it has been multiplied by `newk`.

State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than the new value of `newnewk`.**
