According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` and `newnewk` must still be less than or equal to `newn` for the loop to run again. 

Since `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk`, we need to ensure that `newnewk` is still within the limit set by `newn`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than the value of `newnewk` after the multiplication. 

State: **`st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
