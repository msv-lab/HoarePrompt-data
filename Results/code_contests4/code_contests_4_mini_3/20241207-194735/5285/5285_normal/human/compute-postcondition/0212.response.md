To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `newnewk <= newn`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` (since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared).
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, which implies that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `newnewk <= newn` must still hold true. Since `newnewk` is currently equal to `newk` squared, it must be ensured that `newnewk` does not exceed `newn`.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute again, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newnewk` after the last iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk + 1` (to ensure the condition still holds true).

State: **`newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newnewk`, which is equal to `newk` squared, so `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1**.
