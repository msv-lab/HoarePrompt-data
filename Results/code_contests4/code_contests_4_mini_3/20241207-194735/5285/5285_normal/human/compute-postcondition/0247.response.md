According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk * newk` and `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must still be less than or equal to `newn` after the next iteration. Since `i` is increased by 1 and `newnewk` is calculated as `newk * newk`, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than or equal to the next value of `newnewk`. 

If `newnewk` is already equal to `newn`, we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than `newnewk` to allow the loop to execute again. Therefore, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk * newk`.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk * newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk * newk`**
