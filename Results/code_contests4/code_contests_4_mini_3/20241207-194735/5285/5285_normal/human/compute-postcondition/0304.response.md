The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, and `st` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
