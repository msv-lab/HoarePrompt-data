`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, but the values of `newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.  
Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.**
