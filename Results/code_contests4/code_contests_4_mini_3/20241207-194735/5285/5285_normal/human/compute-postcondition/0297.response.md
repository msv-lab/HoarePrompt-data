The code `newnewk *= newk` attempts to multiply the current value of `newnewk` by `newk`. However, we do not have the initial value of `newnewk` provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine how this operation affects the overall state of the variables.

Since `newnewk` is used in the calculation but its value is unknown, we cannot provide a definitive output state regarding its new value.

Given that the other variables remain unaffected, the Output State will reflect that `newnewk` is being multiplied by `newk`, without specifying a new value for `newnewk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, but the value of `newnewk` is unknown; `i` is 1, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0.**
