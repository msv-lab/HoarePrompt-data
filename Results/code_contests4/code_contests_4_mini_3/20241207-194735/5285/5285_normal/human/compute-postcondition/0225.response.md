`newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 1, so after execution, the new value of `newizv` becomes `1 * 2 + 1`, which is 3. The states of the other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `newizv` is 3, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `newizv` is 3, `i` is 1**
