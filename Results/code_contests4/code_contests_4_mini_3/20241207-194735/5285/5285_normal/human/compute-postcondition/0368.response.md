The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is not provided, but it is affected by the increment operation. The other variables `newn`, `newk`, and `newnewk` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is increased by 1.**
