Postcondition: ***`i` is 10, `izv` is the total accumulation based on the calculations performed during the iterations, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`. If `res` is -1, then `res` is equal to `mlt`. Otherwise, if `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is updated to `mlt`.***
