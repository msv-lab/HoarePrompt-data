According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as the condition `True and i < 10` is satisfied. Since `True` is always true, the loop will execute as long as `i < 10`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which satisfies the condition `i < 10`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n` which is undefined; `i` is 0**
