The variables `n` and `b` are assigned values from the input, where the input consists of two positive integers separated by a space. The constraints specify that `n` must be between 1 and \(10^{18}\), and `b` must be between 2 and \(10^{12}\). Therefore, after running the code, `n` and `b` will hold the values provided by the user through input. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12**
