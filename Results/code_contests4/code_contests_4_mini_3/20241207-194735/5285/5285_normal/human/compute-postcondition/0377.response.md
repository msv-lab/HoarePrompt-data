`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Initially, `newizv` is 0, so the calculation becomes `0 * 2 + 1`, which equals 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 1, and `newnewk` is 1.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is 1**
