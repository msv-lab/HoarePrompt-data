The value of `st` is incremented by 1, so `st` changes from 1 to 2. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk` squared; `newn` is greater than `newk`; `st` is 2; `i` is 2; `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`; `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk` squared; `newn` is greater than `newk`; `st` is 2; `i` is 2; `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`; `newizv` is 0.**
