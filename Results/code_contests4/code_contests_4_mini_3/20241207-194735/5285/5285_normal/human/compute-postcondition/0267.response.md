To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk * st`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is greater than 0
- `i` is `st - 1`
- `newn` is decreased by `newk`

From the condition `newn > newk * st`, we need to ensure this condition holds true for the loop to execute again.

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we can infer that the current value of `newn` is less than `newnewk`. However, we need to ensure that `newn` remains greater than `newk * st`. 

For the loop to execute again, we must ensure that the computation of `newn` after being decreased by `newk` still satisfies the condition. Specifically, we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than `newk * st`. 

Since `newn` was decreased by `newk`, we can express this requirement as:
- Initially, `newn` must have been greater than `newk * st + newk`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time are:
- `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk * st + newk`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is `st - 1`; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * st + newk`**
