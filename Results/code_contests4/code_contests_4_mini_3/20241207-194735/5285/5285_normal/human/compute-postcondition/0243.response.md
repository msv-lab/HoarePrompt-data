The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The previous value of `newk` is unknown, but it remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`.**
