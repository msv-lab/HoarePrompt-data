The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is the final value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, which is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
