The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n` which is undefined, `i` is 1, `st` is 0**
