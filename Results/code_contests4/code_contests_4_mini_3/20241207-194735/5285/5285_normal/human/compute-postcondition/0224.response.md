According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`, which determines how many times the loop will run. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `st`. Since `st` is at least 1, it means the loop can execute at least once more.

After the current iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `newizv` is 1, `i` is 1**
