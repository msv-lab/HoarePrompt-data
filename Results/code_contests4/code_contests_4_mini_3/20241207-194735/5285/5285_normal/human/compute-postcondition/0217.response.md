The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown. Thus, the output state reflects that `st` has increased by 1, while the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`; `st` is increased by 1**
