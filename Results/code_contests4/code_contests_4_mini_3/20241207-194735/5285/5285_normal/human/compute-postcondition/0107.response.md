According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` would need to be incremented to 2, which would mean `st` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2**
