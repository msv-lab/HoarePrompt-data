The value of `i` is reassigned to 0, changing it from its previous value of 10. The values of `k`, `izv`, `newk`, and `newn` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and `newn` is assigned the value of `n`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**.
