Output State: **`i` is 10, `izv` is the total accumulation based on all calculations during iterations, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the maximum power computed, `mlt` is the last calculated value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, and `res` is the minimum of all `mlt` values computed or the last assigned value. The value of `res` is printed.**
