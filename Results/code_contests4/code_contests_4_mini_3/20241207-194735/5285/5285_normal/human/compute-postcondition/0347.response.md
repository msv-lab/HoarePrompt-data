The loop iterates `st` times, and during each iteration, it updates `newizv` by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1. Given the output states after the first three iterations:

- After 1 iteration: `newizv` is 1
- After 2 iterations: `newizv` is 3
- After 3 iterations: `newizv` is 7

We can observe a pattern in how `newizv` is being calculated. Specifically, after each iteration, `newizv` follows the formula:

- After 1 iteration: \( newizv = 2^1 - 1 = 1 \)
- After 2 iterations: \( newizv = 2^2 - 1 = 3 \)
- After 3 iterations: \( newizv = 2^3 - 1 = 7 \)

Thus, after `st` iterations, `newizv` will be \( 2^{st} - 1 \).

If `st` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `newizv` will remain 0.

Therefore, we can conclude:

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`.**
