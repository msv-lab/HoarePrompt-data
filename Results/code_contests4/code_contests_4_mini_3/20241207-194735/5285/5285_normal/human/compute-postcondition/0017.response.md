The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that either `b` is halved if it is divisible by `cur`, or `cur` is updated to 3 if it was 2, or to 4 otherwise; `s` remains 0; `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` was divisible by 2; `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
