The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`k`, `izv`, `newk`, `newn`, `st`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, and `st` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, and `st` is 0**.
