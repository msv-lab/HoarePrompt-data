The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`. Since `newnewk` was assigned the value of `newk` before this operation, we can express this as `newnewk = newk * newk`, which means `newnewk` will now hold the value of `newk` squared. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk` squared.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk` squared.**
