The variable `cur` is assigned the value 2. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict(int); `cur` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict(int); `cur` is 2**
