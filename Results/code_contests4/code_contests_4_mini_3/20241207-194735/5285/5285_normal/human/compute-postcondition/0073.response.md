The value of `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 3, `st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 3, `st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**.
