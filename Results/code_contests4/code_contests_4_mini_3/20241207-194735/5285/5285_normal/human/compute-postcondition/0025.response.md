Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; if `cur` is equal to 2, then `cur` is updated to 3, `s` remains 0, `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` was divisible by 2, and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to 3 or 4, `s` remains 0, `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` was divisible by 2, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and `cur` is increased by 2.***
