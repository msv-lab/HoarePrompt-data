The value of `st` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `st` was 1, but now it is overwritten. Other variables `newnewk`, `newn`, `i`, and `izv` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` for each iteration until the loop condition fails.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` for each iteration until the loop condition fails.**
