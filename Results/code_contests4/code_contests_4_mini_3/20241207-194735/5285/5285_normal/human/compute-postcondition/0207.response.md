The code assigns the value `0` to `newizv`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0**.
