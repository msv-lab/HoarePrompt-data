The value of `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, which is then multiplied by `newk`. This means that `newnewk` is now equal to `newk * newk`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk * newk`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk * newk`.**
