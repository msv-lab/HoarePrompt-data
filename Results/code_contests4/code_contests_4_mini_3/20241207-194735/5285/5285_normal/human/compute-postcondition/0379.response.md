The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 1, so after execution, `newizv` becomes `1 * 2 + 1`, which equals 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is 1, for the loop to execute again `st` must be greater than 10.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is 1, for the loop to execute again `st` must be greater than 10.**
