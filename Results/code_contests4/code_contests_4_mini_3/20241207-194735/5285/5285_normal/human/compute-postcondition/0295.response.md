`st` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `st` is 0, after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk * newk`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk * newk`.**
