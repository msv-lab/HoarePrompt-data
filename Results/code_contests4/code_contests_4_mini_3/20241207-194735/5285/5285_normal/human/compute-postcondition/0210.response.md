The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newnewk * newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, this means the operation will be `newk * newk`. Therefore, `newnewk` will be updated to `newk` squared. The values of `newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, variable `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared.**
