The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, which means `izv` is increased by the amount of `newizv`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `izv` will now hold a new value that is the sum of its previous value and `newizv`. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
