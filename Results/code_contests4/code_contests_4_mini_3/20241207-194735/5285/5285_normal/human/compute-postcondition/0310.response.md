According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 1. After the previous iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newizv` is updated based on its previous value, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2**
