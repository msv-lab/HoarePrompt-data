To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `newn > newk * st`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is equal to `st`
- `k` is the next element in `d_osn`
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`
- `newk` is assigned the value of `k`
- `newn` is decreased by `newk`

We need to check the condition `newn > newk * st`.

1. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has already been decreased by `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that after this decrease, `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`.
2. This means that before the last decrease, `newn` must have been greater than `newk * st + newk` which simplifies to `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`.

Thus, the necessary adjustment for the loop to execute again is that `newn` must be more than `newk * (st + 1)`.

State: **`i` is equal to `st`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`**
