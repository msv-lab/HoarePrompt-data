The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `b`. `n` is a positive integer constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `b` is a positive integer constrained such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12. The function does not specify its output in the provided information. As a result, we do not have sufficient details to describe the return value or the specific functionality based on the given constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 10^18) and `b` (a positive integer between 2 and 10^12). The output is not specified.**
