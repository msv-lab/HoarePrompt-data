According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, but we do not know the value of `newnewk`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `newnewk` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `newn`. Since `newn` is equal to `n` and `newk` is equal to `k`, and we know that `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, this means that `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newk`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`, `i` is 1, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0**
