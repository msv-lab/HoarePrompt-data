According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is currently less than or equal to `newk ** st` because `newk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st`. 

Since `newk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, we can infer that `newn` should be increased to be at least equal to `newk ** st`. 

State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`**
