The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not specified, but the operation will reduce `newn` by the value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, and `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`.
