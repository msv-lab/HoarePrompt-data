To evaluate the code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the line `newn = newn - newk ** st`.

1. **Variables Involved:**
   - `newnewk` is greater than `newn` (indicating that `newk` is a positive value).
   - `st` is 1.
   - `i` is equal to `st` (which means `i` is also 1).
   - `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, which results in `newizv` being `1` (since `2^1 - 1 = 1`).
   - `izv` is increased by `newizv`, but the specific value of `izv` is not provided in the initial state.

2. **Calculating the Impact of the Code:**
   - The expression `newk ** st` calculates `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since `st` is 1, this simplifies to `newk`.
   - The line `newn = newn - newk` updates `newn` by subtracting `newk` from its previous value.
   - Because `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, the value of `newn` will decrease, but we do not have specific numerical values for `newn` and `newk`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `newn` changes, but without specific values, we can only state that `newn` is decreased by `newk`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `newn` is decreased by `newk`.**
