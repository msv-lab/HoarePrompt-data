Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (between 1 and 10^18) and `b` (between 2 and 10^12), and computes the minimum value of `izv // d_osn[k]` for all prime factors `k` of `b`. The function prints this minimum value as the result. If `b` is not divisible by any prime factors less than or equal to its square root, it considers `b` itself as a prime factor if it is greater than 2. The output is the minimum calculated value or potentially an error due to the nature of the calculations if no valid factors are found.**
