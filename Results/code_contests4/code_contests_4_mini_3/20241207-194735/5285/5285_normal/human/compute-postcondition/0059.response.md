To evaluate the provided code snippet, we start by analyzing the initial state of the variables involved:

- `izv` is 0
- `res` is -1
- `d_osn` has at least 1 element
- `k` is the first element in `d_osn`
- `newk` is equal to `k`
- `i` is 1
- `st` is 1
- `newizv` is 0
- `newnewk` is equal to `k` squared

Now, we will focus on the line of code:
```
newnewk *= newk
```

Here, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newk` is equal to `k`, this means:
- `newnewk` will be updated to `newnewk * newk` (which is `k^2 * k`).

Given that `newnewk` was initially `k` squared, the calculation can be simplified:
- `newnewk` after execution will be `k^2 * k` = `k^3`.

Since no other variables are affected, we will summarize the final state of the variables.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `k^3.**
