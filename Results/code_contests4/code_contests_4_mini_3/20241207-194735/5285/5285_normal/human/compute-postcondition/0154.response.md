Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` can no longer be decremented by `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `st` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `st`.**
