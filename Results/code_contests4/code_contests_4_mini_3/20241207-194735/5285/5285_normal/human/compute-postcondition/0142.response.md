According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is 5, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 2**
