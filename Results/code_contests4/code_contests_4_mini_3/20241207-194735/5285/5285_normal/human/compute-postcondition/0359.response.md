The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, and `st` is 0. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, `st` is 0**
