Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`. If `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining all the initial variable relationships.***
