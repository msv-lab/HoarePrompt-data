According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, so the loop can execute if `newnewk` (which is equal to `newk`) is also less than or equal to `newn`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, the current state is already sufficient for the loop to execute once. 

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, variable `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
