The value of `newizv` is updated based on the formula `newizv * 2 + 1`. Initially, `newizv` is 0. Therefore, the calculation becomes `0 * 2 + 1`, which results in `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `st` is 1 for the loop to execute, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
