The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 0, the calculation results in `newizv` being assigned the value `0 * 2 + 1`, which equals 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, with `newizv` now being 1.
