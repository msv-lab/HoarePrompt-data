According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop combined with a condition `i < 10`. The loop will certainly execute again since it is a `while True` loop, regardless of the values of `newn`, `newk`, or `i`. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the state variables for the loop to proceed.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`**
