The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`. The initial state indicates that `newk` is equal to `k`, and `newnewk` is equal to `k^3`. Thus, after the execution of the code, `newnewk` will become `k^3 * k`, which simplifies to `k^4`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `k^4`.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `k^4**
