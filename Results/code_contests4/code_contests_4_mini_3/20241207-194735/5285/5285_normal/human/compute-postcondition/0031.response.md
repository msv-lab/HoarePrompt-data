The value of `b` is divided by `cur`, where `cur` can be either 3 or 4. The exact value of `b` is not specified, but it will be affected by this operation. The values of `n` and `d_osn[cur]` are not directly changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the division of `b` by `cur` without knowing the initial value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is either 3 or 4; `b` is divided by `cur`.**
