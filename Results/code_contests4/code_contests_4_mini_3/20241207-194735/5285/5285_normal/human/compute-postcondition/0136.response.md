The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is equal to 0, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newizv` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
