The variable `newnewk` is multiplied by the value of `newk`. Since `newnewk` was assigned the value of `newk` before this operation, it is effectively squared. The previous values of the affected variables are `newnewk` (which is equal to `newk`) and `newk`. The value of `newnewk` will now be `newk * newk`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk * newk`**
