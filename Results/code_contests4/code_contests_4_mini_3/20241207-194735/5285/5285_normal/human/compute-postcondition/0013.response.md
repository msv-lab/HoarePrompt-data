The value of `cur` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `cur` is 2, so after execution, `cur` will be 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict(int); `cur` is 4; `b` is not divisible by `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict(int); `cur` is 4; `b` is not divisible by `cur`.**
