According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is 1, which is less than or equal to 10. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 10. Since `i` is currently between 1 and 10, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be adjusted to be greater than 10, and `i` must be updated accordingly.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is 2, `st` must be greater than 10.**
