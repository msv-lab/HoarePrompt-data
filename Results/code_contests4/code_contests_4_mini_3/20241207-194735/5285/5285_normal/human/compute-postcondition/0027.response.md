The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `s` remains 0; `cur` is either 3 or 4; `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` was divisible by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
