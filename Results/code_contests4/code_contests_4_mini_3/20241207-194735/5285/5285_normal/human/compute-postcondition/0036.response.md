Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is either 3 or 4; if `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is divided by `cur`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if `cur` is 3, `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` is divisible by 2, and the loop will execute again if `b` is greater than 1. If `cur` is either 5 or 6, then `d_osn[2]` is set to 1 if `b` is divisible by 2, and the loop will execute again if `b` is greater than 1.***
