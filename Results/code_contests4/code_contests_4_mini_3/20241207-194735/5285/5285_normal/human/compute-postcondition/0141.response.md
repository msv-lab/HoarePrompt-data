The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not provided directly, but it is stated that it is increased by `newizv` which is now 2. Thus, we can assume the previous value of `newizv` is 2. Calculating `newizv` gives us:

`newizv = 2 * 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv` which is now 5, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv` which is now 5, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1.**
