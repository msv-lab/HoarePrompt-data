The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Given that `newizv` is initially 0, we calculate the new value as follows:

`newizv = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`

The values of other variables (`i`, `k`, `newk`, `newn`, `st`, `newnewk`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is 1**
