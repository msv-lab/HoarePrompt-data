The code `izv += newizv` indicates that the value of `izv` is increased by `newizv`. In the initial state, we have the following:

- `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1`.
- `izv` is increased by this value of `newizv`.

As `izv` is being updated, we need to consider its previous value, which is not explicitly given, and thus we cannot determine an exact new value for `izv`. However, we can state that `izv` will now hold its previous value plus `newizv`.

The other variables `i`, `st`, and `newk` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

- `i` is `st - 1`
- `st` is the total number of iterations
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`

Output State: **`i` is `st - 1`, `st` is the total number of iterations, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
