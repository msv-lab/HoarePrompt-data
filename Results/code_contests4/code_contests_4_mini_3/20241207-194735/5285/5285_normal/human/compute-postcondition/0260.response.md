`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since the initial value of `newizv` is 1, we calculate `newizv` as follows: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3**
