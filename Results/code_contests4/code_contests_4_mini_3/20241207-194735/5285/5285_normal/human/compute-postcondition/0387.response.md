The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The values of `newn` and `newk` remain unchanged, but since `newn` is decreased by `newk`, it is implied that `newn` is currently greater than `newk` in order for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is decreased by `newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`.
Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
