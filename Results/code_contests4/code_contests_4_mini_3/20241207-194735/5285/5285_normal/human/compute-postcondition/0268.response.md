The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, but the previous value of `izv` is unknown. Other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`**.
