The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk`, `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk`, `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newizv` is 0.**
