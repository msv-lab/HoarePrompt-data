The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since the previous value of `newizv` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact outcome based on the given information. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated but its previous value is unknown.

Output State: **`i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated but its previous value is unknown.**
