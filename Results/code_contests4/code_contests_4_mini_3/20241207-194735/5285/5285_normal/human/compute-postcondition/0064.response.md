The loop multiplies `newnewk` by `newk` each time it executes, incrementing `st` with each multiplication until `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. 

If `newnewk` starts at `k` and the loop continues until `newnewk` becomes greater than `newn`, we can deduce the following:

- After the first iteration, `newnewk` becomes `k^2` and `st` is incremented to 1.
- After the second iteration, `newnewk` becomes `k^3` and `st` is incremented to 2.
- After the third iteration, `newnewk` becomes `k^4` and `st` is incremented to 3.

This pattern continues, and after `s` iterations, `newnewk` becomes `k^(s+1)` and `st` equals `s`. The loop will stop executing once `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. 

Let `s` be the maximum number of iterations the loop can run before the condition fails. Therefore, `newnewk` will be `k^(s+1)` and `st` will equal `s`.

If the loop stops executing, it means `newnewk` is now greater than `newn`, and thus `st` will be final count of the iterations performed.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, and `newnewk` is greater than `newn`.**
