Postcondition: ***`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is equal to 0, `i` is 2, and `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, with `newizv` being 0. If `st` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
