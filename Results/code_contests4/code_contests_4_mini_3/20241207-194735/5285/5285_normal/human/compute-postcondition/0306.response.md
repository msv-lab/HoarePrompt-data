According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute if `st` is greater than 0, since the range function generates a sequence from 0 to `st - 1`. In the current state, `st` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed and is 0. Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, `st` must be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

Additionally, the variable `i` is initialized as 1, but it will be the loop variable that starts at 0 and increments after each iteration. Therefore, `i` will need to be 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`i` is 0, `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
