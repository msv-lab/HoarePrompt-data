According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is 1. Since `i` is not less than `st`, the loop will not execute again. 

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `st`, which means that for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be incremented to 2. 

State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 1, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
