To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is `newn > newk * st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is `st - 1`
- `st` is the total number of iterations
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`
- `newn` is decreased by `newk`

For the loop to execute again, we need the condition `newn > newk * st` to hold true.

Since `newn` has been decreased by `newk`, we can express the adjustment needed for `newn` to satisfy the loop condition:

- If `newn` was previously greater than `newk * st`, for it to still be greater after the decrement, we can say that after the last iteration:
  - `newn - newk > newk * st` 

This rearranges to: 
- `newn > newk * st + newk` 

This implies that for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`.

No other variables need adjustments as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`i` is `st - 1`, `st` is the total number of iterations, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * (st + 1)`**
