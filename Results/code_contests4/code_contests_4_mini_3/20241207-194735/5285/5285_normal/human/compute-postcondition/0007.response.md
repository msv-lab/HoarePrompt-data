The value of `b` is divided by `cur`, which is 2. Since `b` is a positive integer and is divisible by `cur`, the new value of `b` will be `b / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn[2]` is 1; `cur` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn[2]` is 1; `cur` is 2**
