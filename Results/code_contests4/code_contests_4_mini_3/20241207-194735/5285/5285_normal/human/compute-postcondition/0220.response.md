The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed before `newnewk` exceeded `newn`, `newizv` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, and `st` equals 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
