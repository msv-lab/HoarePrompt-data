According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute again as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` multiplied by `st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has decreased by `newk`, and we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk * st` for the loop to execute again. 

To determine if the loop can execute again:
- We know `newn` has already decreased by `newk`, so we need to find a condition that guarantees that `newn > newk * st` still holds true after this decrease. 
- We can express the condition as `newn + newk > newk * st`. 

Since `newk` is equal to `k`, we can state that for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `newn` must be greater than `newk * st` after its decrease.

Thus, we need to adjust `newn` to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`. 

State: **`izv` is `newizv + newizv`, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is `st + 1`, `st` is as defined, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`**
