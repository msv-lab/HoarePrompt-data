The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is not provided, but since `newk` is a variable, we can assume it holds a specific value. The impact of this operation is that `newnewk` will now hold a value that is `newnewk` (previous value) multiplied by `newk`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk * newk`, `st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`**.
