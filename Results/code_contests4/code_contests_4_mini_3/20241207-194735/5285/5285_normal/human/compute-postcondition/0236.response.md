The variable `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The value of `newizv` is defined as `2^st - 1`, and since `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is calculated based on that. The values of `newnewk`, `newk`, and `newn` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
