According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is at least 1. To execute the loop for a second time, `st` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 2. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 1**
