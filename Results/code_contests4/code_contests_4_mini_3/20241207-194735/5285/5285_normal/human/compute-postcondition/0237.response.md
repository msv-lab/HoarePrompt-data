The variable `newn` is decremented by the value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of the affected variables are `newnewk`, `st`, `newizv`, `i`, and `izv`, but they remain unchanged. The new value of `newn` will be the original value minus `newk ** st`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.
