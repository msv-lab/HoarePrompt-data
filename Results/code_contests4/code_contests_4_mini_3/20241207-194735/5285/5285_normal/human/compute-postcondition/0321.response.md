The variable `newn` is decremented by the value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of the affected variables are `newn` (which is not specified), `newk`, and `st` (which is the total number of iterations). The value of `newk ** st` calculates the exponentiation of `newk` to `st`, and `newn` is reduced by this value. Since `newn` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we note that the result will depend on its prior value.

Output State: **`i` is `st - 1`, `st` is the total number of iterations, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.**
