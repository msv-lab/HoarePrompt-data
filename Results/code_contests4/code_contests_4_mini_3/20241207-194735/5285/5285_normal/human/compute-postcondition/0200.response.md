To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while newn > newk * st:
```

For the loop to execute again, the condition `newn > newk * st` must hold true. Let's break down the current state:

- `i` is equal to `st`
- `k` is the next element in `d_osn`
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`
- `newk` is assigned the value of `k`
- `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`
- `newn` is decreased by `newk`

Given that `newn` is currently greater than `newk * (st + 1)`, it implies that `newn` must have been sufficiently large at the end of the previous iteration. However, the decrease in `newn` by `newk` implies that we need to ensure that after this decrease, the condition for the loop still holds.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `newn` after being decreased by `newk` must still be greater than `newk * st`. This can be expressed as:

- Before the decrease: `newn > newk * (st + 1)`
- After the decrease: `newn - newk > newk * st`

This leads us to simplify and express `newn` in relation to `newk` and `st`. We can conclude that we need to ensure:

1. The value of `newn` must be adjusted to ensure that after the decrease by `newk`, it still holds that `newn > newk * st`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to establish that:

- `newn` must be greater than `newk * st + newk`, which is equivalent to `newn` being at least `newk * (st + 1)`.

State: **`i` is equal to `st`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)` and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must also be greater than `newk * st + newk`**
