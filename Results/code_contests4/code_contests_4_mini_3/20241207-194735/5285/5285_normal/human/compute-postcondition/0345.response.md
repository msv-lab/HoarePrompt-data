According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is at least 2, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 2, and `i` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `newizv` is 3**
