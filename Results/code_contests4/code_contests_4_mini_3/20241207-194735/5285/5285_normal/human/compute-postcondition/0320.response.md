The value of `izv` is increased by `newizv`, where `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1`. The previous value of `izv` is not specified, but it will now include this addition. The states of the other variables, `i`, `st`, `newizv`, and `newn` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `st - 1`, `st` is the total number of iterations, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`i` is `st - 1`, `st` is the total number of iterations, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
