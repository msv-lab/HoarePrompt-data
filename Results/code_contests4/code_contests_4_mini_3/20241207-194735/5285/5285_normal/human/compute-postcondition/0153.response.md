The value of `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The variable `newk` raised to the power of `st` has a specific value based on the initial state, and `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk`, so `newn` is reduced by that value. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1); `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`; and `newn` is now decreased by `newk ** st`.
