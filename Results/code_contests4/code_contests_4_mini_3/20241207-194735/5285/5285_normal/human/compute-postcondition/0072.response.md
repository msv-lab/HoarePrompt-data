According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `st`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `st` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3, and for the loop to execute a third time, `st` must be greater than 3.

State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 3, `st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
