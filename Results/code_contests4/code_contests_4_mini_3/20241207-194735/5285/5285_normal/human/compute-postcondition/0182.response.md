`st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 2, so after execution, `st` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now `newnewk * k`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is now `newnewk * k`.**
