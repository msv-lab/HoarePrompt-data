According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
