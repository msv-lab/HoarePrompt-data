To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

The state right before the loop indicates the following:
- `izv` is 0
- `res` is -1
- `d_osn` has at least 1 element
- `k` is the first element in `d_osn`
- `newk` is equal to `k`
- `i` is `st + 1`
- `st` is as defined
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`
- `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`

Now, we need to ensure that the condition `newn > newk ** st` holds true for the loop to execute at least once. Since `newk` is equal to `k`, we can rewrite the condition as `newn > k ** st`.

Currently, we know that `newnewk` (which is `k^(st + 1)`) is greater than `newn`. Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `newn` is indeed greater than `k ** st`.

To achieve this, we can adjust the value of `newn`. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we can set `newn` to a value that is less than `k ** st`, ensuring the condition `newn > k ** st` is met.

In summary, to allow the loop to execute at least once, we can state that `newn` should be adjusted to be less than `k ** st`.

State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is `st + 1`, `st` is as defined, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` should be adjusted to be greater than `k ** st`**
