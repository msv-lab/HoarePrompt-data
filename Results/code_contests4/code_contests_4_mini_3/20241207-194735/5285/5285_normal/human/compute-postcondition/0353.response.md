The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value. Since `st` is equal to `i`, and `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, the values of `newn` and `newk` will determine the outcome. However, the exact values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not provided, so we cannot compute a specific numerical result. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `st`, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
