The expression `newn = newn - newk ** st` modifies the value of `newn`. The value of `newk ** st` is calculated based on the initial values of `newk` and `st`. Since `newn` is greater than `newk`, this operation will decrease `newn` but it will remain greater than `newk` after the operation. 

Specifically:

1. `newk` raised to the power of `st` (which is greater than 0) will yield a positive value.
2. `newn` will be decreased by that positive value. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the new value of `newn` after the operation, while the conditions regarding `newn` and `newk` remain true.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1), `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, which is equal to `2^st - 1; newn is decreased by newk ** st.`**
