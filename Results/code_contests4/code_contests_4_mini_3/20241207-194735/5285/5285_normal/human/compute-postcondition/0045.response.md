According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d_osn`. If `d_osn` has at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `izv` being a defaultdict of int type and `res` being -1 does not directly influence the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `d_osn` must contain at least one element, and `k` will be set to the first element in `d_osn`.

State: **`izv` is a defaultdict of int type, `res` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `d_osn` is a collection with at least 1 element, and k is the first element in `d_osn**
