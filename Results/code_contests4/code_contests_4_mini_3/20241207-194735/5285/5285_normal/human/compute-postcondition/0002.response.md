The code initializes `d_osn` as a defaultdict of integers. This means that `d_osn` is now capable of storing integer values with default behavior for non-existing keys. The existing values of `n`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `d_osn` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict(int)**
