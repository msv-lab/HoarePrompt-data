The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`. Since `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, this operation may reduce `newn` to a value less than `newnewk` depending on the values of `newk`, `st`, and `newn`. The other variables (`st`, `newizv`, `i`, and `izv`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is equal to `st`, and `izv` is incremented by `newizv`; `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`.
