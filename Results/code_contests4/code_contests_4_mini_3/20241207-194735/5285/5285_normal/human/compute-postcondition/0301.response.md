The value of `st` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `st` will be 3. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newk`, `newn`, `i`, `izv`, `newizv`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `newn` must be less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `newn` must be less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0**
