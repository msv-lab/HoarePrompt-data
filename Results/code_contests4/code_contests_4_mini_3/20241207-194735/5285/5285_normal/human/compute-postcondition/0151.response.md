According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop continues as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk`, and it has been decreased by `newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must still be greater than `newk ** st`.

Since `newn` was decreased by `newk`, for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be adjusted back to be greater than `newk ** st`. Therefore, the new condition should ensure that `newn` is sufficiently greater than `newk ** st`.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (st + 1); `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`**
