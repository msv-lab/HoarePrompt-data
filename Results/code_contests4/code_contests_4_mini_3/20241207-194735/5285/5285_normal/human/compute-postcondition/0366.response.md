According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `newnewk`.

Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared and we know that `newn` is currently less than or equal to `newk`, for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be at least as large as `newnewk`. Therefore, `newn` must be adjusted to be at least `newk` squared.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be at least as large as `newk` squared**
