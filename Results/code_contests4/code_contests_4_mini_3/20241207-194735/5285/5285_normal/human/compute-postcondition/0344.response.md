`newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 1, so after execution, `newizv` becomes `1 * 2 + 1`, which equals 3. The states of the other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 3.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 3**
