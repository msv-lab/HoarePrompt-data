According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. Since `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, it follows that for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` must be at least equal to `newnewk`, which means `newn` must be less than or equal to `newk`.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`**
