The variable `newn` is assigned the value `newn - newk ** st`. Since `st` is equal to `i`, we can express this as `newn = newn - newk ** i`. The value of `newk ** i` is calculated based on the current values of `newk` and `i`. The state of other variables remains the same as before. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `newn`, while indicating that `newn` is modified based on the power operation with `newk` and `i`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` while remaining in the loop since `newn` is still greater than `newk`; `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** i`.**
