`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The value of `newk` can be any value as long as `newn` is less than or equal to it, but since we don't have a specific value for `newk`, we cannot determine the exact value of `newnewk`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`**
