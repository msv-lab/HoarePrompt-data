Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk ** st`, `izv` is the total incremented by `newizv` for each iteration, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than the original value of `newn`, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, and `i` is equal to `st`.**
