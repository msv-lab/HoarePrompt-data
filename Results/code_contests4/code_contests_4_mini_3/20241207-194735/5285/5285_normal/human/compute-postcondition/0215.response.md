According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute again as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we should ensure that `newnewk` is still less than or equal to `newn`. Since `newnewk` is `newk` cubed, we need to ensure that `newk` cubed is still less than or equal to `newn`. This means `newn` must be adjusted to be at least equal to `newk` cubed or more.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- Since `newn` is currently greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1, it must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `newk` cubed for the loop to execute again.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` squared + 1, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed and for the loop to execute again `newn` should be greater than or equal to `newk` cubed**
