The expression `newnewk *= newk` means that `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` and the result is assigned back to `newnewk`. The value of `newnewk` is currently equal to `newk`. Therefore, `newnewk` will be updated to `newnewk * newk`, which is effectively `newk * newk` (or `newk**2`).

Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, after the execution, `newnewk` will be equal to `newk ** 2`.

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk ** 2`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10, `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk ** 2.**
