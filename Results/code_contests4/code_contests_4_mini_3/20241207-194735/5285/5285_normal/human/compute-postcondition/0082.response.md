The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The initial value of `izv` is `newizv + newizv`, which simplifies to `2 * newizv`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `izv` will be `2 * newizv + newizv`, which results in `3 * newizv`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`izv` is `3 * newizv`, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is `st + 1`, `st` is as defined, `newnewk` is equal to `k^(st + 1)`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`**.
