The value of `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`. Since `newnewk` was previously assigned the value of `newk * newk`, after executing the code, `newnewk` will now hold the value of `(newk * newk) * newk`, which simplifies to `newk^3`. 

The states of the other variables `newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk * newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk^3`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk * newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk^3`**
