The variable `newk` is assigned the value of `k`. The value of `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, which is not specified, but it is at least one element. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, and `newk` is equal to `k`.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` has at least 1 element, `k` is the first element in `d_osn`, `newk` is equal to `k`**
