The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. After execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` for each iteration until the loop condition fails.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` for each iteration until the loop condition fails.**
