The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, `st`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0**
