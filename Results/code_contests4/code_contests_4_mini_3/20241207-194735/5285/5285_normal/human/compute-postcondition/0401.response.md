Postcondition: ***`i` is 10, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `izv` has been updated based on the calculations performed in the loop. If `res` is equal to -1, then `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`, which is calculated as `izv // d_osn[k]`. Otherwise, if `res` is not equal to -1, then `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, and if `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is updated to the value of `mlt`.***
