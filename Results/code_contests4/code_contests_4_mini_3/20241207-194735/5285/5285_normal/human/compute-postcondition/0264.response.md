To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is greater than 0
- `i` is `st - 1`
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`

The loop condition requires that `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`. We know:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, which implies that `newk` must also be sufficiently large in order for `newk ** st` to be less than `newn`. 

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, it follows that `newk` must be adjusted so that the relationship `newk ** st < newn` holds true. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `newk` is not too large compared to `newn`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must be adjusted so that `newk ** st < newn`**.
