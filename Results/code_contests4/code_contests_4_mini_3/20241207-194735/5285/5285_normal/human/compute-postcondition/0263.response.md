To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the loop and the provided output states after each iteration. 

The loop executes `st` times, and during each iteration, the variable `newizv` is updated using the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1`. 

From the output states given after each iteration:

1. After 1 iteration: `newizv` is 1.
2. After 2 iterations: `newizv` is 3.
3. After 3 iterations: `newizv` is 7.

We can see a pattern in how `newizv` is being calculated:
- After the 1st iteration: `newizv = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`
- After the 2nd iteration: `newizv = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3`
- After the 3rd iteration: `newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 7`

This indicates that `newizv` is growing as a sequence of numbers represented by the formula `newizv = 2^n - 1`, where `n` is the number of iterations. 

Thus, after `st` iterations, `newizv` will be equal to `2^st - 1`.

Additionally, we know:
- `newnewk` remains greater than `newn`.
- `st` is a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations.
- `i` will be equal to `st - 1` after the loop completes.
  
If the loop does not execute, `st` would be 0, and `newizv` would remain 0.

In summary, after all iterations:
- If `st > 0`, `newizv` will be `2^st - 1`, `i` will be `st - 1`.
- If `st == 0`, `newizv` will remain 0 and `i` will be unchanged.

Assuming `st` is greater than 0, the output state is:

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`.**
