The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The values of `newn`, `st`, `i`, `izv`, and `newizv` remain unchanged. Since there is no specific value provided for `newk`, we cannot determine the exact impact on `newnewk`, but we know it takes the value of `newk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `newn` is greater than `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, and `newizv` is 0.**
