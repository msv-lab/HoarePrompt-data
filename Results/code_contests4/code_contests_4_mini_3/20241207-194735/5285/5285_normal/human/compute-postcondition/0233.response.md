The variable `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. Since `newizv` is defined as `2^st - 1`, we need to consider its current value based on the number of iterations `st`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, we can represent the output state as follows:

Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` that is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is equal to `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.**
