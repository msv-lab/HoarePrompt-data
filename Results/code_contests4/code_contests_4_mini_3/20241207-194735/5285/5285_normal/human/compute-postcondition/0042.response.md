Postcondition: ***`b` is reduced to its smallest prime factorization if it was divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of its original value. If `b` is greater than 2, then `d_osn[b]` is increased by 1, `cur` is a prime number greater than or equal to the square root of the original `b`, and `s` remains 0. If `b` is not greater than 2, the postcondition does not change as there is no else part.***
