To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that it fulfills all the requirements stated.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input Requirements**:
   - Three integers: `n` (number of boys), `m` (number of bikes), and `a` (shared budget).
   - A list of size `n` representing each boy's personal money.
   - A list of size `m` representing the renting prices of the bikes.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Two integers: 
     - `r`: the maximum number of boys that can rent bikes.
     - `s`: the minimum total personal money they must spend to rent these bikes.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Sorting**: The program sorts both the list of personal money of boys and the list of bike prices. This is a crucial step for efficiently pairing the cheapest available bike to the boys who can afford them.

2. **Binary Search**: The program employs a binary search to determine the maximum number of boys (`k`) that can rent bikes while ensuring the remaining budget (`left`) is non-negative, which is efficient for large inputs.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The function `func_1(k)` calculates the personal cost incurred by the boys and checks if the total cost fits within the budget.

### Potential Edge Cases

However, there is a potential edge case that needs to be considered:
- When the combined personal money of the boys is less than the total price of the cheapest `k` bikes, but the shared budget allows for some boys to ride bikes. The program might not correctly account for these situations if not enough boys can afford the cheapest bikes.

### Example Case to Test

Consider the following input:
```
3 3 10
1 2 3
10 5 6
```
- Here, we have 3 boys with personal budgets of 1, 2, and 3 rubles.
- The bike prices are 10, 5, and 6 rubles.

Even though the shared budget is 10 rubles, none of the boys can afford the cheapest bike (5 rubles) with their personal budgets. The program may mistakenly conclude that some boys can rent bikes due to the shared budget, but in reality, no bikes can be rented because they cannot pay their personal shares.

### Conclusion

The existing logic in the program does not comprehensively handle the situation where boys cannot rent bikes due to their personal budget constraints, despite the shared budget being sufficient. 

Correctness: **False**.
