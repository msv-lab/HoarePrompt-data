Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Rentals**: The loop iterates through `k` schoolboys and attempts to calculate the budget left after deducting the costs. However, the way the program computes the bike rental costs and personal contributions is flawed. Specifically, `pi = -k + i` will yield negative indices for personal money, which is not a valid operation since it will lead to accessing invalid elements in the `person` list.

2. **Calculation Errors**: The program attempts to calculate the amount of shared budget used and the total personal money spent, but the final value of `b` (which represents the total personal money spent) is incorrectly modified by the line `b -= left`. This does not reflect the true amount spent since it can lead to negative values for `b` after the loop, which contradicts the requirement that the total personal money spent must be non-negative.

3. **Output Mismatches**: The expected output from the function is two integers representing the maximum number of boys who can rent bikes and the minimum personal money spent. However, the function returns values that do not correspond to these requirements due to the aforementioned issues. 

4. **Edge Cases**: The program would fail in edge cases where, for example, no boys can afford any bikes or when the shared budget does not cover the minimum rental costs, as it does not properly account for these scenarios in its calculations.

Overall, the program fails to implement the correct logic for determining how many boys can rent bikes and how much personal money needs to be spent, which are critical components of the problem description.
