#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of schoolboys, m is a positive integer representing the number of available bikes, a is a non-negative integer representing the shared budget, b is a list of n positive integers where each bi represents the personal money of the i-th boy (1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4), and p is a list of m positive integers where each pj represents the rental price of the j-th bike (1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(k):
    left = a
    b = 0
    for i in range(k):
        pi = -k + i
        
        left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])
        
        b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `left` is `a`, `k` is a positive integer, `pi` remains negative for all iterations if `k` > 2.
    b -= left
    return b, left
    #The program returns b which is -a and left which is a
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `k` and processes lists of personal money and bike rental prices based on `k`. It calculates the total money `b` available after deducting the budget used for bike rentals from the initial budget `a`, resulting in `b` being equal to `-a` after the loop, and returns `b` and the remaining budget `left`, which remains equal to `a`.
