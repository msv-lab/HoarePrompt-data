The variable `pi` is assigned the value of `-k + i`. The value of `i` is 1, but the value of `k` is unknown, so `pi` will be calculated as `-k + 1`. The variable `b` remains 0 and `i` is still 1, as they are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` remains 0, `i` is 1, and `pi` is `-k + 1`.

Output State: **`b` remains 0, `i` is 1, and `pi` is `-k + 1**
