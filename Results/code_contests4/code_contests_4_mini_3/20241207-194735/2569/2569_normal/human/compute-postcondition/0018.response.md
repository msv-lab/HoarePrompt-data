Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `k` and processes lists of personal money and bike rental prices based on `k`. It calculates the total money `b` available after deducting the budget used for bike rentals from the initial budget `a`, resulting in `b` being equal to `-a` after the loop, and returns `b` and the remaining budget `left`, which remains equal to `a`.**
