According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `i` will be 2.

State: **`b` remains 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 2**
