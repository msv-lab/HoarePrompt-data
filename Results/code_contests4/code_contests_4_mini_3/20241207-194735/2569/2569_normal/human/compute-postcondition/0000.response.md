The variable `left` is assigned the value of `a`, which represents the shared budget. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `p`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a list of `n` positive integers, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, and `left` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a list of `n` positive integers, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, `left` is equal to `a**.
