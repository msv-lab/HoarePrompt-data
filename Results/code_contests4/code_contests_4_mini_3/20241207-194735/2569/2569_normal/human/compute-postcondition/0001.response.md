The variable `b` is assigned the value `0`, which directly changes its value from whatever it was previously (a list of `n` positive integers) to `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `p`, and `left`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, `left` is equal to `a`, and `b` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, `left` is equal to `a`, `b` is 0**
