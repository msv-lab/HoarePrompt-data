The variable `pi` is assigned the value `-k + i`. The initial value of `i` is 2, but the value of `k` is unknown and must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time. Therefore, `pi` will be calculated as `-k + 2`, where `k` is greater than 2. As `k` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `pi`. Thus, the output state is: `b` remains 0, `i` is 2, `pi` is -k + 2, where `k` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`b` remains 0, `i` is 2, `pi` is -k + 2, where `k` is greater than 2.**
