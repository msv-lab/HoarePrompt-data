According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1. The other states such as `n`, `m`, `a`, `p`, `left`, and `b` do not directly affect the execution of the loop; however, they may be relevant depending on the context of the loop body. 

Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers and `a` is a non-negative integer, we can conclude that the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, `left` is equal to `a`, `b` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
