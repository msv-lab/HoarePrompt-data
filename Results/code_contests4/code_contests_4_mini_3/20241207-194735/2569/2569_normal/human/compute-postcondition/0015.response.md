The variable `b` is decremented by the value of `left`, which is currently assigned as `a`. The previous value of `b` is 0, so after executing the code, `b` will become `0 - a`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is `-a`, `left` is `a`, `k` is a positive integer, `pi` remains negative for all iterations if `k` > 2.

Output State: **`b` is -a, `left` is a, `k` is a positive integer, `pi` remains negative for all iterations if `k` > 2**
