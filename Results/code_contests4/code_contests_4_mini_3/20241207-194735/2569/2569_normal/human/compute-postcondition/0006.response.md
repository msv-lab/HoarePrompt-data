According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop iterates `k` times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = k-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` remains 0 and `pi` is at most -1, indicating that the loop has not been able to access `person[pi]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is at its initial state (0) and has not been incremented, it can execute again if `k` is greater than 0. 

Thus, we can conclude that `i` should be incremented by 1 to prepare for the next iteration, making `i = 1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 1.

State: **`b` remains 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 1**
