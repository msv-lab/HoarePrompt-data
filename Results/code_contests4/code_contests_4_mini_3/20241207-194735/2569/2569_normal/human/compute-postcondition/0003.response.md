The variable `pi` is assigned the value of `-k + i`. The value of `i` is 0, and `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, the calculation results in `pi` being at most -1 (since `-k` will be negative and `i` is 0). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, `left` is equal to `a`, `b` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `pi` is at most -1.**
