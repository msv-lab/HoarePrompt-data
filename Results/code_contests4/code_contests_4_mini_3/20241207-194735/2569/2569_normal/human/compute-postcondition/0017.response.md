The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `k`. The parameter `k` is not explicitly described in the constraints provided. However, based on the output, it implies that the function performs calculations based on the input parameters that are defined by the context of schoolboys, bikes, budget, and their respective monetary values.

The function returns two values: `b`, which is defined as `-a`, and `left`, which is defined as `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the input and return specific values related to the budget and possibly the financial situation of the boys regarding the bikes.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter k and returns two values: b, which is -a, and left, which is a.**
