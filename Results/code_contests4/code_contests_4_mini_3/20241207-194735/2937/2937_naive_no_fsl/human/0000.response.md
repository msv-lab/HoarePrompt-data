Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it has a few issues:

1. **Invalid Age Handling**: The program does not check for ages that are not valid integers (e.g., negative ages or ages greater than 100). According to the problem description, ages should be between 0 and 1000, but the program currently assumes that if an input starts with a digit, it is a valid age.

2. **Drink Name Check**: The program does not account for the drink "WHISKEY," which is incorrectly spelled as "WISKEY" in the program. This means that anyone who might be drinking WHISKEY would not be counted as needing to be checked, which is a violation of the law.

3. **Input Constraints**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where the input might be malformed, such as receiving a non-integer or non-drink string. Since the problem guarantees that the input data does not contain unnecessary separators, this may not be an issue, but it is good practice to consider such edge cases.

Hence, due to these issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimal number of people Vasya should check to ensure compliance with the law.
