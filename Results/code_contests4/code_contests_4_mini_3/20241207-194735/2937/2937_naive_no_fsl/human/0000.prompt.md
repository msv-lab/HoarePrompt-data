You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: According to Berland laws it is only allowed to sell alcohol to people not younger than 18 years. Vasya's job is to monitor the law's enforcement. Tonight he entered a bar and saw n people sitting there. For every one of them Vasya happened to determine either the age or the drink the person is having. Vasya can check any person, i.e. learn his age and the drink he is having at the same time. What minimal number of people should Vasya check additionally to make sure that there are no clients under 18 having alcohol drinks?

The list of all alcohol drinks in Berland is: ABSINTH, BEER, BRANDY, CHAMPAGNE, GIN, RUM, SAKE, TEQUILA, VODKA, WHISKEY, WINE

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100) which is the number of the bar's clients. Then follow n lines, each describing one visitor. A line either contains his age (an integer from 0 to 1000) or his drink (a string of capital Latin letters from 1 to 100 in length). It is guaranteed that the input data does not contain spaces and other unnecessary separators.

Only the drinks from the list given above should be considered alcohol.

Output

Print a single number which is the number of people Vasya should check to guarantee the law enforcement.

Examples

Input

5
18
VODKA
COKE
19
17


Output

2

Note

In the sample test the second and fifth clients should be checked.
Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
res = 0
for rep in range(n):
    inp = raw_input()
    if inp[0] >= '0' and inp[0] <= '9':
        if int(inp) < 18:
            res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'ABSINTH':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'BEER':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'BRANDY':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'CHAMPAGNE':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'GIN':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'RUM':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'SAKE':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'TEQUILA':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'VODKA':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'WISKEY':
        res = res + 1
    elif inp == 'WINE':
        res = res + 1
print(res)
exit(0)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
