The variable `res` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `res` is not specified in the given initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` is increased by 1, but we cannot determine its exact value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `inp` is the user input, `res` is increased by 1**
