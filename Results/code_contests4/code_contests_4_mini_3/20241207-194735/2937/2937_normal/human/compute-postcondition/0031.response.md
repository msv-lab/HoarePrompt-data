The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since `res` was initially 0, it becomes 1 after the execution. The other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'TEQUILA'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'TEQUILA'**
