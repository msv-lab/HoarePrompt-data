The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The values of the other variables `n` and `rep` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, and `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.**
