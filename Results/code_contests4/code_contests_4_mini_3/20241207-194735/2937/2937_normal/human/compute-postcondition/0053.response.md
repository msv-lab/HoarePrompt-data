According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `rep` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute again if `rep` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `rep` is currently set to 0. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `rep` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `rep` will be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
