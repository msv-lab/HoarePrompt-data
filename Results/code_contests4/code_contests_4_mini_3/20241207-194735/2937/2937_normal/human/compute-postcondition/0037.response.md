The value of `res` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `res` is 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `rep`, `inp`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'WISKEY'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'WISKEY'**
