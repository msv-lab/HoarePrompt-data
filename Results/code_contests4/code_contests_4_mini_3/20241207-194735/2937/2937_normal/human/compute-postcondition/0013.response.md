The value of `res` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is an input string where the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH', and `inp` is equal to 'BEER'**
