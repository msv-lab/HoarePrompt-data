The code increments the value of `res` by 1. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is equal to 'RUM'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is equal to 'RUM'**
