`res` is assigned the value `res + 1`. Since `res` is initially 0, after the execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'ABSINTH'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'ABSINTH'**
