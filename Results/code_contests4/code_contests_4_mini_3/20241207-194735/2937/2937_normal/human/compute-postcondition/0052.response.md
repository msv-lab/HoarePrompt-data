Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; if the first character of `inp` is a digit, `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0 if the integer value of `inp` is less than 18; otherwise, `res` remains 0 and `rep` remains 0. If the first character of `inp` is not a digit, if `inp` is 'ABSINTH', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'ABSINTH'; if `inp` is one of the specified alcoholic beverages, then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is updated to that respective beverage; for any other value of `inp`, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` is not modified.***
