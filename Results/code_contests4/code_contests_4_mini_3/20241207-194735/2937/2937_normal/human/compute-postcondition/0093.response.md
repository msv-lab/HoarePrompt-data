The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown from the initial state. Therefore, we can't determine the new value of `res`. Other variables, `n` and `rep`, remain unchanged in this context. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `res` is increased by 1**
