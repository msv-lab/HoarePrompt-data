The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + 1`. Initially, `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE'**
