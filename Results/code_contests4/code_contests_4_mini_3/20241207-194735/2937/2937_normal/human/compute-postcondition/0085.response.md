The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is not defined in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) are unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `inp` is the user input, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `inp` is the user input, and `res` is increased by 1.**
