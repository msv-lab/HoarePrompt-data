Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; if `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE'. If `inp` is 'GIN', then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` is 'RUM', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'RUM'. If `inp` is 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is set to the respective string. For any other value of `inp`, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` is not modified.***
