The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown. The other variables `n` and `rep` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `res` without specifying its exact value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, `res` is increased by 1**
