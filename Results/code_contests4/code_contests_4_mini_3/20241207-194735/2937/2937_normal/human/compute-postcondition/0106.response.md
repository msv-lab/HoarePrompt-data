Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, and `inp` is the user input. If the first character of `inp` is a digit and `int(inp)` is less than 18, `res` is increased by 1. If `int(inp)` is 18 or greater, `res` remains unchanged. If the first character of `inp` is not a digit and `inp` is 'ABSINTH', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is not 'ABSINTH' but is 'BEER', then `res` is increased by 1; if `inp` is 'BRANDY' or 'CHAMPAGNE', `res` is also increased by 1; additionally, if `inp` is one of 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is also increased by 1.***
