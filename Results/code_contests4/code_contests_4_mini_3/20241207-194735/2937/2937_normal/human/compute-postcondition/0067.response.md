The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown as it is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` is increased by 1 without specifying its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, `inp` is an input string, and `res` is increased by 1.**
