The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not provided; thus, its specific value is unknown. The states of `n`, `rep`, and `inp` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, `inp` is an input string, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, `inp` is an input string, and `res` is increased by 1.**
