The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is not defined in the initial state. The values of the other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, `inp` is an input string, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, `inp` is an input string, and `res` is increased by 1.**
