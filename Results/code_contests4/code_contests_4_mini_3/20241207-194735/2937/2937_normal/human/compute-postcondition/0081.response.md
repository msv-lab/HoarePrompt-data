The code `inp = raw_input()` assigns the input value from the user to the variable `inp`. The previous states of the affected variables remain unchanged, as `n` and `rep` are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `rep`, along with the new variable `inp` which holds the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `inp` is the user input**
