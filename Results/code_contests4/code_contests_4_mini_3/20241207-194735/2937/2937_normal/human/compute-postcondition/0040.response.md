The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'WINE'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is 1; `rep` is 0; `inp` is 'WINE'**
