According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `rep = 0`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the loop will execute at least once. 

At the beginning of the loop, `res` is set to 0, and `rep` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `rep` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `res` is 0, `rep` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
