The code `exit(0)` is executed, which terminates the program immediately without modifying any variables. The previous values of `n`, `res`, and `rep` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `res` is the count of inputs that are either a number less than 18 or one of the specified alcoholic beverages; `rep` is equal to `n`; `res` is printed and the program exits without further action.
