Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; if `inp` is 'WISKEY', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'WISKEY'. If `inp` is 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'WINE'. If `inp` is anything else, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` is not modified.***
