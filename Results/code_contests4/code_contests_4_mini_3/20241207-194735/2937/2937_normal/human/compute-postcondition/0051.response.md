Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; if `inp` is 'ABSINTH', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'ABSINTH'. If `inp` is 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is updated to the respective string. For any other value of `inp`, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` is not modified.***
