Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, and `inp` is an input string. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is 'WISKEY' or 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `inp` is neither 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', nor 'WINE', then `res` remains unchanged.***
