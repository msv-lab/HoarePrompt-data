Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. If `inp` is 'SAKE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'SAKE'. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'TEQUILA'. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'VODKA'. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'WISKEY'. If `inp` is 'WINE', `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'WINE'. For any other value of `inp`, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` is not modified.***
