The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it processes input based on the constraints provided. The input consists of an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100), followed by `n` lines that contain either an integer representing an age (0 to 1000) or a string representing a drink (1 to 100 characters long) made up of capital Latin letters. 

The function analyzes the input as follows:
- If the input is an integer representing age, it checks if the age is less than 18. If it is, it considers the person a minor.
- If the input is a string representing a drink, it checks whether the drink is one of the specified alcoholic beverages.

The output consists of results based on these checks but does not return a value directly. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to process a list of ages and drinks, determining whether individuals are minors based on their ages and whether drinks are alcoholic based on their names.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of ages and drinks, identifying minors among the ages and determining whether the drinks are alcoholic based on specified criteria.**
