According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rep` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute again if `rep` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `rep` is 1, meaning it has executed once. Given that `n` is between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, `rep` will be increased by 1, changing it to 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
