The variable `res` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `res` is not provided, so we cannot determine its specific value after the increment. The values of the other variables `n` and `rep` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `inp` is the user input; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `inp` is the user input; `res` is increased by 1**
