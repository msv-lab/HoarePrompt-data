Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, and `inp` is the user input. If `inp` is 'BEER', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'BRANDY' or 'CHAMPAGNE', `res` is also increased by 1. Additionally, if `inp` is one of 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is increased by 1 as well.***
