The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `res`. The other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `inp` is the user input; `res` is increased by 1.**
