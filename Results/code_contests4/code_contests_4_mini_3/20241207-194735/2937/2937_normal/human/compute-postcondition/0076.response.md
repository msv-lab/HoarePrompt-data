Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 1, and `inp` is an input string. If `inp` is 'BRANDY', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is none of these specified strings, then `res` remains unchanged.***
