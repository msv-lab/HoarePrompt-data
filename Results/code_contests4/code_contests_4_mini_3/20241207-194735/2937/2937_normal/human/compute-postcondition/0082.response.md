The code snippet `res = res + 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. However, the initial value of `res` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. The other variables `n` and `rep` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `res` without specifying its new value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `rep` is 2, `inp` is the user input, `res` is increased by 1**
