The program is not correct based on the provided problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Age Checking Logic**: The program correctly checks if an input is a number and whether it is less than 18. However, it does not account for the possibility of ages being input as strings, which could lead to a TypeError when trying to convert them to integers.

2. **Drink Checking Logic**: The program checks for specific alcoholic drinks, but it erroneously includes "WISKEY" instead of the correct spelling "WHISKEY". This means a drink labeled "WHISKEY" would not be counted correctly. 

3. **Input Handling**: The program does not validate the input format. While it assumes that the input will always be well-formed (either an integer or a valid drink name), it does not handle any potential errors or invalid inputs.

4. **Output**: The print statement at the end outputs the count of people that Vasya should check, which is correct in intent, but since the counting logic contains errors, the output will be incorrect in case of any of the aforementioned issues.

5. **Logical Flow**: The program also lacks a more efficient way of checking the drinks by using a set or a list to store the alcoholic drinks rather than checking each one with a separate conditional statement.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases, especially regarding correct identification of alcoholic drinks and potential input errors.

Correctness: **False**
