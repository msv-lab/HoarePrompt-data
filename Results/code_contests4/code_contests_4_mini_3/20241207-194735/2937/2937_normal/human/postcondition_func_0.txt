The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of subsequent lines of input, which may contain either ages (0 to 1000) or names of drinks (alcoholic beverages). It counts how many of the inputs represent minors (ages less than 18) or are alcoholic drinks from a specified list, and prints this count. The function does not handle invalid inputs or non-integer values and assumes the input will be correctly formatted.
