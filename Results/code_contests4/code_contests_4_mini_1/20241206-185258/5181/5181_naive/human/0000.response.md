To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and how it relates to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- A good string consists of only 'a' and 'b', with no two consecutive letters being the same.
- We have `a` strings of "a", `b` strings of "b", and `c` strings of "ab".
- We want to find the maximum length of a good string that can be formed.

### Program Analysis:
The program is written as follows:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(a + b) + 2 * c
```

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. It reads three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. The expression `a + b` computes the total number of 'a' and 'b' strings directly.
3. The term `2 * c` accounts for the contribution of the "ab" strings, as each "ab" adds 2 characters to the good string.

### Expected Logic:
To form the longest good string:
- Each "ab" contributes 2 characters.
- The remaining strings of "a" and "b" can be added as long as they alternate.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's consider the outputs for various combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

1. If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`:
   - Expected output: "baba" has a length of 4.
   - Program output: `1 + 1 + 2 * 1 = 4` (Correct)

2. If `a = 2`, `b = 1`, `c = 2`:
   - Expected output: "abababa" has a length of 7.
   - Program output: `2 + 1 + 2 * 2 = 7` (Correct)

3. If `a = 3`, `b = 5`, `c = 2`:
   - Expected output: "bababababab" has a length of 11.
   - Program output: `3 + 5 + 2 * 2 = 11` (Correct)

4. If `a = 2`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`:
   - Expected output: "ababab" has a length of 6.
   - Program output: `2 + 2 + 2 * 1 = 6` (Correct)

5. If `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`, `c = 1000000000`:
   - Expected output: "abab...ab" with a length of 4000000000.
   - Program output: `1000000000 + 1000000000 + 2 * 1000000000 = 4000000000` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
Now, let's consider any potential edge cases or miscalculations. 

- For extreme values (e.g., when `a` or `b` is much larger than the other), we should still be able to form a good string as long as we have sufficient "ab" strings to maintain the alternation.
- If `c` is zero, the program still accurately counts `a + b` for the contribution from "a" and "b".

### Conclusion:
The program accurately calculates the maximum length of the good string based on the number of "a", "b", and "ab" strings. There are no cases where the program fails to adhere to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
