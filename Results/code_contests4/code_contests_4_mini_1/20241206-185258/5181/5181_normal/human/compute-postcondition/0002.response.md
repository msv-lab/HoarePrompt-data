The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. All three parameters are positive integers constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. Since there is no specific output description provided for the function, we cannot ascertain what the function returns based on the given information. Therefore, we can only summarize the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integer parameters a, b, and c, each constrained to the range of 1 to 10^9.**
