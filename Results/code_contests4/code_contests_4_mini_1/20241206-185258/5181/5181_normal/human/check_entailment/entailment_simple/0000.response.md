The given program is intended to calculate the maximum possible length of a "good" string based on the counts of strings "a", "b", and "ab". 

The problem description states that:
1. A "good" string consists only of 'a' and 'b' with no two consecutive letters being the same.
2. The input consists of three positive integers representing the counts of these strings.
3. The output should be the length of the longest concatenated "good" string possible.

### Analyzing the Annotated Program:
The function defined in the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input. It then calculates the result using the expression `print(a + b) + 2 * c`.

#### Breakdown of the Calculation:
- `a + b`: This counts the total contributions of the standalone strings "a" and "b".
- `2 * c`: Each "ab" string can contribute two characters to the final string, one 'a' and one 'b'. Thus, the total contribution from `c` strings is `2 * c`.

So, the combined expression effectively calculates the total length of the longest possible string that can be formed by using:
- All standalone 'a's and 'b's
- Each 'ab' string contributing two characters.

### Checking for Correctness:
1. The program correctly adds the contributions from `a`, `b`, and `ab` to form the length of the longest good string.
2. The logic does not violate any of the rules specified in the problem description regarding the formation of "good" strings.

### Conclusion:
Given each part of the calculation aligns with the requirements of the problem description, the program correctly calculates the maximum length of a good string that can be formed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
