To analyze the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate the logic implemented in the code as well as the behavior described in the output hints.

### Problem description:
The goal is to determine the maximum length of a "good" string that can be formed using a given number of strings "a", "b", and "ab". A good string consists only of the letters 'a' and 'b', with no two consecutive letters being the same. The lengths of the strings formed by using the available "a", "b", and "ab" strings should be calculated correctly.

### Program:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(a + b) + 2 * c
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the logic**:
   - The program reads three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It computes the result as `a + b + 2 * c`, which implies that:
     - Each "a" contributes 1 to the string length.
     - Each "b" contributes 1 to the string length.
     - Each "ab" contributes 2 to the string length, as it can be used as one 'a' followed by one 'b' (or vice versa).

2. **Output hints**:
   - The hints state that the function calculates `a + b + 2 * c` to determine the maximum length of the good string.
   - They also indicate that the result is printed directly.

3. **Evaluating correctness**:
   - The formula `a + b + 2 * c` correctly accounts for the contributions of the strings to the total length.
   - However, the problem description requires that the resulting string must be a "good" string. This means that the function must ensure that a good string can actually be formed, with alternating 'a's and 'b's.

### Edge Cases:
- A scenario where `a` or `b` is significantly smaller than the other could lead to a limitation in forming a good string. For example:
  - If `a = 1`, `b = 5`, and `c = 0`, the best we can do is "ababa", which has a length of 5, not 7 as calculated by the formula.
  
### Conclusion:
The formula `a + b + 2 * c` does not take into account the constraints of forming a valid "good" string when the counts of 'a's and 'b's are imbalanced. Therefore, there are potential cases where the output will not yield a valid "good" string of maximum length as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**. 
The code fails to handle edge cases where the number of 'a's and 'b's are not balanced, which can prevent the formation of a valid "good" string.
