To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it accurately calculates the maximum possible length of the good string based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Good String Definition**: A string is good if it consists of only 'a' and 'b', and no two consecutive characters are the same.
2. **Input Parameters**: 
   - `a`: the number of single 'a' strings.
   - `b`: the number of single 'b' strings.
   - `c`: the number of 'ab' strings.

### Expected Logic:
To maximize the length of a good string:
- Each 'ab' string contributes a length of 2 to the total string.
- The single 'a' and 'b' strings can be used to alternate characters.

### Calculation:
- Using `c` 'ab' strings contributes `2 * c` to the total length.
- The remaining 'a' and 'b' strings can be used to alternate after the 'ab' strings.
- The total length for the single 'a' and 'b' strings combined should ideally be:
  - If you have an equal number of 'a' and 'b', they can fully alternate.
  - If the counts are unequal, you can only use min(a, b) pairs and one additional (either 'a' or 'b') depending on which count is greater.

### Program Logic:
The provided program calculates the length as:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(a + b) + 2 * c
```
This seems to be incorrect because it calculates `a + b + 2 * c`, but it does not account for the alternating pattern needed between 'a' and 'b' after using 'ab' strings.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the case where:
- `a = 2`
- `b = 1`
- `c = 0`

According to the logic:
- The expected good string could be "aba" which has a length of 3.
- However, the program would compute: `2 + 1 + 2 * 0 = 3`, which is correct in this case, but it doesn't generalize well for varying counts.

Now consider:
- `a = 3`
- `b = 5`
- `c = 0`
  
The expected good string can be "ababababab" which has a length of 11. The program would compute `3 + 5 + 2 * 0 = 8`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle all edge cases correctly and produces incorrect results for certain inputs, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
