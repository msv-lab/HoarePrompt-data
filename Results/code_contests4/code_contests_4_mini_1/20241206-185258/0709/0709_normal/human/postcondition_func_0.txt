The function accepts three non-negative integers `r`, `g`, and `b`, representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. It calculates a value `t` based on the number of red balloons and the number of green and blue balloons after adjusting for the number of red balloons. The function may call another function `func_2` with the computed value `t`. However, it does not return a value directly. The function also does not handle cases where the input is invalid or does not adhere to the specified constraints.
