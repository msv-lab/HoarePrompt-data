The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the variables `r`, `g`, and `b`, which are non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively, with the constraint that \(0 \leq r, g, b \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\). 

The function returns values based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If the total number of balloons (r + g + b) is less than or equal to 0, it returns a message indicating that there are no balloons.
- Case_2: If the total number of balloons is an odd number, it returns "odd".
- Case_3: If the total number of balloons is an even number, it returns "even".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to evaluate the total number of balloons represented by `r`, `g`, and `b`, and returns a message indicating whether there are no balloons, or whether the total number of balloons is odd or even.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, evaluates the total number of balloons given by r, g, and b, and returns a message indicating if there are no balloons, or if the total is odd or even.**
