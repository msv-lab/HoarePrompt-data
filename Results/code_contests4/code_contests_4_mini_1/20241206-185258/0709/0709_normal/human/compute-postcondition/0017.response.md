The variable `x` is converted to a string using `str(x)` and then written to the `file`. The values of `r`, `g`, `b`, `sep`, and `at_start` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The state of `file` indicates that some data is being written to the standard output, but we do not know the specific value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, and `x` is written to `file` as a string.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is a space character, `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, and `x` is written to `file` as a string.**
