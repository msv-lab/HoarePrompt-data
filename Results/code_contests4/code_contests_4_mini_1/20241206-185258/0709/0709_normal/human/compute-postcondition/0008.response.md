The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, but it was already `False` prior to this assignment, meaning its value does not change. The values of the other variables (`r`, `g`, `b`, `sep`, `file`) remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is a space character, `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False**
