The code snippet does not modify any of the initial variables `r`, `g`, or `b`. Instead, it assigns default values to `sep` and `file` from a dictionary `kwargs`, which is not provided in the initial state. The initial values of `r`, `g`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of `r`, `g`, and `b`, and notes the default values assigned to `sep` and `file`.

Output State: **`r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers; `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout**
