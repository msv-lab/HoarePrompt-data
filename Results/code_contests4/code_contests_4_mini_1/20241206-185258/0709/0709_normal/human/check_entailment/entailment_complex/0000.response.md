To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code carefully, including the annotations, and compare them to the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to decorate tables using red, green, and blue balloons. Each table requires exactly three balloons of different colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of tables (`t`) that can be decorated given the counts of each colored balloon (`r`, `g`, `b`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by sorting the balloon counts. 
   - It initializes `t` to `r`, indicating that we can initially make `r` tables using only red balloons if we had enough of the other colors.
   - It decreases the counts of green and blue (`g` and `b`) by the number of red balloons used (`r`).
   - It computes how many additional tables can be made from the remaining green balloons by dividing by 3.
   - The remainder of green balloons (`g`) is checked for combinations with blue balloons (`b`) to see if one or two more tables can be decorated.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2(t)` to print the result.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where all balloon counts are zero. The output should be `0` in this scenario, but the logic might lead to an incorrect count.
   - If the sorted values of `r`, `g`, and `b` are such that two colors are zero, the program may not correctly account for the maximum tables.

### Example Scenarios:
1. **Example Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Actual Output: The program may not handle this case correctly, potentially leading to undefined behavior.

2. **Example Input**: `2 2 2`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The calculations should yield `2`, which seems correct.

3. **Example Input**: `1 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program should not allow any tables since there are not enough colors.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge case of all counts being zero or when two colors are completely missing, and hence it may not produce the expected results for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program does not comply with the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
