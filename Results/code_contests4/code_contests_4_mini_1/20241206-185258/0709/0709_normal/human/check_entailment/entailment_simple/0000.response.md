To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The program is tasked with determining the maximum number of tables that can be decorated using exactly three balloons of different colors (red, green, and blue). The constraints are that no table can have balloons of the same color and the counts of the balloons are provided as non-negative integers.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes the input of three integers, `r`, `g`, and `b` (the counts of red, green, and blue balloons), and sorts them. Sorting ensures that we always have the smallest count first, which helps in managing the allocation of balloons effectively.

2. **Logic for Table Decoration**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to the count of the smallest balloon color (`r` after sorting).
   - The program then attempts to utilize the remaining balloons (`g` and `b`) to form more tables. 
   - It uses integer division and modular arithmetic to calculate how many complete sets of three can be formed from the remaining balloons after deducting the counted smallest color balloons.
   - The last part of the logic checks if there is an additional possibility of forming a table with one or two leftover balloons (`g`).

3. **Output**: The function `func_2()` is responsible for outputting the result, but it is not correctly defined. It seems to lack parameters for `args`, hence will not execute properly in its current state.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program logic for calculating the maximum number of tables seems reasonable based on the balloon counts and constraints. However, the output function is not correctly set up to receive and print the value of `t` (the number of tables). This means that even if the program correctly calculates the number of tables, it will fail to produce the intended output.

### Conclusion
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because the output function is incorrectly defined and will lead to execution errors.

Correctness: **False**
