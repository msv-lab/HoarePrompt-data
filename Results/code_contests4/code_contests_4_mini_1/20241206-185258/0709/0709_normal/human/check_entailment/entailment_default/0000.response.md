To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The program must compute the maximum number of tables (`t`) that can be decorated with balloons of three different colors: red (`r`), green (`g`), and blue (`b`). Each table requires exactly three balloons, all of different colors.

### Code Examination
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It first sorts the number of balloons of each color.
   - It assigns the smallest value (red balloons) to `t`.
   - It reduces the counts of green and blue balloons by the number of red balloons.
   - It then adds to `t` by calculating how many sets of three can be made from the remaining green balloons and adjusts the blue count accordingly.
   - Finally, it checks how many additional tables can be decorated based on the remaining green and blue balloons.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function simply prints whatever is passed to it.

### Output Hints
The output hints describe the function's behavior but also mention that it does not handle invalid input cases or constraints directly.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
- **Distribution of Balloons**: The code seems to focus on the minimum number of red balloons. However, if `r`, `g`, or `b` is significantly larger than the others, it may not fully utilize the available balloons. For example, if we have `r = 0`, `g = 5`, `b = 5`, the output should be `0` as there are no red balloons to decorate a table, but the code might not handle this logic correctly. It will only consider the smallest value.
- **All Zeroes**: If all balloon counts are zero (i.e., `0 0 0`), the output should also be `0`, but the current logic might not cover this explicitly.
- **Constraints**: The code does not check for invalid inputs or negative values, although the input constraints specify non-negative integers.

### Agreement with Output Hints
The output hints state that the function calculates `t` based on the number of red balloons and adjusts for the green and blue. However, they do not explicitly call out potential issues regarding edge cases, leading to a lack of confidence in its correctness across all scenarios.

### Conclusion
Given that the code does not handle cases where one of the balloon colors is zero correctly (which can lead to incorrect calculations), and given the lack of checks for constraints, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle cases where one or more colors of balloons are zero, which is essential for determining the maximum number of tables that can be decorated.
