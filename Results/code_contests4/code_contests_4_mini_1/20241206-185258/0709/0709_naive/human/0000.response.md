To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's first understand the requirements and then look at the code logic.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- We need to decorate tables with exactly three balloons of different colors (red, green, blue).
- The maximum number of tables that can be decorated must be computed based on the available balloons (r, g, b).

**Program Overview:**
```python
def func_1():
    (r, g, b) = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    t = r
    g -= r
    b -= r
    t += g // 3
    b -= g - g % 3
    g = g % 3
    t += (g == 1 and b > 1) + (g == 2 and b > 0)
    func_2(t)
```
The function `func_1` reads the number of balloons of each color, sorts them, and calculates the maximum number of tables.

1. **Sorting Balloons**: The balloons are sorted so that `r` is the smallest, which might not be the best approach as it does not guarantee that we will use the largest counts effectively.
2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - It initializes `t` with `r`.
   - It then attempts to make use of `g` and `b` after reducing them by `r`.
   - The way `g` and `b` are adjusted seems to focus on using multiples of three, but does not fully account for cases where we might still have leftover balloons that could create additional tables.

**Potential Issue**:
Consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 2 2`
- According to the problem, we can form 2 tables using (r, g, b) combinations like (R, G, B) and (R, G, B) again. However, the logic here would calculate `t` as follows:
  - After sorting, we have `r=2, g=2, b=2`.
  - It sets `t = 2`, then reduces `g` and `b` by `r`, leaving `g = 0` and `b = 0`.
  - It adds `g // 3` which is `0`, and will not add anything for leftover balloons.
  - The final result will yield `t = 2`.

In this case, it works correctly, but if we try to maximize the tables in a situation where the distribution of the colors is different, we can find cases where it fails.

**Test Case for Failure**:
- Input: `1 2 3`
- The expected output is `1` (one table of one of each color). The logic in the function will go through the same process and may not correctly utilize the balloons since it heavily relies on the sorting mechanism and then the modulo operations.

In conclusion, the program does not handle all edge cases properly and may lead to incorrect calculations of the maximum number of tables that can be formed under certain distributions of balloons.

Correctness: **False**.
