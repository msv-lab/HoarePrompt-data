To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with the balloons given the constraints of not using the same color more than once on a table.

The core logic of the `func_1()` function appears to be as follows:

1. It sorts the number of balloons of each color (red, green, blue) to always work with the smallest amount first. This is a reasonable approach since it ensures that we can maximize the number of tables.
2. It initializes `t` with the count of the smallest balloon color (which is `r` after sorting).
3. It reduces the counts of the other colors by the smallest count, simulating the use of those balloons to create tables.
4. It calculates how many complete sets of three can be made from the remaining balloons of the second smallest color (`g`) and adjusts the count of the third color (`b`) accordingly.
5. Finally, it checks if any remaining balloons can form additional tables based on the leftovers of `g` and `b`.

This logic should generally work well. However, let's examine edge cases, particularly when one or more balloon colors are zero:

1. **Edge Case 1:** When `r = 0`, `g = 0`, `b = 0`
   - Expected output: `0` (no balloons)
   - The program initializes `t` to `0`, which is correct.

2. **Edge Case 2:** When `r = 0`, `g = 0`, `b = 5`
   - Expected output: `0` (can't form a table without using the same color)
   - The program initializes `t` to `0`, which is correct.

3. **Edge Case 3:** When `r = 0`, `g = 5`, `b = 5`
   - Expected output: `0` (same as above)
   - The program initializes `t` to `0`, which is correct.

4. **Edge Case 4:** When `r = 1`, `g = 1`, `b = 0`
   - Expected output: `0` (only two balloons)
   - The program initializes `t` to `1`, which is incorrect.

5. **Edge Case 5:** When `r = 0`, `g = 1`, `b = 1`
   - Expected output: `0` (only two balloons)
   - The program initializes `t` to `1`, which is incorrect.

From these edge cases, we can see that the program fails to account for situations where there are not enough balloons to form a complete set of three distinct colors. Specifically, the logic allows for an initialization of `t` that is not constrained by the total number of balloons available. 

Given these observations, we conclude that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
