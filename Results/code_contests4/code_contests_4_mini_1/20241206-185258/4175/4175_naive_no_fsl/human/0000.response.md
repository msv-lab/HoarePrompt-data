To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it meets all the requirements specified.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Input Specification**:
   - The program reads values for the number of towns (N), roads (M), and the number of towns Joisino will visit (R).
   - It then reads the indices of the towns Joisino will visit and the roads information, which includes pairs of towns connected by a road and the length of that road.

2. **Goal**:
   - The goal is to compute the minimum distance traveled by road for Joisino when visiting the towns in an optimal order, flying to the first town and flying back from the last town.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the towns are connected and that the input follows the specified format.

### Program Analysis:

The program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths between the towns and then evaluates all permutations of the order of towns Joisino will visit to find the minimal road distance.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
- It constructs a distance matrix using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- It computes all permutations of the towns to find the optimal visiting order.
- It calculates the total road distance for each permutation and keeps track of the minimum distance.

### Potential Issues to Verify:

1. **Input Handling**: The program assumes correctly formatted input. If the input format is not adhered to (for example, fewer roads than expected), the program may fail.

2. **Permutations**: The program uses permutations to find the optimal path. If R is large (up to 8), this results in a factorial time complexity (8! = 40,320 permutations), which could lead to inefficiencies or timeouts in larger cases.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The use of Dijkstra's algorithm should correctly calculate the shortest paths. However, there may be edge cases where certain roads create unexpected longer paths due to the graph structure.

### Edge Case Testing:

1. **Minimum Input Values**:
   - Test with the minimum number of towns and roads to see if the program handles small graphs properly.

2. **Disconnected Graph**: Although the problem states that all towns can be reached, testing with an edge case where towns are only connected in a linear fashion could be insightful.

3. **Different Permutation Orders**: Test cases where the best route is not immediately obvious due to various road lengths.

4. **Duplicate Roads**: Since the program enforces unique roads, testing it with cases where different paths exist between the same towns could show if it correctly identifies the shortest.

5. **Maximum Constraints**: Test with N = 200 and R = 8 to check for performance and correctness under maximum input constraints.

### Conclusion:

After considering the analysis and potential edge cases, I find that the program's correctness can be compromised by edge cases that were not explicitly tested in the examples.

For instance, if there are two towns connected by multiple roads with different lengths, the program may not handle this correctly if the Dijkstra's implementation does not account for the shortest road properly.

Therefore, since we can conceive of cases where the program may not function as expected due to its permutation approach combined with the shortest path search, it leads us to conclude:

Correctness: **False**
