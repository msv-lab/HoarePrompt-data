#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 200, M is an integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ N × (N - 1) / 2, R is an integer such that 2 ≤ R ≤ min(8, N), r_i are unique integers representing the towns Joisino visits, where 1 ≤ r_i ≤ N, and A_i, B_i are integers representing the roads connecting towns with lengths C_i, where 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N, A_i ≠ B_i, and 1 ≤ C_i ≤ 100000.
def func():
    f = lambda : list(map(int, input().split()))
    N, M, R = f()
    r = f()
    a, b, c = zip(*map(f, [0] * M))
    a = csgraph.dijkstra(csr_matrix((c, (a, b)), [N + 1] * 2), 0, r)
    print(int(min(sum(a[e[i]][r[e[i + 1]]] for i in range(R - 1)) for e in
    __import__('itertools').permutations(range(R)))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input values for the number of towns (N), the number of roads (M), and the number of towns to visit (R), along with the specific towns and the road connections with their lengths. It calculates the shortest path to visit all specified towns using Dijkstra's algorithm and returns the minimum total distance by exploring all permutations of the towns to be visited. The function does not explicitly handle invalid input cases or constraint violations as described in the annotations.
