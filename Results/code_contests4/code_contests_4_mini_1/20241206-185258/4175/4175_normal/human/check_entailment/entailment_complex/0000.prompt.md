You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N towns in the State of Atcoder, connected by M bidirectional roads.

The i-th road connects Town A_i and B_i and has a length of C_i.

Joisino is visiting R towns in the state, r_1,r_2,..,r_R (not necessarily in this order).

She will fly to the first town she visits, and fly back from the last town she visits, but for the rest of the trip she will have to travel by road.

If she visits the towns in the order that minimizes the distance traveled by road, what will that distance be?

Constraints

* 2≤N≤200
* 1≤M≤N×(N-1)/2
* 2≤R≤min(8,N) (min(8,N) is the smaller of 8 and N.)
* r_i≠r_j (i≠j)
* 1≤A_i,B_i≤N, A_i≠B_i
* (A_i,B_i)≠(A_j,B_j),(A_i,B_i)≠(B_j,A_j) (i≠j)
* 1≤C_i≤100000
* Every town can be reached from every town by road.
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M R
r_1 ... r_R
A_1 B_1 C_1
:
A_M B_M C_M


Output

Print the distance traveled by road if Joisino visits the towns in the order that minimizes it.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 200, M is an integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ N × (N - 1) / 2, R is an integer such that 2 ≤ R ≤ min(8, N), r_i are unique integers representing the towns Joisino visits, where 1 ≤ r_i ≤ N, and A_i, B_i are integers representing the roads connecting towns with lengths C_i, where 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N, A_i ≠ B_i, and 1 ≤ C_i ≤ 100000.
def func():
    f = lambda : list(map(int, input().split()))
    N, M, R = f()
    r = f()
    a, b, c = zip(*map(f, [0] * M))
    a = csgraph.dijkstra(csr_matrix((c, (a, b)), [N + 1] * 2), 0, r)
    print(int(min(sum(a[e[i]][r[e[i + 1]]] for i in range(R - 1)) for e in
    __import__('itertools').permutations(range(R)))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input values for the number of towns (N), the number of roads (M), and the number of towns to visit (R), along with the specific towns and the road connections with their lengths. It calculates the shortest path to visit all specified towns using Dijkstra's algorithm and returns the minimum total distance by exploring all permutations of the towns to be visited. The function does not explicitly handle invalid input cases or constraint violations as described in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
