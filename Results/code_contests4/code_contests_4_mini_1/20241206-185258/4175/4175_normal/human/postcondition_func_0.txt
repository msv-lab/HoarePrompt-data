The function accepts input values for the number of towns (N), the number of roads (M), and the number of towns to visit (R), along with the specific towns and the road connections with their lengths. It calculates the shortest path to visit all specified towns using Dijkstra's algorithm and returns the minimum total distance by exploring all permutations of the towns to be visited. The function does not explicitly handle invalid input cases or constraint violations as described in the annotations.
