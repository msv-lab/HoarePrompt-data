Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 200, M is an integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ N × (N - 1) / 2, R is an integer such that 2 ≤ R ≤ min(8, N), r_i are unique integers representing the towns Joisino visits, where 1 ≤ r_i ≤ N, and A_i, B_i are integers representing the roads connecting towns with lengths C_i, where 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N, A_i ≠ B_i, and 1 ≤ C_i ≤ 100000; f is a lambda function that returns a list of integers from input.**
