The code `a, b, c = zip(*map(f, [0] * M))` processes a list of zeroes of length `M`. The function `f` is applied to each zero in the list, creating a new iterable of results. The `zip` function then unpacks the results into three separate tuples, `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

Since `f` returns a list of integers, we can assume that each call to `f(0)` produces a list of three integers. Therefore, if `f(0)` returns a list of three integers `x, y, z`, then the output of `zip` will create three tuples containing all the first elements, second elements, and third elements respectively from the results of `f`.

The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown, but they will be assigned new values based on the output of `f`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now tuples containing the results of the mapping operation.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are tuples containing the results of `f(0)` applied `M` times, where each result is a list of three integers.**
