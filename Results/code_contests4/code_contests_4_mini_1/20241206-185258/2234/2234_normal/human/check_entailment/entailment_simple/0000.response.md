The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic to Determine Substring Order**: The program constructs a dictionary `dict1` that counts how many strings in the list contain each string as a substring. However, this does not directly help in determining if the strings can be reordered such that each string is a substring of the strings that follow it. The problem requires checking the actual substring relationships among all strings, not just counting occurrences.

2. **Misleading Count Logic**: The condition `if (c2 > 1)` is not appropriate for determining the impossibility of rearranging strings. The problem requires that for every string, all preceding strings must be its substrings. The current check only considers how many strings contain each string, which does not address whether all strings before a given string are its substrings.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output does not adhere to the requirement of printing "NO" or "YES" followed by the strings in the correct order. The logic to print strings based on their counts does not guarantee they are arranged correctly as substrings.

4. **Unsorted Output**: After determining that a valid ordering is possible, the program does not ensure that the output is sorted in the required substring order. It simply prints the strings as they are counted, which can lead to an incorrect order.

Given these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
