The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` strings of lowercase English letters (each string length from 1 to 100). It counts how many times each string appears as a substring in the list of strings. If there is more than one string that appears as a substring in exactly one other string, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints each string that appeared as a substring the number of times it was counted in the input list. This function does not handle cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., if `n` is not within the specified range or if the strings do not meet the length requirements).
