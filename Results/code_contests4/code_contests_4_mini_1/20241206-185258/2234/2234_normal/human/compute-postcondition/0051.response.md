`count` is incremented by 1, so its new value will be 3. The values of `ls` and `z` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is now 3, `ls` is a list with at least 2 elements, `z` is the second element in `ls`.

Output State: **`count` is now 3, `ls` is a list with at least 2 elements, `z` is the second element in `ls`**
