According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sorted_x`. For the loop to execute at least once, `sorted_x` must contain at least one tuple. The state indicates that `c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, and it is stated that `c2` is less than or equal to 1. This means that there are either no tuples with the second element as 1, or at most one such tuple.

Since it is possible for `sorted_x` to be empty (which would mean the loop cannot execute), we need to ensure that `sorted_x` contains at least one tuple. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `sorted_x` must have at least one tuple, and we can set `x` to the first tuple in `sorted_x`.

State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1; for the loop to execute, `sorted_x` must contain at least 1 tuple, and `x` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`**
