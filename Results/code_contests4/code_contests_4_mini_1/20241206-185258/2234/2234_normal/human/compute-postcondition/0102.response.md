The value `x` is the third tuple in `sorted_x`, so `x[0]` refers to the first element of that tuple. The print statement outputs the value of `x[0]`. The variables `c2`, `c1`, and `z` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `x` is the third tuple in `sorted_x`, `c1` is greater than `z + 1`, and `z` is `z + 1; `x[0]` has been printed.**
