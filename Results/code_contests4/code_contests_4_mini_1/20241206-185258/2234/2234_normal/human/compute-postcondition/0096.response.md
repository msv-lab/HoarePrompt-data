`c1` is assigned the value of the count of `x[0]` in `ls`. The previous value of `c1` is unknown, but it will now hold the count of occurrences of the first element of the tuple `x` in the list `ls`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `x` is the third tuple in `sorted_x`, `c1` is now the count of `x[0]` in `ls`, `z` is `c1 - 1` if `c1` is greater than 0, otherwise `z` does not exist, and for the loop to execute again `sorted_x` must have at least 3 tuples.

Output State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `x` is the third tuple in `sorted_x`, `c1` is now the count of `x[0]` in `ls`, `z` is `c1 - 1` if `c1` is greater than 0, otherwise `z` does not exist, and for the loop to execute again `sorted_x` must have at least 3 tuples.**
