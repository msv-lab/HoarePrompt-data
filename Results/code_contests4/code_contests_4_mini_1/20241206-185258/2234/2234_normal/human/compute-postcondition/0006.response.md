According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1; `ls` contains the string `a`; `a` is an input string.**
