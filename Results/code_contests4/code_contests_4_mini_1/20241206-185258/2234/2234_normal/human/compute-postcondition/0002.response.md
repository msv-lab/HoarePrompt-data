According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer but its specific value is not known. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. 

Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that its value is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The conditions on `n` and `ls` do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is greater than 0, `ls` is an empty list**
