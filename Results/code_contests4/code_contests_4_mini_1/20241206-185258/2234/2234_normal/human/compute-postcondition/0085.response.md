Output State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1; `x` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`; `c1` is the count of `x[0]` in `ls`; `z` is `c1 - 1` if `c1` is greater than 0, otherwise `z` does not exist. The first element of `x` is printed `c1` times if `c1` is greater than 0, otherwise nothing is printed.**
