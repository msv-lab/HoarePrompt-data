The variable `a` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts input from the user as a string. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `t` is greater than 0 and `ls` is an empty list, those remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is greater than 0, `ls` is an empty list, and `a` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is greater than 0, `ls` is an empty list, `a` is an input string**.
