The code initializes `dict1` as an empty dictionary. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `ls`, or `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` contains `t` input strings, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `dict1` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` contains `t` input strings, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `dict1` is an empty dictionary.**
