According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c1`. The loop will execute if `c1` is at least 1. The state before the loop indicates that `c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `x` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`, and `c1` is the count of `x[0]` in `ls`. For the loop to execute at least once, `c1` must be greater than 0. 

Therefore, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:
- `c1` must be greater than 0.
- `z` will start at 0 (the first value in the range).

State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `x` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`, `c1` is greater than 0, `z` is 0**
