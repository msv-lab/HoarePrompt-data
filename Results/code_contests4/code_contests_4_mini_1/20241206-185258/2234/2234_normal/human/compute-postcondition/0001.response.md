`ls` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `t` is assigned a value based on user input, but it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an input integer; `ls` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an input integer; `ls` is an empty list**.
