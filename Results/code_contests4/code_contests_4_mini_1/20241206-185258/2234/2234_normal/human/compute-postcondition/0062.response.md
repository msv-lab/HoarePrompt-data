According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sorted_x`. If `sorted_x` contains at least one item, the loop will execute. The state of `dict1` and `c2` does not affect the ability of the loop to start. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `sorted_x` must be a list containing at least one tuple. At the beginning of the loop, `item` will be the first tuple in `sorted_x`.

State: **`c2` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `sorted_x` contains at least 1 tuple, item is the first tuple in `sorted_x`**
