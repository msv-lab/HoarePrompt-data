Output State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1; `sorted_x` is a list of tuples sorted by values from `dict1`; `ls` remains unchanged; each first element of the tuples in `sorted_x` has been printed `c1` times, where `c1` is the count of that first element in `ls`.**
