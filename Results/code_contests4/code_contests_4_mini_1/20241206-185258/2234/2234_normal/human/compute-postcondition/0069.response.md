According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `sorted_x` list, which must have at least one more tuple for the loop to continue. At the end of the last iteration, `c2` is 0 initially, and if the second element of `item` was equal to 1, then `c2` would be set to 1. If it was not equal to 1, then `c2` remains unchanged. In either case, `sorted_x` still contains at least 2 tuples at the end of the last iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sorted_x` must have at least 2 tuples. If we execute the loop again, the next `item` will be the second tuple in `sorted_x`. 

State: **`c2` is 0, for the loop to execute again `sorted_x` must contain at least 2 tuples, and `item` is the next tuple in `sorted_x`.**
