The value of `c2` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, after execution, `c2` will be 1. The states of the other variables, `sorted_x` and `item`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c2` is 1, `sorted_x` contains at least 2 tuples, `item` is the second tuple in `sorted_x`.

Output State: **`c2` is 1, `sorted_x` contains at least 2 tuples, `item` is the second tuple in `sorted_x**.
