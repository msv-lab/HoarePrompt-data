The variable `ls` is an empty list, and the code appends the value of `a` (which is an input string) to this list. After execution, `ls` will contain one element, which is the input string `a`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and `ls` is now updated with the new element. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is greater than 0, `ls` contains the string `a`, `a` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is greater than 0, `ls` contains the string `a`, `a` is an input string.**
