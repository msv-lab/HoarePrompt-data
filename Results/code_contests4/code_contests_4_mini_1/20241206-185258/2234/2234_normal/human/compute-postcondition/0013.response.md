The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `t` is greater than 1, so after execution, `t` will be one less than its initial value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `ls`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is now one less than its previous value; `ls` is a list containing the string `a` and now includes the new value of `a`; `a` is a new input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is now one less than its previous value; `ls` is a list containing the string `a` and now includes the new value of `a`; `a` is a new input string.**
