The variable `c1` is assigned the value of `ls.count(x[0])`, which counts how many times the first element of the tuple `x` appears in the list `ls`. The value of `c1` will depend on the contents of `ls` and the first element of the tuple `x`. The other variable `c2` and the condition regarding `sorted_x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1; `x` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`; `c1` is the count of `x[0]` in `ls`.

Output State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1; `x` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`; `c1` is the count of `x[0]` in `ls`.**
