Postcondition: ***`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `sorted_x` is the list of tuples sorted by values from `dict1`, and `dict1` is a dictionary where each key is a substring from `ls` and each value is the count of how many strings in `ls` contain that key as a substring. If `c2` is greater than 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `ls` remains unchanged, and each first element of the tuples in `sorted_x` has been printed `c1` times, where `c1` is the count of that first element in `ls`.***
