According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c1`. The loop will execute if `c1` is greater than 0, as the range will be from 0 to `c1 - 1`. If `c1` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute at all. 

Given that `c1` is the count of `x[0]` in `ls`, it must be at least 1 for the loop to run. If `c1` is greater than 0, then `z` will be defined and will start from 0. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need `c1` to be greater than 0, meaning `z` is 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `x` is the second tuple in `sorted_x`, `c1` is greater than 0, `z` is 0**
