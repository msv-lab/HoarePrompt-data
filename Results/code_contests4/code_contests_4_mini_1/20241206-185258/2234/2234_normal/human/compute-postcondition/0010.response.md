According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, which means `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. There are no other states that need to be adjusted since `n` and `ls` are not relevant to the loop's continuation.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is greater than 1; `ls` is a list containing the string `a` and now also includes the new value of `a`**
