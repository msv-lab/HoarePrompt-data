The variable `c1` is assigned the value of the count of `x[0]` in the list `ls`. The value of `x[0]` is not specified, but it is derived from the second tuple in `sorted_x`, and `ls` is a list. The impact of this line is that `c1` will now hold the number of occurrences of `x[0]` in `ls`. The variable `z` could potentially be affected because it depends on the value of `c1`, but we do not change `z` in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is determined by the counting operation.

Output State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1; `x` is the second tuple in `sorted_x`; `c1` is now the count of `x[0]` in `ls`; `z` is `c1 - 1` if `c1` is greater than 0, otherwise `z` does not exist.**
