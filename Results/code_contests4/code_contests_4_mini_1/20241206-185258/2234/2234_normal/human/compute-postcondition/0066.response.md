According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `sorted_x` list. If `sorted_x` contains tuples, the loop will run once for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `sorted_x` contains at least 1 tuple, and `item` is the first tuple in that list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `sorted_x` must contain at least 2 tuples. Since `item` is currently the first tuple, for the next iteration, `item` will be the second tuple in `sorted_x`.

State: **`c2` is 0, `sorted_x` contains at least 2 tuples, and `item` is the second tuple in `sorted_x`.**
