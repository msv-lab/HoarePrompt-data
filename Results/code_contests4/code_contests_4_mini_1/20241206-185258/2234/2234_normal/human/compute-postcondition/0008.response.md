`ls` is updated by appending the value of `a`, which is an input string. The previous state of `ls` was a list containing the string `a`. The variable `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1; `ls` is a list containing the string `a` and now also includes the new value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1; `ls` is a list containing the string `a` and now also includes the new value of `a`.**
