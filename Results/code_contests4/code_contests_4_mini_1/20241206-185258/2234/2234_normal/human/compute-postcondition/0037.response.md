The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of other variables (`ls` and `z`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is now 2, `ls` is a list with at least 2 elements, `z` is the second element in the list.

Output State: **`count` is now 2, `ls` is a list with at least 2 elements, `z` is the second element in the list**
