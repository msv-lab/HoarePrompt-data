Postcondition: ***`c2` is 0 initially, if the second element of `item` (which is the second tuple in `sorted_x`) is equal to 1, then `c2` is set to 1 and `sorted_x` still contains at least 2 tuples. If the second element of `item` is not equal to 1, the values of `c2` and `sorted_x` remain unchanged.***
