The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it processes input values based on the constraints provided. It expects an integer `n`, which must be in the range of 1 to 100. Following this, the function expects `n` strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with each string having a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. The function then produces output based on these inputs, although the specific output is not defined. 

Given these details, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and n strings of lowercase English letters (each string length is from 1 to 100). It processes these inputs to produce output based on them.**
