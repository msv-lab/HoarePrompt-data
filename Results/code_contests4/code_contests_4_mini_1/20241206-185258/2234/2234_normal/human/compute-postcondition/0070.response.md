The value of `c2` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, the new value of `c2` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c2` is 1, `sorted_x` must contain at least 2 tuples, and `item` is the next tuple in `sorted_x`.

Output State: **`c2` is 1, `sorted_x` must contain at least 2 tuples, and `item` is the next tuple in `sorted_x.**
