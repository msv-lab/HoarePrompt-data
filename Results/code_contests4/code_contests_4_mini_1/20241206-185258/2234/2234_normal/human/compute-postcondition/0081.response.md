According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c1`. If `z` is less than `c1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0 and `c1` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. Since `z` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `c1` must be greater than `z`, which will be 1 after this iteration. Therefore, `c1` must be greater than 1.

State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `x` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`, `c1` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, and the first element of `x` is printed.**
