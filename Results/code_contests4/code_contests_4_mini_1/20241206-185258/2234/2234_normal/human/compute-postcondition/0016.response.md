According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ls`. For the loop to execute at least once, `ls` must contain at least 1 input string. Since `t` is 0, it indicates that there are no input strings in `ls`. Therefore, `t` must be adjusted to be at least 1, and `ls` needs to contain at least 1 string. 

So, for the loop to be executed for the first time, `t` should be at least 1, and `ls` should contain at least 1 input string. 

State: **`t` is 1, `ls` contains at least 1 input string, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is the first string in `ls`**
