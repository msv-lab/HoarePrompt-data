The value of `c2` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The values of `sorted_x` and `item` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `c2` is 1, `sorted_x` contains at least 1 tuple, `item` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`, and the second element of `item` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`c2` is 1, `sorted_x` contains at least 1 tuple, `item` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`, and the second element of `item` is equal to 1.**
