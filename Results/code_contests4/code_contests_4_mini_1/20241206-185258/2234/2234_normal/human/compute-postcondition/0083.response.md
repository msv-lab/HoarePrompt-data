According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `z` and `c1`. If `z` is less than `c1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 1, and `c1` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `c1` must be greater than 2.

State: **`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `x` is the first tuple in `sorted_x`, `c1` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, and the first element of `x` is printed.**
