Postcondition: ***`c2` is the count of tuples in `sorted_x` where the second element equals 1, `sorted_x` is the list of tuples sorted by values from `dict1`, and `dict1` is a dictionary where each key is a substring from `ls` and each value is the count of how many strings in `ls` contain that key as a substring. Additionally, `c2` is less than or equal to 1.***
