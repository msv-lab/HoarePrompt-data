To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its potential shortcomings.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to reorder `n` strings such that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings. If such an ordering is not possible, we should output "NO". If it is possible, we should output "YES" followed by the reordered strings.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `n` strings into a list `ls`.

2. **Counting Substring Occurrences**:
   - The program builds a dictionary `dict1` where each string is associated with the count of how many strings it is a substring of.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The strings are sorted in descending order based on how many strings they are substrings of.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if there are more than one strings that are substrings of only one other string (i.e., `c2 > 1`). If so, it prints "NO".

5. **Output**:
   - If the conditions for a valid ordering are met, it prints "YES" and the strings in the derived order.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for determining if a valid order exists seems flawed. The check for `c2 > 1` does not ensure that it is impossible to reorder strings correctly; it merely checks for a specific condition that may not cover all cases.
  
- For instance, consider the following input:
  ```
  4
  abc
  a
  ab
  b
  ```
  - In this case, "a" is a substring of "ab" and "abc", "b" is a substring of "ab", and "ab" is a substring of "abc". The correct order is "a", "b", "ab", "abc", which should output "YES". However, based on the current logic, since it may not correctly count the relationship among all strings, it could inadvertently lead to a "NO" output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not properly handle all cases regarding the substring ordering requirement. Specifically, the logic to determine whether an ordering is impossible is too simplistic and fails for certain combinations of strings. 

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
