To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to reorder `n` strings such that for every string, all strings that are placed before it must be its substrings.
2. If such an arrangement is impossible, we must print "NO".
3. If it is possible, we print "YES" followed by the reordered strings.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program reads `n` strings into a list `ls`.
2. It then creates a dictionary `dict1`, where each string is a key and the value is the count of how many strings from the list contain that key as a substring.
3. The list of items in `dict1` is sorted in descending order based on the count of substrings.
4. It checks if there are more than one string with a count of 1 (meaning these strings do not serve as substrings for any other strings).
5. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the strings in the required order.

### Potential Issues in the Program:
- The sorting mechanism does not guarantee that the order of substrings is correct beyond the count of occurrences. For example, if the strings are "a", "ab", "abc", and "b", the program may incorrectly reorder them based solely on how many strings contain them, rather than ensuring that all strings before a given string are indeed its substrings.
- The check for `c2 > 1` is insufficient. There may be cases where a valid arrangement exists, but the logic incorrectly assumes that multiple strings with a count of 1 indicate a "NO" situation.
- The program does not directly check if the current order of strings satisfies the substring condition for every string against the others in the final output.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
4
abc
ab
a
b
```
- The expected output should be:
```
YES
a
ab
abc
b
```
- However, the program may output "NO" because it only checks the count of strings containing each substring and not the actual arrangement feasibility.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the program does not guarantee that it produces the correct output for all cases, especially when the arrangement of substrings is concerned.

Correctness: **False**
