You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.

String a is a substring of string b if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in b in such a way that they form a. For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of strings.

The next n lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from 1 to 100, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.

Some strings might be equal.

Output

If it is impossible to reorder n given strings in required order, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and n given strings in required order.

Examples

Input

5
a
aba
abacaba
ba
aba


Output

YES
a
ba
aba
aba
abacaba


Input

5
a
abacaba
ba
aba
abab


Output

NO


Input

3
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty


Output

YES
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty

Note

In the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string "abab" is not a substring of the string "abacaba".
Program:
```
t = int(raw_input())
ls = []
while t > 0:
    a = raw_input()
    ls.append(a)
    t = t - 1
dict1 = {}
for x in ls:
    count = 0
    for z in ls:
        if x in z:
            count = count + 1
    dict1[x] = count
sorted_x = sorted(dict1.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))
sorted_x.reverse()
c2 = 0
for item in sorted_x:
    if item[1] == 1:
        c2 = c2 + 1
if c2 > 1:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')
    for x in sorted_x:
        c1 = ls.count(x[0])
        for z in range(c1):
            print(x[0])
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
