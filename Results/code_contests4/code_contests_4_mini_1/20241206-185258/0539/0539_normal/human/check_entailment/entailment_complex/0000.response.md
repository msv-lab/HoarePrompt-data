To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: Two integers, `sum` (target sum) and `limit` (upper limit for distinct integers).
2. **Outputs**:
   - A size `n` of a set `S` of distinct integers from 1 to `limit` such that the sum of their lowbits equals `sum`.
   - If no such set exists, return `-1`.

### Key Requirements:
- The lowbit of a number `x` is defined as the largest power of 2 that divides `x`.
- The elements of the set `S` must be distinct integers within the range `[1, limit]`.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `target` (equivalent to `sum` in the problem description) and `n` (which is actually `limit`).
2. **Tuple Generation**: The program generates tuples of the form `(2^k, i)`, where `k` is derived from the lowbit computation of `i`. The first element represents the contribution to the sum from the integer `i`.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the total possible sum (`s`) from all generated lowbits. If `s < target`, it correctly prints `-1` as no valid set can be formed.
4. **Selection of Indices**: The program sorts the list of tuples and selects indices based on the cumulative sum reaching or exceeding the `target`. It correctly tracks the indices of the selected numbers.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not ensure that the selected integers are within the range of `1` to `limit`. The tuples generated might include powers of two that exceed `limit`, but the selection does not filter based on this condition.
- The loop that generates tuples may not correctly reflect the distinctness of integers from `1` to `limit`, especially when `limit` is small.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to adhere to the requirement that the elements of the set `S` must be distinct integers from `1` to `limit`. Additionally, it does not prevent the selection of indices that represent numbers greater than the specified `limit`. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
