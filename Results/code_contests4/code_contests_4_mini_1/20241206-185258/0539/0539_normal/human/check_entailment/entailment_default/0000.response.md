To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description:

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to find a distinct set of integers from `1` to `limit` such that the sum of the "lowbit" values of these integers equals `sum`. The "lowbit" of an integer `x` is defined as the value of `2^k`, where `k` is the position of the least significant set bit in the binary representation of `x`.

### Code Analysis
The code begins by reading the integers `target` (which corresponds to `sum`) and `n` (which corresponds to `limit`). It initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `s` for the cumulative sum. It then iterates from `1` to `n`, calculating the "lowbit" for each integer `i` and appending the tuple `(lowbit, index)` to the list `A`. After calculating the sum of the "lowbits", if the sum `s` is less than `target`, it prints `-1` and exits.

The code then sorts the list `A` and attempts to select indices whose "lowbit" values cumulatively meet or exceed `target`, printing the count of selected indices and the indices themselves.

### Edge Case Considerations
1. **Handling Cases Where `target` is Greater than Possible Sum**: If `target` is greater than the total sum of "lowbits" from `1` to `limit`, the output `-1` is correct.
2. **Single Element Edge Cases**: If `limit` is `1`, the only possible set is `{1}` which has a lowbit of `1`. If `target` is greater than `1`, it should return `-1`. The code seems to handle this case correctly.
3. **Exact Matching of `target`**: If the sum of lowbits matches exactly with `target`, the program should return all selected indices. This is handled by the loop that breaks when `target` becomes `0`.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints describe:
- The function reads `target` and `n`.
- It calculates powers of two and their indices.
- If the sum of these powers is less than `target`, it returns `-1`.
- It selects indices until the cumulative sum meets or exceeds `target`.

The output hints align well with the operations performed in the code. It accurately reflects how the code is supposed to function.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the code against the problem description and considering edge cases, it is determined that the program does not have any glaring issues that would cause it to fail under the specified conditions. The logic of selecting indices based on their "lowbit" values aligns with the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**.
