To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem requirements and the program behavior step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to find a set \( S \) of distinct integers from 1 to \( \text{limit} \) such that the sum of the lowbits of the selected integers equals \( \text{sum} \).
2. The lowbit of an integer \( x \) is defined as the value of \( 2^k \), where \( k \) is the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of \( x \).

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers, `target` (sum) and `n` (limit).
   
2. **Generating Lowbits**:
   - The program generates tuples in a list \( A \) where each tuple consists of the lowbit value of \( i \) (where \( i \) ranges from 1 to \( n \)) and \( i \) itself.
   - It correctly computes the lowbit using the expression `(i & -i) - 1` and adjusts \( k \) to represent the correct power of two.

3. **Sum Check**:
   - The program calculates the total sum \( s \) of the lowbit values in the list \( A \).
   - If \( s < \text{target} \), it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to achieve the desired sum, which is correct.

4. **Selecting Elements**:
   - The program sorts the list \( A \) and attempts to select elements such that the sum of their lowbits equals the target sum.
   - It decrements the target by the lowbit values of the selected integers and adds the corresponding integers to the `selected` list.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the number of selected integers and the integers themselves.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- The program correctly adheres to the requirement of selecting distinct integers from 1 to \( \text{limit} \).
- It calculates the lowbit values correctly and checks if it can achieve the required sum.
- It properly handles the case where achieving the sum is impossible by returning -1.

### Conclusion:
Based on this analysis, the program follows the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, it is correct for all potential cases defined in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
