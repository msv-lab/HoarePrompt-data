The loop iteratively decreases the `target` by the first element of each tuple in `A` and appends the second element of each tuple to the `selected` list until `target` is less than or equal to 0 or all tuples in `A` have been processed. If `A` is empty, the loop does not execute and `target` remains unchanged. 

After all iterations of the loop have completed, the state will reflect the following:

- `sum`, `limit`, and `target` will have been decreased by the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `A` that were processed until `target` became less than or equal to 0.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `A` is a sorted list of tuples.
- `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`.
- `selected` will contain the second elements of all tuples in `A` that were processed.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` is decreased by the sum of the first elements of processed tuples in `A`; `n` is a positive integer; `A` is a sorted list of tuples; `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`; `selected` contains the second elements of the processed tuples in `A`.**
