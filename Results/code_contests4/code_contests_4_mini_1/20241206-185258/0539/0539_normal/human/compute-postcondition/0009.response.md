The variable `s` is incremented by the first element of the last tuple in the list `A`. Since `A` contains the tuple `(2`, the first element of this tuple is `2`. The previous value of `s` is unknown, so we can only state that it has been increased by `2`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is at least 1; `A` is a list containing the tuple (2; `s` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is at least 1; `A` is a list containing the tuple (2; `s` is increased by 2.**
