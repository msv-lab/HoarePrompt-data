Functionality: ** The function reads two integers from input, `target` and `n`. It calculates a list of tuples where each tuple contains a power of two and its index. If the sum of the first elements of these tuples is less than `target`, it prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, it selects the indices of tuples whose first elements cumulatively meet or exceed `target` and prints the count of selected indices followed by the indices themselves. If the sum is exactly equal to `target`, it will include all tuples, and if `target` is reduced to zero during selection, it stops adding further indices. The function does not take parameters directly but relies on user input for its operation.**
