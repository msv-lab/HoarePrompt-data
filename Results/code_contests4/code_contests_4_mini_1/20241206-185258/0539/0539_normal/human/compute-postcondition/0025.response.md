The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged as no further operations are performed. 

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is a positive integer; `A` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (2^k, i); `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`; `s` is less than `target`; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
