The function `func` accepts two parameters: `sum` and `limit`. Both `sum` and `limit` are integers that satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 10^5. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the specific return value or the conditions under which it returns a value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integer parameters, `sum` and `limit`, both within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `sum` and `limit`, both integers within the range of 1 to 100,000.**
