Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `target` are decreased by `tup[0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `A` is a sorted list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, and `selected` contains an additional instance of `tup[1]`. If `target` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
