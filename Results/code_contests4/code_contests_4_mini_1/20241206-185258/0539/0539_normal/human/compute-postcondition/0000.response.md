`target` and `n` are assigned the values from `raw_input()`, which accepts user input and `map(int, ...)` converts the input values to integers. The variables `sum` and `limit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 10^5; `target` and `n` are input integers.

Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 10^5; `target` and `n` are input integers.**
