The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum`, `limit`, `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`; `n` is a positive integer; `A` is a sorted list of tuples with at least 2 tuples; `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`; `selected` contains `tup[1]` and `tup` is the second tuple in `A`; `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`; `selected` now contains an additional element `tup[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
