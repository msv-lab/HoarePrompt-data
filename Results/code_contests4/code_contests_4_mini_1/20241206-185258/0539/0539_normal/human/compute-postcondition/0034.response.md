Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`; `n` is a positive integer; `A` is a sorted list of tuples; `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`; `selected` now contains `tup[1]`; `tup` is the first tuple in `A`. If `target` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
