The code `target -= tup[0]` modifies the value of `target` by subtracting the first element of the tuple `tup` from it. The previous value of `tup` is the first tuple in the sorted list `A`, and since `A` contains at least one tuple, `tup[0]` will have a defined integer value. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `A` is a sorted list of tuples, `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`, `selected` is an empty list, `tup` is the first tuple in `A`**.
