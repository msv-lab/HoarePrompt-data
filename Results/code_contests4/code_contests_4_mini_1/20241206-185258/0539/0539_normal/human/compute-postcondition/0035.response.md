According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `A`. If `A` contains more tuples, the loop can execute again for the next tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is the first tuple in `A` and `selected` now contains `tup[1]`. Since `tup` is the first tuple, for the loop to execute one more time, `A` must contain at least 2 tuples, and `tup` would be updated to the second tuple in `A`. 

State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`; `n` is a positive integer; `A` is a sorted list of tuples with at least 2 tuples; `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`; `selected` contains `tup[1]`; `tup` is the second tuple in `A`.**
