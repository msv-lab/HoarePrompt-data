The variable `A` contains a tuple with a single element, which is `(2)`. The expression `A[-1]` accesses the last element of `A`, which is the tuple itself. Then, `A[-1][0]` retrieves the first element of the tuple, which is `2`. The variable `s` is incremented by this retrieved value. However, the initial value of `s` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only determine that `s` is increased by `2`, and the exact new value of `s` cannot be specified.

Output State: **`A` contains (2); `s` is increased by 2**
