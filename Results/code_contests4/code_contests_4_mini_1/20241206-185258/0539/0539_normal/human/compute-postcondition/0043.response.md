The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is decreased by `tup[0]`, `limit` is decreased by `tup[0]`, `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `A` is a sorted list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, and `selected` now contains an additional instance of `tup[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
