The variable `selected` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, `A`, or `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is a positive integer; `A` is a sorted list of tuples; `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`; `selected` is an empty list.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is a positive integer; `A` is a sorted list of tuples; `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`; `selected` is an empty list.**
