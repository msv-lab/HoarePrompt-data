The variable `target` is decreased by the value of `tup[0]`. The initial state indicates that `tup` is the third tuple in `A`, and `tup[1]` is contained in `selected`, but we don't have specific values for `tup[0]` or `target`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `target`, but we can state that it has been modified. 

The output state reflects the change in `target`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is decreased by `tup[0]`, `limit` is decreased by `tup[0]`, `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `A` is a sorted list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `selected` contains `tup[1]`, and `tup` is the third tuple in `A`.**
