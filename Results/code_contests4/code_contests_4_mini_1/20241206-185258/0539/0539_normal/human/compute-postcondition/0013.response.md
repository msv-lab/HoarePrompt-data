Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is at least 1; `A` is a list containing the tuple (2); `s` is increased by 2; `i` is at least 2; if `i` is not equal to 1 and `k` is at least 1 (determined by `int(math.log(i, 2))`), then `k` is determined by the expression `(i & -i) - 1`.***
