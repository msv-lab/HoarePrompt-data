According to the code, the loop will execute again for the next tuple in the sorted list `A`. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is the second tuple in `A`, which means that the loop has already processed the first tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to process the third tuple in the list `A`. 

The states that need to be adjusted are as follows: 
- The variable `tup` must be updated to refer to the third tuple in `A`.
- `selected` will contain the element `tup[1]` from the third tuple.
- The loop will continue as long as there are more tuples in `A` to process.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `A` has at least 2 tuples, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, it needs to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target` are decreased by `tup[0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `A` is a sorted list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `selected` contains `tup[1]` and `tup` is the third tuple in `A`.**
