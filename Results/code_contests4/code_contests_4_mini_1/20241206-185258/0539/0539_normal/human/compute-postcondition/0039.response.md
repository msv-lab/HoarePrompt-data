Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `target` are decreased by `tup[0]`. `n` is a positive integer. `A` is a sorted list of tuples with at least 2 tuples. `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`. `selected` contains `tup[1]` and `tup` is the second tuple in `A`. If `target` is less than or equal to 0, `target` is decreased by `tup[0]`, `selected` now contains an additional element `tup[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
