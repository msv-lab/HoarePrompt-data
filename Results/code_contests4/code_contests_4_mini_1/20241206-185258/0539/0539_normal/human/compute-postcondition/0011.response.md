The value of `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is at least 1, which means `i` is at least 2. The expression `(i & -i)` computes the bitwise AND of `i` and its two's complement, yielding the least significant bit that is set in `i`. Subtracting `1` from this result gives `k`. The exact value of `k` depends on the specific value of `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is at least 1; `A` is a list containing the tuple (2); `s` is increased by 2; `i` is at least 2; `k` is determined by the expression `(i & -i) - 1`.
