According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its value from the previous iteration, and we need to determine if it can execute again.

Given that at the end of the last iteration, `A` contains (2) and `s` has been increased by 2, we need to consider the value of `i` at this point. The loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and increments `i` by 1 each time until it reaches `n + 1`.

To execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. If `i` was at its maximum value before this iteration, it would have been `n`. Thus, to execute the loop again, `i` must now be `n + 1`, indicating the loop is about to terminate.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 for each iteration, if `i` is currently `n`, it will be increased to `n + 1` for the next iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` is now `n + 1` and that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`.

State: **`A` contains (2); `s` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute a next time `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` and `i` is `n + 1`**
