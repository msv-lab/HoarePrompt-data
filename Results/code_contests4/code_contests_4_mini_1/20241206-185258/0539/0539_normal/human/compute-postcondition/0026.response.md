Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `target` are integers; `n` is a positive integer; `A` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (2^k, i); `s` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A`. If `s` is less than `target`, -1 is printed and the program exits. If `s` is greater than or equal to `target`, the program continues executing beyond this point.***
