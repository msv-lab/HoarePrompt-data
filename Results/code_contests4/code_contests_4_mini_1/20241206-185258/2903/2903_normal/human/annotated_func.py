#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is an integer representing the width of the river (1 ≤ w ≤ 100000), l is an integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump (1 ≤ l < w), and a is a list of integers of length w-1 where each a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10000) represents the number of stones at distance i from the bank.
def func():
    n, k, s, mn = map(int, raw_input().split() + [0, 10000000000])
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if i < k:
            s += a[i]
        else:
            mn = min(mn, s)
            s += a[i] - a[i - k]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `mn` is the minimum of 10000000000 and the value of `s` after processing the last `n - 1` elements of the list `a`, `s` is the sum of the last `k` elements processed in the loop, and `i` is `n - 1`.
    print(min(mn, s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of distances, an integer `k` representing the maximum length of the frog's jump, and a list `a` of integers indicating the number of stones at each distance from the bank. It calculates the minimum sum of stones that can be collected from any `k` consecutive distances as the frog attempts to cross the river. The function returns the minimum stones collected from the last `k` distances processed or the initial maximum value, effectively determining the least number of stones in the last segment of jumps. It does not explicitly check if the frog can successfully cross the river, as implied in the annotations.
