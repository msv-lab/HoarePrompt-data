The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of distances, an integer `k` representing the maximum length of the frog's jump, and a list `a` of integers indicating the number of stones at each distance from the bank. It calculates the minimum sum of stones that can be collected from any `k` consecutive distances as the frog attempts to cross the river. The function returns the minimum stones collected from the last `k` distances processed or the initial maximum value, effectively determining the least number of stones in the last segment of jumps. It does not explicitly check if the frog can successfully cross the river, as implied in the annotations.
