The function `func` accepts three parameters: `w`, `l`, and `a`. Here, `w` is an integer representing the width of the river, constrained such that \(1 \leq w \leq 100000\). The parameter `l` is an integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump, constrained by \(1 \leq l < w\). The parameter `a` is a list of integers with length \(w-1\), where each element \(a_i\) (for \(0 \leq i < w-1\)) represents the number of stones at distance \(i\) from the bank, constrained such that \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10000\).

The function will analyze the parameters and will return a value based on the frog's ability to cross the river using the stones. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters w (integer), l (integer), and a (list of integers), and returns whether the frog can successfully cross the river based on the number of stones and the maximum jump length.**
