The value of `s` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. The initial state does not provide the value of `a`, but since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is a valid index for the array `a`. The value of `s` is updated based on the current value of `a[2]`. The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, and `s` is increased by `a[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, and `s` is increased by `a[2]**.
