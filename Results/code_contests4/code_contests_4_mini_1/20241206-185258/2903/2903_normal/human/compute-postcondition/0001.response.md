The variable `a` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which means it will hold a list of integers based on the input provided by the user. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` remain unchanged, as the code only affects `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `mn` is 10000000000, and `a` is a list of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `mn` is 10000000000, `a` is a list of integers based on user input**.
