The variable `s` is updated by adding the difference of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]` to its current value. The previous value of `s` is dependent on conditions within the loop, and `i` is currently 1. The variable `a` is an array whose specific values are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact change to `s`. The minimum value `mn` is also updated based on the new value of `s`, but without the exact values of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`, we cannot specify the final value of `s` or how it affects `mn`.

Therefore, the output state is that `s` is updated, but its value cannot be determined without additional information about the array `a`. The value of `mn` is also updated based on this change, but again, we cannot specify its exact value.

Output State: **`s` is updated by adding the difference of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`, and `mn` takes the minimum between its previous value and the new value of `s`.**
