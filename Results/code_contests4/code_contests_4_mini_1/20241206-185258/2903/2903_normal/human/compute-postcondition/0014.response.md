According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Thus, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. To ensure that the loop executes again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, since `n - 1` must be greater than `i` (which will be 2).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2**
