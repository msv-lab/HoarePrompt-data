The code assigns values to the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` using the `map` function and `raw_input()`. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers, which is then split and converted into integers. The last two values assigned to `mn` are `0` and `10000000000`, respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, and `s` will depend on the user input, while `mn` will always be `10000000000`.

Assuming `n`, `k`, and `s` are taken from the input and can be any integers consistent with the constraints, the output state will be represented as:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `mn` is 10000000000**.
