Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `k` is an input integer. If `i` is less than `k`, then `s` is increased by `a[i]`. Otherwise, `s` is updated, and `mn` takes the value of the minimum between 10000000000 and `s`, with `a` being a list of integers based on user input.***
