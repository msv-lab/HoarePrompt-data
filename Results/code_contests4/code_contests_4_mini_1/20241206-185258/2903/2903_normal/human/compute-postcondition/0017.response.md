The value of `s` is incremented by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`. The values of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]` are not specified, but `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `s` is increased by `a[2] - a[2 - k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `s` is increased by `a[2] - a[2 - k]**
