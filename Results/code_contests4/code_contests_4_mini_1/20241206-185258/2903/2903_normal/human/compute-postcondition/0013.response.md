Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 1. If `i` is less than `k`, `s` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, and `mn` takes the minimum between 10000000000 and the updated value of `s`, which is increased by `a[i]`. Otherwise, `s` is updated by adding the difference of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`, and `mn` takes the minimum between its previous value and the new value of `s`.***
