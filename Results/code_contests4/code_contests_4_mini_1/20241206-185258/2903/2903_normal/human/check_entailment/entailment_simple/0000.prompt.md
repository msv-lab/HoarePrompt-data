You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A lot of frogs want to cross a river. A river is w units width, but frogs can only jump l units long, where l < w. Frogs can also jump on lengths shorter than l. but can't jump longer. Hopefully, there are some stones in the river to help them.

The stones are located at integer distances from the banks. There are a_i stones at the distance of i units from the bank the frogs are currently at. Each stone can only be used once by one frog, after that it drowns in the water.

What is the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river, given that then can only jump on the stones?

Input

The first line contains two integers w and l (1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5) — the width of the river and the maximum length of a frog's jump.

The second line contains w - 1 integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{w-1} (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), where a_i is the number of stones at the distance i from the bank the frogs are currently at.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river.

Examples

Input

10 5
0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0


Output

3


Input

10 3
1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1


Output

3

Note

In the first sample two frogs can use the different stones at the distance 5, and one frog can use the stones at the distances 3 and then 8.

In the second sample although there are two stones at the distance 5, that does not help. The three paths are: 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 10, 0 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 10, 0 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 10.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is an integer representing the width of the river (1 ≤ w ≤ 100000), l is an integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump (1 ≤ l < w), and a is a list of integers of length w-1 where each a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10000) represents the number of stones at distance i from the bank.
def func():
    n, k, s, mn = map(int, raw_input().split() + [0, 10000000000])
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if i < k:
            s += a[i]
        else:
            mn = min(mn, s)
            s += a[i] - a[i - k]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `mn` is the minimum of 10000000000 and the value of `s` after processing the last `n - 1` elements of the list `a`, `s` is the sum of the last `k` elements processed in the loop, and `i` is `n - 1`.
    print(min(mn, s))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
