Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read inputs, which is not appropriate in Python 3, where `input()` should be used. This would cause a runtime error if the program is executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Variable Names**: The variables `n`, `k`, and `s` do not align with the variables defined in the problem description. Specifically, `n` should represent the width of the river (`w`), `k` should represent the maximum jump length (`l`), and `s` is used inconsistently, representing a running sum instead of the total number of frogs that can cross.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic in the loop does not correctly model the problem of frogs jumping across stones. The problem requires determining how many frogs can cross the river based on the availability of stones along the distances, but the program instead calculates a minimum of stones collected over consecutive distances. This does not correlate with the maximum number of frogs that can make it across, as it does not account for the stones available at each specific distance relative to the frogs' jumping capability.

4. **Output Interpretation**: The goal is to return the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river, but the function prints the minimum of stones from the last `k` distances, which does not relate to the number of frogs successfully crossing.

For example, consider the input:
```
10 5
0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0
```
The expected output is `3`, indicating three frogs can cross using the available stones. However, the logic in the provided program does not consider the optimal paths or the ability of frogs to use stones sequentially, leading to incorrect results.

In summary, the program fails to correctly implement the logic necessary to solve the problem as described, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct.
