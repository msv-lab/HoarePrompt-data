To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

The problem description specifies that we need to compare two very long integers a and b, which may have leading zeroes, and output whether a < b, a > b, or a = b.

### Examination of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read the two integers, which is appropriate for Python 2.
   
2. **Leading Zero Handling**:
   - The program correctly removes leading zeroes from both numbers using two while loops:
     ```python
     while i < allen and a[i] == '0':
         i += 1
     while j < bllen and b[j] == '0':
         j += 1
     ```
   - After removing leading zeroes, it calculates the new lengths (`alen` and `blen`).

3. **Length Comparison**:
   - The program compares the lengths of the two processed strings (`alen` and `blen`). If one is longer than the other, it determines the larger number appropriately.

4. **Character-by-Character Comparison**:
   - If the lengths are equal, the program enters a loop to compare characters one by one to determine which number is greater, returning the appropriate symbol.

5. **Equality Check**:
   - If all characters are equal, it returns '='.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Input with All Zeroes**: If both inputs are "00000", the output should be '='. The current implementation would handle this correctly.
- **Input with Different Leading Zeroes**: For example, "000123" and "123". After removing leading zeroes, both should compare equal, and the output should be '='.
- **Single Digit Comparisons**: Inputs like "0" and "0000" should return '='. This is handled correctly.
- **Very Large Numbers**: The logic is sound for comparing lengths and characters, so it should work for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle the problem as described without missing any logic or edge cases. All potential scenarios based on the problem description and examples provided are covered. 

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
