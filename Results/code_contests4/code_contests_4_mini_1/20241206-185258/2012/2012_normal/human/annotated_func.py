#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed, each containing no more than 10^6 characters, and i and j are integers representing the lengths of a and b respectively.
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    if (alen > blen) :
        return '>'
        #The program returns '>' indicating that string 'a' is greater than string 'b' based on their lengths, as the length of 'a' is greater than the length of 'b'.
    else :
        if (alen < blen) :
            return '<'
            #The program returns the string '<' indicating that the string representation of the non-negative integer `a` is less than that of `b`.
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed, each containing no more than 10^6 characters. `i` and `j` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed, each containing no more than 10^6 characters. `i` and `j` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`.
    while i < allen and j < bllen:
        if a[i] < b[j]:
            return '<'
        elif a[i] > b[j]:
            return '>'
        
        i += 1
        
        j += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `allen`, `j` is equal to `bllen`, `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed. If no return statement was executed, `a` and `b` are equal.
    return '='
    #The program returns '=' indicating that the strings 'a' and 'b' are equal.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two string parameters `a` and `b`, which represent non-negative integers and may include leading zeroes, alongside two integers `i` and `j` that represent their lengths. It compares the two strings first by their lengths, returning '>' if `a` is longer, '<' if `b` is longer, and then compares them lexicographically character by character until a difference is found or until they are exhausted. If no difference is found, the function returns '=' indicating that both strings are equal. The function does not handle cases where `i` or `j` are initialized or passed incorrectly, nor does it account for invalid input types.
