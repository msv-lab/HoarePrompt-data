The provided program is expected to compare two very large integers represented as strings. It handles leading zeros and determines whether one number is greater than, less than, or equal to the other.

Upon initial inspection, the code has a few issues:

1. The function `func_1` is defined after its first invocation, which leads to an error. The code attempts to call `func_1` before it has been defined, which will result in a `NameError`.
2. The second invocation of `raw_input()` for reading `a` and `b` is unnecessary and does not fit the problem description, which expects only two lines of input.
3. The variable `alen` and `blen` are calculated after the first call to `func_1`, which will lead to incorrect behavior for the second call.

The output hints state that the function compares the lengths of the two strings first, followed by a character-by-character comparison. However, given the issues outlined above, the function will not work correctly for the provided problem description.

Additionally, the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where `i` or `j` are initialized or passed incorrectly. This is pertinent given that the current implementation does not check if the strings being compared are empty after leading zeros are stripped, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Considering these points, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description due to the structural issues and potential logic flaws.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not work correctly due to the premature definition of `func_1`, unnecessary repeated input reading, and potential issues with leading zero handling that could lead to errors.
