The function accepts two string parameters `a` and `b`, which represent non-negative integers and may include leading zeroes, alongside two integers `i` and `j` that represent their lengths. It compares the two strings first by their lengths, returning '>' if `a` is longer, '<' if `b` is longer, and then compares them lexicographically character by character until a difference is found or until they are exhausted. If no difference is found, the function returns '=' indicating that both strings are equal. The function does not handle cases where `i` or `j` are initialized or passed incorrectly, nor does it account for invalid input types.
