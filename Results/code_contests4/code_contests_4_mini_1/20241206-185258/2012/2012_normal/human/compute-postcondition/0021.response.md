The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, while `i` remains unchanged as it was only stated to be increased by 1 prior to this code. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `i` is increased by 1, and variable `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1, variable `j` is increased by 1**
