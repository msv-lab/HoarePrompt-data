The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`i`, `allen`, and `bllen`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `j` is increased by 1**
