To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the conditions of the while loop. The loop will continue executing as long as both `i` is less than `allen` and `j` is less than `bllen`.

Given the state right before the while loop indicates that:
- `i` is an integer representing the length of string `a`.
- `j` is an integer representing the length of string `b`.
- The lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, meaning `allen` must equal `bllen`.

For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions `i < allen` and `j < bllen` must be satisfied. 

- Since `allen` is equal to `bllen`, we can denote it as `length`.
- Therefore, we require `i < length` and `j < length` for the loop to execute.

To ensure this, we consider that `i` and `j` should both be less than `length`. 

If `i` is equal to or greater than `length`, we need to adjust it to be less than `length`. Similarly, if `j` is equal to or greater than `length`, we need to adjust it to be less than `length`.

Assuming the worst-case scenario where both `i` and `j` are equal to `length` (the lengths of `a` and `b`), we could adjust `i` and `j` as follows:

- Set `i` to `length - 1` (making it less than `length`).
- Set `j` to `length - 1` (making it less than `length` as well).

Finally, the modified state before the loop can be expressed as:

State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed, `i` is `length - 1`, `j` is `length - 1`, where length is the length of both strings**
