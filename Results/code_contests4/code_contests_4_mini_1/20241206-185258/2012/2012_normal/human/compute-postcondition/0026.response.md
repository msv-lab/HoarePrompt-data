Postcondition: ***If `a[i]` is less than `b[j]`, the function returns the string '<'. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are both increased by 1, and if `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]`, the function returns the string '>', indicating that the loop can execute again if `allen` is greater than `i + 1` and `bllen` is greater than `j + 1.***
