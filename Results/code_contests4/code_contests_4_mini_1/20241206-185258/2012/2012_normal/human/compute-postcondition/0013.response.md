The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is `length - 1`. Therefore, after the execution, `i` becomes `length`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unaffected. Consequently, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed, `i` is `length`, `j` is `length - 1`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed, `i` is `length`, `j` is `length - 1**
