Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed, `i` is `length - 1`, `j` is `length - 1`, where length is the length of both strings. The character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, and the character at index `i` of `a` is less than or equal to the character at index `j` of `b`.***
