The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. The parameters `a` and `b` are strings that represent non-negative integers with leading zeros allowed and can each contain no more than \(10^6\) characters. The parameters `i` and `j` are integers that represent the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.

After executing the function body, the function may return different values based on the following cases:

- Case 1: The function returns '>' if the length of string `a` is greater than that of string `b`.
- Case 2: The function returns '<' if the string representation of the non-negative integer `a` is less than that of `b` based on their values.
- Case 3: The function returns '<' if the character at index `i` of string `a` is less than the character at index `j` of string `b`.
- Case 4: The function returns '>' if the character at index `i` of string `a` is greater than the character at index `j` of string `b`.
- Case 5: The function returns '<' in a specific condition.
- Case 6: The function returns '>' in a specific condition.
- Case 7: The function returns '<' in a specific condition.
- Case 8: The function returns '>' if certain conditions for a loop to execute again are satisfied.
- Case 9: The function returns '=' if the strings `a` and `b` are equal.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to compare two string representations of non-negative integers and return a comparison result based on their lengths, values, or specific characters at given indices.

Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters `a` and `b` representing non-negative integers, and two integer parameters `i` and `j` representing their lengths, returning comparison results based on the lengths and values of the strings or specific character comparisons.**
