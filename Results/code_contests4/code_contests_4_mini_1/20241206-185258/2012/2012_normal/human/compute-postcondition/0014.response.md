The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is `length - 1`. Therefore, after execution, `j` will be `length`. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with leading zeroes allowed, `i` is `length`, `j` is `length`**
