Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where both numbers `a` and `b` consist only of leading zeroes. For example, if both inputs are "0000" and "0000", the program would incorrectly compare the lengths of the stripped numbers, which would both be zero, and then incorrectly assume they are equal. However, it does not account for the fact that both inputs are equal after removing the leading zeroes. 

Additionally, if both `a` and `b` are "00000", the program will not reach the part of the code that checks the characters beyond the leading zeroes, thus failing to return the correct equality symbol "=".

This means the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in this specific edge case.
