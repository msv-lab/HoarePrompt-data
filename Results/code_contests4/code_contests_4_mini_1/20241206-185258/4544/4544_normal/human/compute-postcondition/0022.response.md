Functionality: ** The function accepts a `readline` parameter that is used to read input values for a number of participants, each represented by a distinct integer `a` (participant number) and an integer `v` (number of fish caught). It determines the participant who caught the maximum number of fish. If multiple participants caught the same maximum number of fish, it returns the participant with the smallest participant number. If no valid input is provided (e.g., if the loop does not execute), it defaults to `number` as maxsize and `value` as -1, indicating no valid participants were processed. The function prints the participant number and their corresponding catch value, and then exits. **
