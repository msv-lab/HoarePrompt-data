According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(readline())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(readline())` must return a positive integer. Since `value` is -1 and `number` is set to a large positive integer, the value of `value` does not affect the loop execution directly. The key factor is the output of `readline()`.

To ensure that the loop will execute, `readline()` must provide a valid string representation of a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input from `readline()` should yield a positive integer.

State: **`value` is -1, `number` is maxsize, for the loop to execute the first time `int(readline())` must be a positive integer**
