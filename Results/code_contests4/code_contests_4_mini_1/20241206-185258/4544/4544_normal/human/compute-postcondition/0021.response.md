The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `readline`, which is expected to provide input related to the number of participants and their associated fish caught. The parameter `n` is an integer constrained to the range 1 to 20, representing the number of participants. Each participant is associated with a distinct integer number `ai` in the range from 1 to `n`, and a non-negative integer `vi` that indicates the number of fish caught, constrained between 0 and 100.

The function processes this input and returns the participant(s) who caught the maximum number of fish. If multiple participants caught the same maximum number of fish, it returns all of their identifiers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter readline that provides input for the number of participants and their fish caught, and returns the participant(s) who caught the maximum number of fish.**
