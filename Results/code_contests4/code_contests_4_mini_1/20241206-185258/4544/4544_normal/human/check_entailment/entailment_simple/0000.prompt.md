You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A smelt fishing tournament was held at Lake Hibara. The winner is the one who wins the most smelt.

Create a program that reads the list of participant numbers and the number of fish caught and outputs the number of winners and the number of fish caught. If there are multiple winners, output the one with the lowest participant number.



input

The input is given in the following format.


n
a1 v1
a2 v2
::
an vn


n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) represents the number of participants and ai represents the participant number. Participant numbers are different integers between 1 and n. vi (0 ≤ vi ≤ 100) is the number of animals acquired by the participant ai.

output

Output the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught on one line separated by blanks.

Example

Input

6
1 14
2 25
3 42
4 11
5 40
6 37


Output

3 42
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and each participant number ai is a distinct integer between 1 and n with an associated number of fish caught vi, where 0 <= vi <= 100.
def func_1(readline):
    value = -1
    number = maxsize
    for _ in range(int(readline())):
        a, v = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
        
        if v > value or v == value and a < number:
            number = a
            value = v
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `value` is the maximum `v` encountered during the loop iterations, `number` is the corresponding `a` for that maximum `v`, `a` and `v` are the last positive integers read from input if the loop executed, otherwise `value` is -1 and `number` is maxsize.
    print(number, value)
    exit()

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
