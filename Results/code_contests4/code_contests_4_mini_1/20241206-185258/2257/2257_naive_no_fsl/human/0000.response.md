Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimum and maximum possible sums due to an issue in the way it accumulates values for `mini` and `maxi`. Specifically, the line calculating `mini` uses `cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]`, which is incorrect because it pairs the smallest prices with the counts of the most frequently bought items, rather than pairing the smallest prices with the least frequently bought items. 

To illustrate this with a counterexample, consider the following input:

```
5 4
1 5 10 20 30
apple
apple
banana
banana
```

Here, Valera is buying 2 apples and 2 bananas. The counts of fruits in Valera's list would be `{apple: 2, banana: 2}`, meaning he has two of each kind. The correct minimum sum should be achieved by pairing the lowest prices with the fruits he buys most frequently. The sorted price list is `[1, 5, 10, 20, 30]`, and he should take the two lowest prices (1 and 5) for apples, and the next two lowest prices (10 and 20) for bananas, giving a minimum of `1*2 + 10*2 = 22`.

For the maximum sum, he would want the highest prices for the fruits he buys the most of, resulting in a maximum of `30*2 + 20*2 = 100`.

However, the program would incorrectly compute the sums due to the aforementioned logic errors, leading to wrong outputs. Thus, the program is deemed incorrect.
