To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's first analyze the code relative to the specifications given.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads two integers `n` (number of price tags) and `m` (number of fruit purchases).
2. It then reads a list of `n` positive integers representing the prices of the fruits and sorts them.
3. The program uses a dictionary to count how many times each fruit appears in the purchase list.
4. It creates a sorted list of these counts to determine how many of each fruit Valera wants to buy.
5. The program calculates:
   - `maxi`: the maximum possible cost by multiplying the highest prices with the highest counts of fruits.
   - `mini`: the minimum possible cost by multiplying the lowest prices with the highest counts of fruits.
6. Finally, it prints both `mini` and `maxi`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the expected constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), but it does not explicitly handle cases where `m` is zero, which is outside the constraints provided in the problem description. However, since the problem guarantees that Valera will have fruits to buy, this scenario should not occur.
- The program assumes that the input will always be valid based on the constraints mentioned.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints provide a summary of the program's functionality:
- It agrees that the program calculates `mini` and `maxi` based on the counts of fruits and their respective prices.
- The hint points out that the function does not handle cases where `m` is zero or if no fruits are purchased, but again, the problem description guarantees that the number of distinct fruits from the list does not exceed `n`, implying that there will always be fruits to purchase.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum and maximum possible total prices Valera may need to spend on his fruits. Given the constraints and the problem description, it seems to handle all expected cases correctly.

Thus, I cannot find an example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be deemed valid.

Correctness: **True**.
