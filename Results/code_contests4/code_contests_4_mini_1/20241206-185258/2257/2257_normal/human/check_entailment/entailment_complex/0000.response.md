The program provided correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's the reasoning for its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the number of price tags and the number of fruits Valera wants to buy, respectively. It adheres to the constraints given (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

2. **Price Collection**: The program collects the prices of the fruits and sorts them. This is necessary for calculating the minimum and maximum possible total prices. The prices are ensured to be positive integers that do not exceed 100, as specified.

3. **Fruit Count**: The program constructs a dictionary `buy` that counts how many times each fruit appears in Valera's list. This aligns with the requirement to account for multiple entries of the same fruit.

4. **Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Prices**:
   - The program sorts the counts of fruits in `counts`, which allows it to pair the least expensive prices with the most frequently bought fruits for the minimum price calculation.
   - For the maximum price, it pairs the most expensive prices with the most frequently bought fruits, which is also handled correctly by iterating in reverse through the sorted prices.

5. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, showing the minimum price followed by the maximum price.

The program does not have any logical flaws and handles the described input and output correctly, as it calculates the minimum and maximum possible sums based on the distribution of prices to the fruits.

Thus, the program meets all the criteria laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
