The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since the inputs are likely provided through other means, possibly through global variables or user input within the function. However, it operates under certain constraints: `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers, each not exceeding 100; and the subsequent `m` lines contain non-empty strings representing fruit names, each with a length not exceeding 32, with the number of distinct fruit names being less than or equal to `n`.

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed in the provided information. Therefore, we will summarize based on the constraints and expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function operates with integer parameters n and m, a list of positive integers prices, and multiple strings representing fruit names, and it is expected to process these inputs accordingly, though the specific output behavior is not defined.**
