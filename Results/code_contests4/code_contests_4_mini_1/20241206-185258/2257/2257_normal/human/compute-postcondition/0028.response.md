Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the number of fruit prices and the number of fruit purchases, respectively. It reads a list of `n` positive integers as prices and `m` fruit names from user input. It calculates two sums: `mini`, which is the minimum total cost based on the lowest prices and the count of each fruit purchased, and `maxi`, which is the maximum total cost based on the highest prices and the count of each fruit purchased. Finally, it prints both `mini` and `maxi`. The function does not handle cases where `m` is zero or if no fruits are purchased, and it assumes valid input based on the constraints provided.**
