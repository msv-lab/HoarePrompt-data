Output State: **`n` is an integer value from the input, `m` is greater than 1, `cs` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `buy` has been updated with the key `nf`, `i` is 2, `nf` is updated with a string input from raw_input(), and `buy[nf]` is incremented by 1 (or initialized to 1 if it did not exist); for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 2.**
