The code initializes an empty dictionary `buy`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `cs` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `cs` is a sorted list of integers from user input, and `buy` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `cs` is a sorted list of integers from user input, and `buy` is an empty dictionary.**
