According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n2`. If `i` is less than `n2`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n2` is greater than 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n2` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s1` is equal to the sum of the last `n1` elements of the sorted list `a`; `n1` is the number of elements summed; `s2` is updated to be the previous value of `s2` plus `a[n - n1 - 2]`; `n` is greater than or equal to `n1`; `n2` is greater than 2; `i` is 2**
