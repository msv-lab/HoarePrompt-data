The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The integer values for `n`, `n1`, and `n2` remain unchanged as the sorting operation only affects the list `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are assigned integer values from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers.

Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are assigned integer values from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers.**
