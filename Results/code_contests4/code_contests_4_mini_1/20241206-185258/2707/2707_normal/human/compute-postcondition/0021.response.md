Output State: **`s1` is equal to the sum of the last `n1` elements of the sorted list `a`; `n1` is the number of elements summed; `n` is greater than or equal to `n1`; `s2` is equal to the sum of the last `n2` elements of the sorted list `a` starting from index `n - n1 - 1`; `n2` is the number of iterations completed; `i` is equal to `n2 - 1` after the loop completes.**
