The loop iterates `n1` times, and during each iteration, it adds the element from the sorted list `a` at the index `n - i - 1` to the variable `s1`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `s1` will contain the sum of the last `n1` elements from the sorted list `a`. 

If `n1` is greater than `n`, it implies the loop won't execute and `s1` will remain 0. However, if `n1` is less than or equal to `n`, then `s1` will hold the sum of the last `n1` elements from `a`, and `i` will be equal to `n1 - 1` at the conclusion of the loop.

Output State: **`s1` is equal to the sum of the last `n1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `n1` is the number of elements summed, `n` is greater than or equal to `n1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers.**
