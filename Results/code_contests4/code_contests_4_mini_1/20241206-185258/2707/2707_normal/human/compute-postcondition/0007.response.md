According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n1` must be greater than 0. The variables `n`, `n2`, `a`, and `s1` do not affect the execution of the loop in this specific case. 

So, for the loop to be executed the first time, `n1` should be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting value of the loop variable). 

State: **`n`, `n1` is greater than 0, `n2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 0, `i` is 0**
