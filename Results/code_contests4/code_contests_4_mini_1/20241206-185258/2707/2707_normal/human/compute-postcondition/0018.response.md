The value of `s2` is updated by adding the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]` to it. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1, so we calculate the index as `n - n1 - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - n1 - 2`. The value of `a[n - n1 - 2]` is used to update `s2`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is equal to the sum of the last `n1` elements of the sorted list `a`; `n1` is the number of elements summed; `n` is greater than or equal to `n1`; `s2` is updated to be the previous value of `s2` plus `a[n - n1 - 2]`; `n2` is greater than 1; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`s1` is equal to the sum of the last `n1` elements of the sorted list `a`; `n1` is the number of elements summed; `n` is greater than or equal to `n1`; `s2` is updated to be the previous value of `s2` plus `a[n - n1 - 2]`; `n2` is greater than 1; `i` is 1**
