Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `n1`, and `n2`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the average of the largest `n1` integers and the next largest `n2` integers from the sorted list `a`, printing the sum of these averages. It assumes valid input according to the constraints provided, without handling invalid input cases. **
