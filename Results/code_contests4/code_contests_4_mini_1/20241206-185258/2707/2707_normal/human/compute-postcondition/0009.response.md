According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n1` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n1` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `n1` is greater than 1, `n2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers; `s1` is updated to `s1 + a[n - i - 1]`, where `s1` was previously 0; `i` is 1**
