The values of `n1` and `n2` are swapped, with `n1` being assigned the previous value of `n2`, and `n2` being assigned the previous value of `n1`. Since it is given that `n1` is greater than `n2`, after the swap, `n2` will be greater than `n1`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and there are no other variables affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1` (now `n2`), `n2` (now `n1`) are assigned the swapped values, and `a` is a sorted list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is assigned integer values from input; `n1` is now the previous value of `n2`; `n2` is now the previous value of `n1`; `a` is a sorted list of integers.**
