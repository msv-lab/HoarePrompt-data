The statement `s1 += a[n - i - 1]` updates the value of `s1` by adding the element at index `n - i - 1` from the list `a`. Given that `i` is currently 2, this means we're accessing the element at index `n - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. 

Since `n` is greater than 0 and `n1` is greater than 1, the conditions imply that `n` is at least 3 to access a valid index, making `n - 3` non-negative. 

The previous value of `s1` was 0, and it is updated to `s1 + a[n - 3]`. Therefore, the value of `s1` becomes `a[n - 3]`.

The states of `n`, `n1`, `n2`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `n1` is greater than 1, `n2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers; `s1` is updated to `a[n - 3]`, `i` is 2**
