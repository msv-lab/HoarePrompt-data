According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n2`. If `i` is less than `n2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n2` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. For the loop to continue executing, `n2` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`s1` is equal to the sum of the last `n1` elements of the sorted list `a`; `n1` is the number of elements summed; `n` is greater than or equal to `n1`; `s2` is the previous value of `s2` plus `a[n - n1 - 1]; n2` is greater than 1; `i` is 1**
