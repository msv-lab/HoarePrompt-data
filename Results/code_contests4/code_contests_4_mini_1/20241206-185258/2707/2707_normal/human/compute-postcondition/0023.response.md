The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as defined in the provided signature. However, it relies on constraints given for variables `n`, `n1`, `n2`, and `a`, which are indirectly implied to be part of the function's internal logic or context. 

The constraints specify that:
- `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, n1, n2 ≤ 100,000 and n1 + n2 ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000.

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information, but since it is implied that the function operates based on the constraints and relationships given, we can deduce that it processes the list `a` in some manner according to the values of `n`, `n1`, and `n2`.

Since no specific cases or return values are described in the output, we can summarize the functionality based solely on the accepted constraints.

Functionality: **The function relies on constraints for integers n, n1, n2, and a list a of integers, and processes these inputs according to its internal logic, which is not explicitly defined.**
