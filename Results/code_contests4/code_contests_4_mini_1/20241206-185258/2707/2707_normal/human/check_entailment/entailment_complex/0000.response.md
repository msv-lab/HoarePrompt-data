To determine whether the given program is correct according to the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements laid out in the problem statement.

### Problem Summary:
1. You have `n` candidates with wealth values.
2. You need to select `n1` candidates for the first city and `n2` candidates for the second city.
3. The goal is to maximize the sum of the arithmetic means of the wealths of the two groups.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads `n`, `n1`, and `n2` from input, and a list `a` of wealth values. This is correctly done as per the problem description.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The wealth list `a` is sorted. This is necessary as to maximize the averages, we need to consider the largest wealth values.

3. **Condition to Swap `n1` and `n2`**:
   - If `n1 > n2`, the program swaps their values. This ensures that `n1` is always less than or equal to `n2`. This step is not strictly necessary for the correct computation of the means but simplifies the accumulation of wealth for the two cities.

4. **Calculating Sums**:
   - The program calculates `s1` as the sum of the largest `n1` wealth values. It does this by iterating from the end of the sorted list.
   - It then calculates `s2` as the sum of the next `n2` largest wealth values, starting from the index immediately after the last index used for `s1`.
   
5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The arithmetic means are computed as `s1 / n1` and `s2 / n2`, and their sum is printed.

### Correctness Check:
- The program effectively selects the top `n1` wealth values for the first city and the next top `n2` wealth values for the second city, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the arithmetic means.
- The swapping of `n1` and `n2` is a strategic choice, ensuring that we handle the larger group last, which doesn't impact the maximum possible sums.
- The final output produces a real value that represents the maximum possible sum of the arithmetic means, adhering to the output requirements specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as outlined in the problem description. It ensures that the sums of the top wealth values are calculated and averaged correctly to yield the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
