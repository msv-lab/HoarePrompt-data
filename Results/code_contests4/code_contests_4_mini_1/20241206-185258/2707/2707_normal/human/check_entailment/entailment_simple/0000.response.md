To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We have `n` candidates with wealth represented in an array `a`.
2. We need to select `n1` candidates for the first city and `n2` candidates for the second city such that the sum of their arithmetic means is maximized.
3. The arithmetic mean for a city is computed as the total wealth of selected candidates divided by the number of candidates in that city.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n`, `n1`, and `n2`, then reads the wealth values into a list `a`.
2. **Sorting**: The wealth list `a` is sorted. This is crucial because to maximize the arithmetic means, we need to select the wealthiest candidates.
3. **City Selection Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n1` is greater than `n2` and swaps their values if necessary. This ensures that `n1` is always the smaller or equal value, which simplifies the selection process.
4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `s1` as the sum of the wealth of the top `n1` candidates (which are the last `n1` elements of the sorted list).
   - Then, it calculates `s2` as the sum of the next `n2` wealthiest candidates (which are the last `n2` elements just before the last `n1` elements).
5. **Final Calculation**: The program computes and prints the sum of the arithmetic means for both cities.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly identifies the wealthiest candidates for both cities by sorting the wealth list.
- It ensures the selection is optimal by always choosing the highest available wealth candidates for both cities.
- The arithmetic mean is calculated correctly as the total wealth divided by the number of candidates.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described and adheres to the constraints provided, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
