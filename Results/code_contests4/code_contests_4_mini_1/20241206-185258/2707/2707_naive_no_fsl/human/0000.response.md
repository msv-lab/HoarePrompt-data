To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires selecting subsets of candidates for two cities such that the sum of their arithmetic means of wealth is maximized.

The program first reads the input values and sorts the list of wealth in ascending order. It then ensures that the first city has the smaller number of residents (`n1`), and it calculates the maximum wealth for both cities by:

1. Selecting the top `n1` wealthiest candidates for the first city.
2. Selecting the next `n2` wealthiest candidates for the second city.

The program then computes the arithmetic means for both cities and sums them up for the final output.

### Potential Issues

1. **Incorrect Selection of Candidates**: 
   - The program sorts the wealth in ascending order and picks the last `n1` and `n2` candidates. However, if `n1` is less than or equal to `n2`, the logic holds. But if `n1` is greater than `n2`, it swaps `n1` and `n2` and then selects the candidates. This approach does not guarantee that the wealth distribution is optimal.
   - For instance, consider the case:
     - `n = 5, n1 = 3, n2 = 2`
     - Wealths: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
     - The program would choose candidates `3, 4, 5` for city 1 and `2, 1` for city 2, yielding a mean of `(3 + 4 + 5)/3 + (2 + 1)/2 = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5`.
     - However, the optimal selection would be to choose `4, 5` for city 1 and `3` for city 2, yielding `(4 + 5)/2 + 3 = 4.5 + 3 = 7.5`.
   - This shows that the current logic does not necessarily yield the maximum sum of means for all configurations.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not account for edge cases where `n1` and `n2` are equal or when there are very few candidates. It assumes a fixed selection order based purely on sorted values, which can lead to suboptimal selections.

Given the above analysis, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
