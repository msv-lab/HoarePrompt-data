Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of programmers (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is a positive integer representing the number of lines of code to be written (1 ≤ m ≤ 500), b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum total number of bugs allowed (0 ≤ b ≤ 500), mod is a positive integer for the modulo operation (1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^9 + 7), and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer ai represents the number of bugs per line for each programmer (0 ≤ ai ≤ 500).**
