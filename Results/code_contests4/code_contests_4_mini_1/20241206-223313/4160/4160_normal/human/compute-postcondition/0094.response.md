The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The previous values are as follows: `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is set to `a[2]`. The variable `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]` because `i` is 3. 

Given that `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1, and we need to make sure that `k - a[i - 1]` (which is `k - a[2]`) is a valid index for `mem`. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated accordingly.

The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `a[2]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[2]]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `a[2]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[2]]`.**
