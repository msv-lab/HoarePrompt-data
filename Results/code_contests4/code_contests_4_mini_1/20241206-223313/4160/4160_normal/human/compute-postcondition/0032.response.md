The statement `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is currently `1`, so `ix ^ 1` will yield `0`. The variable `j` is `3`, and `k` is equal to `a[0]`. 

Assuming `mem` is a three-dimensional array, this operation does not change the values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `a[0]`, `k`). Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables as well as the assignment taking place.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[0]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.**
