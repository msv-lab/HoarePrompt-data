Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[0] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[1][j][k]`. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is changed based on the result of adding `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
