The code assigns a value to `mem[ix][j][k]` by using the function `add` which takes two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

1. The variable `ix` is 0. 
2. The variable `j` is 1. 
3. The variable `k` is `a[1] + 1`.
4. The term `mem[ix][j][k]` refers to `mem[0][1][k]`.
5. The term `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` refers to `mem[0][0][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Thus, `mem[0][1][k]` is updated by adding its current value to the value of `mem[0][0][k - a[i - 1]]`, but since the exact values of `mem` and `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the resulting values explicitly.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[1] + 1`, and `mem[0][1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[0][1][k]` and `mem[0][0][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[1] + 1`, and `mem[0][1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[0][1][k]` and `mem[0][0][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
