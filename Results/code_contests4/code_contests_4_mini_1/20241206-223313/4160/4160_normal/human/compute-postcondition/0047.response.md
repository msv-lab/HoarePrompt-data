To analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state, we break down the operations step by step.

1. The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is being updated with the result of the function `add()` called with two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
2. The variable `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is `a[i - 1]`, where `i` is 2, so `k` becomes `a[1]` (which is the value in array `a` at index 1).
3. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is computed by adding its current value to the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, which translates to `mem[0][1][k]` being updated by the addition of `mem[0][0][k - a[1]]`.

The initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `mem`, or the outcome of the `add()` function. However, we can summarize the operation as modifying `mem[ix][j][k]` based on the values of other indices.

Thus, the output state reflects the assignment that occurs without specific numeric results since they depend on the values in `mem` and `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[1]`; `mem[0][1][k]` is updated by adding `mem[0][1][k]` and `mem[0][0][k - a[1]]`.**
