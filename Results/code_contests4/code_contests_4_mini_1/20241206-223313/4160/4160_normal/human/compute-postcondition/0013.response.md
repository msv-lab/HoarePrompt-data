The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is initially 1, so `ix ^ 1` results in 0. Therefore, the code effectively assigns `mem[0][j][k]` to `mem[1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, etc.) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and the value of `mem[1][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[0][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `mem[1][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[0][j][k]`**
