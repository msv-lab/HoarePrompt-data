The value of `ix` is assigned the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and `1`. The value of `i` is `3`, so the calculation is `3 & 1`, which results in `1`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `mem`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, and `mem[0][m][k]` is updated based on contributions from all previous iterations for each k in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, and `mem[0][m][k]` is updated based on contributions from all previous iterations for each k in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.**
