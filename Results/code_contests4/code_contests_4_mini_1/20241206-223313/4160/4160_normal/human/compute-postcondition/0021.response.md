The statement `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value from the array `mem` at the index `[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to the array `mem` at the index `[ix][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` equals 0. Therefore, the assignment takes the value from `mem[0][j][k]` and assigns it to `mem[1][j][k]`.

The variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `a`, and `k` are unchanged by this operation. The initial state of these variables remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is currently `a[0]`, and `mem[1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`**.
