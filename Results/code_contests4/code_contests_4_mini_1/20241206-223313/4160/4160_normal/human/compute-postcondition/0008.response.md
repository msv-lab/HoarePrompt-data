According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 1, the value of `i` does not impact the execution of the loop. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 1, as specified by the `range(1, m + 1)`. Given that `ix` is currently 1, it does not play a role in the execution of the loop either.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `m` must be at least 1, and `j` will be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
