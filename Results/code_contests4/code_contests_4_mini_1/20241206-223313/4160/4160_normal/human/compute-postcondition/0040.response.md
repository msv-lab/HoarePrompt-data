To analyze the state of the variables after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the nature of the loop and the initial conditions provided.

The loop iterates over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`. Given that `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `k` starts from `a[0]`, the loop will execute for each integer value of `k` from `a[0]` to `b`, inclusive. 

During each iteration:
1. `mem[ix][j][k]` is first updated to hold the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
2. Then, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to include the result of adding `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

After the loop finishes executing:
- The loop will have processed all values from `k = a[0]` to `k = b`, meaning that `k` will have taken on all values in that range.
- The final value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be determined by the cumulative operations performed during the iterations, specifically incorporating values from both `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Given that `k` will end at `b`, the final state of the variables will reflect that `k` is equal to `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` has been fully updated as per the operations defined in the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final updated value from all iterations of the loop.**
