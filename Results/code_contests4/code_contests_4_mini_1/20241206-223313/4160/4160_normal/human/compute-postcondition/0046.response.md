The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Here, `ix` is 0, so `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 1. Thus, `mem[0][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[1][j][k]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, and `k`) remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `mem[1][m][k]` is updated, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is `a[i - 1]`; `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `mem[1][m][k]` is updated, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[i - 1]`; `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][j][k]`.**
