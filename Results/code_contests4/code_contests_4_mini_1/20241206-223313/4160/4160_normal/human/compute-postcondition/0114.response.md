Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `mem` is a 3D list where `mem[0][j][k]` and `mem[1][j][k]` contain counts based on the contributions from all elements of `a` and their respective combinations, `ans` is 0 or the result of some cumulative operation based on `mem`, depending on further calculations outside the loop.**
