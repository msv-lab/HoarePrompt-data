According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `b`. The loop iterates over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`. 

Additionally, before the loop starts, `ix` and `j` are set to `m + 1`, and `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. This means that the loop can execute only if `m` is at least 2, which implies that `ix` and `j` would be at least 3.

Therefore, to summarize the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute:

1. `b` must be greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`.
2. `ix` is at least 3 (since `j` is also at least 3, corresponding to `m` being at least 2).
3. The value of `k` must be initialized to `a[i - 1]` for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated, `ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, for the loop to execute the first time `b >= a[i - 1]`, `k` is initialized to `a[i - 1]**
