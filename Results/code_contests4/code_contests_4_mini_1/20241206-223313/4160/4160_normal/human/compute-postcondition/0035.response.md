The line of code `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The operation `ix ^ 1` will toggle the value of `ix`, which is currently 1, resulting in `0`. Therefore, `mem[0][j][k]` will be updated with the value from `mem[1][j][k]`. 

The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `a[0]`, `k`, and `mem` are not directly affected by this line of code, and their previous states remain unchanged. 

Since `j` is 3 and `k` is `a[0] + 1`, the values of `mem[0][3][k]` will be updated based on the value previously stored in `mem[1][3][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[0] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[1][j][k]`.**
