The code assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variables involved are `ix`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `ix` is 0, thus `ix ^ 1` is 1. The value of `j` is 2, and `k` is `a[1]`. The state of `mem` at `ix` (which is 0) will be updated based on the value from `mem[1][2][k]`.

Since `mem[0][2][k]` is updated with `mem[1][2][k]`, the values of `mem` will reflect this change, while `n`, `i`, `ix`, `j`, `m`, and the contributions from previous iterations remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is `a[1]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[1][2][k]`.**
