`ix` is assigned the value of `i & 1`, which performs a bitwise AND operation between `i` and `1`. Given that `i` is `1`, the result of `1 & 1` is `1`. Therefore, `ix` is `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1**
