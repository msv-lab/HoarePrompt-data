The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Here, `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` results in 0. The values of `j` and `k` are both used as indices. Since `mem` is a multi-dimensional structure, the specific values at those indices are not provided. However, the value of `mem[0][j][k]` is copied to `mem[1][j][k]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`) are unchanged, so the output state reflects the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[2] + 1, mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.**
