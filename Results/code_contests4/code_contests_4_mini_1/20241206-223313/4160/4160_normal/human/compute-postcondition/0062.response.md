According to the code, the loop executes based on the range defined by `k`, which starts from `a[i - 1]` and goes to `b + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 from its last value. 

At the end of the last iteration, `mem[ix][j][k]` was updated, and `k` was at its last value, which is `b`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be `b + 1`, and for it to iterate again, it must have been incremented from its previous maximum value of `b`.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, while `mem[ix][j][k]` was previously updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be `b + 1`**
