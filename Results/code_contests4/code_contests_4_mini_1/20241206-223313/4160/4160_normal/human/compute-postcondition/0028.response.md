The operation updates the `mem` array at the position `[ix][j][k]` by adding the value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are currently 1, 2, and `a[0] + 2`, respectively. The value that will be added is taken from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

The previous states of the affected variables are:
- `ix` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `k` is `a[0] + 2`
- `mem[1][2][k]` is assigned a value that is the result of the `add` function applied to `mem[1][2][k]` and `mem[1][1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Since the specifics of `a[i-1]` and the `add` function are not provided, we cannot determine the exact output values, but the operation does change the value at `mem[ix][j][k]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is currently `a[0] + 2`, and `mem[1][2][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[1][2][k]` and `mem[1][1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is currently `a[0] + 2`, and `mem[1][2][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[1][2][k]` and `mem[1][1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
