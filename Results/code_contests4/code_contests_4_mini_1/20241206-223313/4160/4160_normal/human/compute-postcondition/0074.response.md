The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` are present in the indexing, but their specific values are not provided. However, `ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, and `k` equals `a[i - 1] + 2`. The assignment does not change the values of `ix`, `j`, or `k`, nor does it provide a specific computed value for `mem[ix][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 2`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 2`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]**
