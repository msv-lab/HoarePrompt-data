According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `k`, `a[i - 1]`, and `b`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is currently equal to `a[i - 1]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, the next value of `k` will be `k + 1`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and does not affect the loop iterations directly, it will remain unchanged. The other variables `i`, `ix`, and `j` also do not change for the next iteration of this specific loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect these changes.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 1`, `mem[1][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[0][j][k]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
