The statement updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The variables involved are `ix`, `j`, and `k`, with their current values as follows: `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is `a[2] + 2`. 

Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` becomes 1. The value of `k` is determined by `a[2] + 2`, but since `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, we cannot determine its exact value without more information. However, we know that `k` will be at least 2.

The program executes the addition, but without knowing the specific values in `mem`, we can only state that `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated based on the previous state of `mem[ix][j][k]` and the state of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

The output state will reflect the previous values of the variables and the change made to `mem[ix][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `a[2] + 2, mem[ix][j][k] has been updated to mem[ix][j][k] + mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]**
