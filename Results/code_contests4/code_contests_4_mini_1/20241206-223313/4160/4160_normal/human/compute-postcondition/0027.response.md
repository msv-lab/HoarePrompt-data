The code `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value from the `mem` array at the index `[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to the index `[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is 1, which means `ix ^ 1` will be 0. Therefore, the assignment is effectively copying the value from `mem[0][j][k]` to `mem[1][j][k]`.

Since the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `a[0]`, and `k` do not change during this operation, and only the `mem` array is affected, the output state is defined by the changes made to `mem`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is currently `a[0] + 2`, and `mem[1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.**
