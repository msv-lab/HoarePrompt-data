The line of code assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variables affected by this assignment are `mem[ix]`, `mem[ix ^ 1]`, `j`, and `k`. 

- The value of `ix` is currently 0, so `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 1. 
- The value of `j` is 1.
- The value of `k` is `a[1] + 2`.

Since the initial values of `mem` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values stored in `mem[ix][j][k]` or `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. However, the operation is valid as it just copies the value from one position in the `mem` array to another.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ix`, `j`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, we conclude that while the value in `mem` has been updated, the other variables retain their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[1] + 2`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.**
