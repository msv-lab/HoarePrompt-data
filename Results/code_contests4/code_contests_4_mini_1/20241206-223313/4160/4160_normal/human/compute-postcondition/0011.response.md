The code assigns the value to `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the result of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The initial values indicate that `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and `mem[1][1][k]` has already been updated to `mem[0][1][k]`. 

However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific value of `k - a[i - 1]`. The value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` depends on this undefined value as well as the current state of `mem`. 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and `mem[1][1][k]` is already updated, we can conclude that the operation affects `mem[1][1][k]` but does not change the other variables. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the current values along with the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `mem[1][1][k]` is updated by adding `mem[1][0][k - a[0]]` to it**.
