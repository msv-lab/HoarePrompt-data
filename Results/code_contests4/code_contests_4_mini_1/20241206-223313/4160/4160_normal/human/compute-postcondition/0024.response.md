The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Given that `ix` is 1, this means `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 0, thus it retrieves the value from `mem[0][j][k]` and assigns it to `mem[1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is currently `a[0] + 1`, and `mem[1][2][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[0][2][k]`.**
