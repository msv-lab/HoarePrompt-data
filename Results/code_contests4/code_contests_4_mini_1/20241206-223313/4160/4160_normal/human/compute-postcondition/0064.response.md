The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` remains unchanged in the output state. The values of `ix`, `j`, `k`, and `a[i - 1]` are not specified, but they are used in the addition operation. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is the sum of its previous value and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` based on its previous value; other variables remain unaffected.**
