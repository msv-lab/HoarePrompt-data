The line of code assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is 0, so `ix ^ 1` equals 1. Therefore, the assignment translates to `mem[0][j][k] = mem[1][j][k]`. The values of `j` and `k` are used as indices, but since their specific values are not given, we can't determine the exact values being assigned. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[1] + 1, mem[0][j][k] = mem[1][j][k]**
