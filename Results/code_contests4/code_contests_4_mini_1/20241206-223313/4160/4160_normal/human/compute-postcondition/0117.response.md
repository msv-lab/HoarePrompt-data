According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute for the first time, `b` must be at least 0. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 with each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than or equal to `b`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `b` must be at least 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 1**
