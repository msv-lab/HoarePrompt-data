The code assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` would be 0. The variables `j` and `k` retain their previous values of 2 and `a[2] + 2`, respectively. This operation does not modify the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, or `b`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `a[2] + 2`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated to the value of `mem[0][2][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `a[2] + 2, mem[ix][j][k] has been updated to mem[0][2][k]**
