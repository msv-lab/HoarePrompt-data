The code assigns the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` to the result of the function `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`. The previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is used in the addition, along with the values from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged in this operation. Hence, after execution, the state of the variables is updated as follows.

Output State: **`ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `k` is initialized to `a[i - 1] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`.**
