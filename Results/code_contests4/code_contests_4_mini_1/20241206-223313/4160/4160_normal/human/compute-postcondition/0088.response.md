The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 0. Thus, the operation accesses `mem[0][j][k]` and assigns that value to `mem[1][j][k]` (since `ix` is 1). 

The previous values of `j` and `k` are not modified and remain the same. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, and `mem`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[2] + 2`, `mem[1][1][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][1][k]`.**
