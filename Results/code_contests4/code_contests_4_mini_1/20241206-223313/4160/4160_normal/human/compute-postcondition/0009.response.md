According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `b`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `k` (which is `a[i - 1]`) must be less than or equal to `b`. 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `ix` is 1, we need to ensure that `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]` in this case) is less than or equal to `b`. Additionally, the value of `k` will start at `a[i - 1]`.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- The condition `a[0] <= b` must hold true.
- The value of `k` will start from `a[0]`.

Thus, we need to maintain that `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b` while keeping the other states unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time m is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`**
