The statement assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` will be 0. The values of `j` and `k` are 3 and `a[0] + 2`, respectively. The output state remains unchanged for `n`, `i`, `b`, `a`, and the dimensions of `mem` are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[0] + 2`, and the assignment `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[0][j][k]` takes place.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[0] + 2`, and the assignment `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[0][j][k]` takes place.**
