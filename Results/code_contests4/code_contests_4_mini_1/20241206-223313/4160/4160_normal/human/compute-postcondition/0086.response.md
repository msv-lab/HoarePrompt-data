To analyze the provided code snippet, let's break down the assignment and the operation being performed:

1. The code assigns a value to `mem[ix][j][k]` using the `add` function. The arguments to `add` are `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

2. Before this operation, we know:
   - `ix` is 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `k` is the result of the expression `a[2] + 1`, but the exact value of `k` depends on the value of `a[2]`, which is unknown.
   - `i` is 3, meaning `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. The operation `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` computes the new value of `mem[1][1][k]`. The result of `add` is not specified, but it will affect the value of `mem[1][1][k]`.

4. The value `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` translates to `mem[1][0][k - a[2]]`. The exact values of these elements in the `mem` array are not provided.

5. After executing the line, `mem[ix][j][k]` will have a new value based on the addition of its previous value and the value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Since the values in the `mem` array and the exact output of the `add` function are not specified, we'll summarize the state without specific numerical values:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[2] + 1, mem[1][1][k]` is updated to `add(mem[1][1][k], mem[1][0][k - a[2]])`.**
