To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop code and the initial state provided.

Given the code of the loop:
```
for k in range(a[i - 1], b + 1):
    mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]
    mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])
```

We can infer the following:

1. `k` iterates from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, which means it will execute a number of times equal to `b - a[i - 1] + 1`.
2. After the loop completes, the values of `mem[ix][j][k]` will have been updated for each `k` in that range.
3. The variable `ix` remains 1, `i` remains 1, and `j` remains 1 throughout the loop.
4. The relationship between `mem[ix][j][k]`, `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` indicates that `mem[ix][j][k]` will contain a cumulative value based on previous states of the `mem` array.

Based on the output states provided after each of the first three iterations, we can conclude the following after all iterations have completed:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `mem[1][1][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b` based on the previous values of `mem` and the added contributions from `mem[1][0][k - a[0]]` for each `k` in that range.**
