The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` equals 0. The values of `j` and `k` are 3 and `a[2]` respectively, and `k` is defined as `a[2]`. The previous values of the relevant variables do not change as a result of this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values along with the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[2]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][3][k]`.**
