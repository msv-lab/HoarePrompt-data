The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the result of adding `mem[ix][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[2] + 2`. 

To summarize the update:
- The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` changes based on the addition to `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, but without specific values for `mem` and `a`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `mem[ix][j][k]`. However, the operation will affect `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Since the details of `mem` and `a` are not provided, the output state focuses on the variables and the operation taking place.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[2] + 2`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the new value after the addition.**
