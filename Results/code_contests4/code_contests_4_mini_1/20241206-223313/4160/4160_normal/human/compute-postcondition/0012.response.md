According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `a[i - 1]` and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, and `j` is 1, with `k` having taken the value corresponding to `a[i - 1]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will need to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` will be `k + 1`. Additionally, since `k` starts from `a[i - 1]`, for the loop to execute again, the new value of `k` must be less than or equal to `b`. 

Thus, if `a[i - 1]` is the starting point for `k`, the next value of `k` would be `a[i - 1] + 1`. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to `a[0] + 1` and less than or equal to `b`**
