According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, which means `k` will be iterating from `a[2]` to `b`. Since `k` is equal to `a[2]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. 

To determine the new state, we need to ensure that `k` remains within the bounds specified by `b`. Given that `b` is defined as the upper limit and `k` starts from `a[2]`, the next valid value for `k` will be `a[2] + 1`, provided that this value does not exceed `b`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to update `k` to `a[2] + 1`. The conditions for `n`, `ix`, `j`, `m`, `mem[ix][j][k]`, and `a[2]` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `a[2] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[2]]`.**
