The value `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is currently 1, so `ix ^ 1` equals 0. Thus, `mem[ix][j][k]` gets the value from `mem[0][j][k]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mem` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[0][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[0][j][k]`**.
