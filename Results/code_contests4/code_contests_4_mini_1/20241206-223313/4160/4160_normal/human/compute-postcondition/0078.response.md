According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. This means that the loop has executed for `i` equal to 1 and 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 3. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it must also be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` becomes 3.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, and `mem[0][m][k]` is updated based on contributions from all previous iterations for each k in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.**
