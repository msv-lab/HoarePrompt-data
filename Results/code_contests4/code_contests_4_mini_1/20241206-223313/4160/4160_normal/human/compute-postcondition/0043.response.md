Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `mem[1][m][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b` based on the cumulative results from all previous iterations of `j` and the contributions from `mem[1][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` for each `k` in that range, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.**
