To evaluate the impact of the given code on the initial state, we consider the following:

1. The variable `k` is defined as `k = a[i - 1] + 1`, which means its value is dependent on the array `a` at the index `i - 1`.
2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```
   mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])
   ```
   This line updates `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the result of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it, using the `add` function.

Given that:
- `ix` is 1,
- `j` is 1,
- `k` is calculated from `a[i - 1] + 1`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` will also be at least 1, thus `k` will be at least `a[0] + 1`.

Since the context of `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values for `k` or the values in the `mem` array. However, we can still provide a general output state reflecting that `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated based on the values of `mem`.

The output state will summarize that `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated, but we cannot specify exact values without knowing the contents of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it.**
