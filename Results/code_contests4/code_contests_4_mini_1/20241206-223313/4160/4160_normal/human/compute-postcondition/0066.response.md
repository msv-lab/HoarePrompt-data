According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its maximum value of `m`, which indicates it has been incremented from 1 to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m + 1`. Since `m` must be at least 2, the loop will not execute again if `j` reaches `m + 1`.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on contributions from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` for all `k` in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `ix`, `j` is `m + 1`, and `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
