The statement `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Here, `ix` is 1, and `ix ^ 1` results in 0. The variables `j` and `k` are both 1 (as per the initial state), so the assignment translates to `mem[1][1][k] = mem[0][1][k]`. 

This means that the value at `mem[1][1][k]` will be updated to whatever the value is at `mem[0][1][k]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `a[0]` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `mem[1][1][k]` is updated to `mem[0][1][k]`**.
