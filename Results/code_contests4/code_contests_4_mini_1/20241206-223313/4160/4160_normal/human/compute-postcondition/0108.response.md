The code assigns the value of `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are defined, where `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[2] + 1`. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated based on the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

Since `i` is 3, we need to evaluate `a[i - 1]`, which is `a[2]`. The previous state of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[2]]`. 

The exact values of `a[2]`, `mem[0][3][k]`, and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[2]]` are not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine specific numerical results. However, we know that the operation will affect the value of `mem[ix][j][k]`, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[2] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[2] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`**.
