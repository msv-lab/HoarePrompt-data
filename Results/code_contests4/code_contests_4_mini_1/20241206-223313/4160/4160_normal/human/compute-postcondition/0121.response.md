Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `mem` is a 3D list with counts based on contributions from `a`, `ans` is updated to the cumulative sum of `mem[n & 1][m][i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `b`, and `i` is equal to `b` after the loop finishes executing.**
