The code updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. Given that `ix` and `j` are both at least 3, `k` is defined as `a[i - 1] + 2`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is currently equal to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, the operation will modify `mem[ix][j][k]` based on the values from the `mem` array at positions determined by `j` and `k`.

Since the previous state of `mem[ix][j][k]` is influenced by `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and the addition involves `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, the outcome will depend on these specific values.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated based on the addition operation without altering `ix`, `j`, or `k`.

Output State: **`ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 2`, `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated to `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`**.
