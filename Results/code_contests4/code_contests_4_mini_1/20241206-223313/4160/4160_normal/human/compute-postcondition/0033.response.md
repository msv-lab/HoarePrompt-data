The code assigns a new value to `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` with the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The variable `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[0]`. The previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is affected by the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, but since the specific values of `mem` and `a` are not given, we can't state exact values after execution. 

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a[0]`, `b`, `k`, and `mem`) remain unchanged aside from the update to `mem[ix][j][k]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[0]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[0]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
