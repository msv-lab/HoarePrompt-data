The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The value of `ix ^ 1` will toggle `ix` between 0 and 1 since `ix` is 1. Therefore, `ix ^ 1` results in 0. The other variables `j` and `k` remain unchanged, and the values of `mem` are assumed to be defined correctly.

The previous values for the affected variables are:
- `ix` is 1, leading to `ix ^ 1` resulting in 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is equal to `a[2] + 1`.

Since `mem[ix][j][k]` is now being updated to the value of `mem[0][2][k]`, the specific values of `mem` are not provided, but we note that the assignment takes place.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `a[2] + 1, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[0][2][k]`.**
