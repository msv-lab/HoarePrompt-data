The code snippet updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the result of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. Since `j` is 1, the expression `j - 1` results in 0. The value of `k` is defined as `a[1] + 2`, and we do not have the specific values for `a` or `mem`. However, we can state that `mem[ix][j][k]` is now modified based on the value of `mem[ix][0][k - a[i - 1]]`.

The overall impact is that `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on a specific previous state of `mem`, and the previous values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[1] + 2`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is now updated based on `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][0][k - a[i - 1]])`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[1] + 2`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][0][k - a[i - 1]])`**.
