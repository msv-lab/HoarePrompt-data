According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 since the next value of `j` will be 2. 

Thus, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2 for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
