The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is not directly modified by this assignment, but it is replaced by the value from the alternative index `ix ^ 1`. The other variables, including `ix`, `j`, and `k`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `k` is initialized to `a[i - 1] + 1` for the loop, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `k` is initialized to `a[i - 1] + 1` for the loop, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.**
