According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `b` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `b` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 2; `ans` is assigned the value returned by `add(ans, mem[n & 1][m][i])`.**
