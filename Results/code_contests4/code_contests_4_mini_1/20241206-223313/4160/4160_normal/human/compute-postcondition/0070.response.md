According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`, which is controlled by the range defined in the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is initialized to `a[i - 1]`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Since `k` starts at `a[i - 1]`, for the next iteration, `k` will be `a[i - 1] + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `a[i - 1] + 1` must be less than or equal to `b`. 

Thus, the updated state needs to reflect that `k` has increased by 1. The values of `ix` and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by this loop.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][0]` to its previous value; `ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is initialized to `a[i - 1] + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, and it must satisfy `a[i - 1] + 1` â‰¤ `b`.**
