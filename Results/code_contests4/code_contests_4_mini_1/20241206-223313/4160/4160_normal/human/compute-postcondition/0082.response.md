The statement assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` are used to index into the `mem` structure. 

- `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` equals 0.
- `j` is 1, and `k` is initialized to `a[2]`. The exact value of `k` depends on the contents of the array `a`, but it is assumed to be defined based on the initial state.
  
Therefore, the operation copies the value from `mem[0][1][k]` to `mem[1][1][k]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is initialized to `a[2]`, and `mem[1][1][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][1][k]`.**
