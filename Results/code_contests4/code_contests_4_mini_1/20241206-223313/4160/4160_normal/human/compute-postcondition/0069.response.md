The line of code assigns a value to `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` to the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` has already been assigned from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. 

In this operation, `k` is initialized to `a[i - 1]`, which means the expression `k - a[i - 1]` will evaluate to `0` since `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`. Therefore, the value being added is `mem[ix][j - 1][0]`.

The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged apart from the assignment to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The other variables are not directly affected.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][0]` to its previous value; `ix` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is initialized to `a[i - 1]**
