The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `mem[0][j][k]` is assigned to `mem[1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `a[2]`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` is `a[2] + 2`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.**
