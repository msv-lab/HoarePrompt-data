According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `a[i - 1]` and `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. We know that `k` is currently `a[1] + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `b`. Since `k` is currently `a[1] + 1`, the next value of `k` will be `a[1] + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `b` must be greater than or equal to `a[1] + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `a[1] + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `b` must be greater than or equal to `a[1] + 2**
