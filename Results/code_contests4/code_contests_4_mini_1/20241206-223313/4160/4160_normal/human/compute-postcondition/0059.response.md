According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `b`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from `a[i - 1]` up to `b`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at the last value it took in the loop, which is `b` if the loop executed at least once. 

To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration, we need to check if `k` can be incremented for the loop to execute again. If `k` is less than `b`, then it can execute one more time. Therefore, to execute the loop again, `k` should be incremented by 1.

Assuming `k` was last set to `b` in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be updated to `b + 1`, and the condition for the loop to execute again requires `a[i - 1]` to be less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `add(mem[ix][2][k], mem[ix][1][0])`, for the loop to execute one more time `a[i - 1]` must be less than or equal to `b` and `k` must be `b + 1`.**
