The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` results in 0. The indices are now `mem[0][j][k]`. The values of `j` and `k` are defined, with `j` being 2 and `k` starting at `a[2]`. The output state reflects that the variable `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated, but the specific values of `mem` and `k` are not provided.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[2]` is defined and less than or equal to `b`, `k` starts at `a[2]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.**
