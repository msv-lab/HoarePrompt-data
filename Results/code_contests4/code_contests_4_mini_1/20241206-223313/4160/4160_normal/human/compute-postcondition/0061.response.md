The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is not specified, but it will be modified by this addition. The values of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` and `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` are also not specified, but they affect the calculation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` while `mem[ix][j][k]` was previously updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, while `mem[ix][j][k]` was previously updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.**
