#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of strings where the first string contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000), and the next n strings represent the compressed form of string t in the format "li-ci", followed by m strings that represent the compressed form of string s in the same format. Each li is an integer (1 ≤ li ≤ 1,000,000) and ci is a lowercase English letter.
def func_1(ar):
    p = []
    for i in ar:
        x = int(i.split('-')[0])

    #The program returns the list of pairs [total, unique_string] where total is the sum of integers associated with each unique string from ar. If ar is empty, p is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string represents a pair of an integer and a character in the format "li-ci". It processes this list to return a new list of pairs `[total, unique_string]`, where `total` is the cumulative sum of integers for each unique character. If the same character appears consecutively, their associated integers are summed together. If `ar` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of tuples `t` and `s`, where each tuple contains a positive integer and a lowercase English letter, and an integer function `c`. It calculates and returns an accumulated value based on how many characters in the string `t` satisfy the condition `c(i, s[0])` if `s` has length 1. If `s` has length 2, it counts pairs in `t` where both `c(t[i], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 1], s[1])` are true. For longer lengths of `s`, it constructs a new list `v`, applies a prefix function to it, and counts valid indices where certain conditions hold true. The function does not handle cases where `s` is empty or has a length greater than 2 without explicit checks, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
