ar is a list of strings, where each string is in the format "li-ci" representing pairs of lengths (li) and corresponding lowercase English letters (ci). The first element of ar contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000) indicating the number of blocks in the compressed strings t and s respectively. Each subsequent element describes the compressed blocks of t and s, with 1 ≤ li ≤ 1,000,000 for each block's length.
