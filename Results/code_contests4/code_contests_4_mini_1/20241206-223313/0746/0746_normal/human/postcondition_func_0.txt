The function accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string represents a pair of an integer and a character in the format "li-ci". It processes this list to return a new list of pairs `[total, unique_string]`, where `total` is the cumulative sum of integers for each unique character. If the same character appears consecutively, their associated integers are summed together. If `ar` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
