Postcondition: ***`p` is a list with values representing the longest prefix which is also a suffix for each index in `v`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `len(v)` is at least 2. `p[i]` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, the value of `v[i - p[i]]` satisfies the condition `c(v[i - p[i]], s[0])`, and the value of `v[i + 1]` satisfies the condition `c(v[i + 1], s[-1])`.***
