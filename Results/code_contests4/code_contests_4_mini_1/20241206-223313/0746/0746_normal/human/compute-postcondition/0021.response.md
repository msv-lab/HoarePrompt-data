The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `len(t)`, `i`, and the conditions related to the function `c` do not affect the output state directly, but the increment of `ans` is the main change. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 2, `len(t)` is at least 3, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`ans` is 2, `len(t)` is at least 3, `i` is 1**
