Postcondition: ***`p` is a list representing the longest prefix which is also a suffix for each index in `v`. If `p[i]` is equal to `len(s) - 2` and both `c(v[i - p[i]], s[0])` and `c(v[i + 1], s[-1])` are true, then `ans` is updated to 2 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1, `i` remains 1, and the state of `p` remains unchanged.***
