The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` can either be 0 or a value greater than 0, but since it is incremented, it will now be at least 1. The other variables (`v`, `ans`, `len(v)`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]**.
