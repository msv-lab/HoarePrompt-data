The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is either 0 or a value where `v[j]` equals `v[i]`, the new value of `j` will be 1 or greater. The output state reflects that `ans` remains 0 and retains its previous value. The loop has terminated, but the increment of `j` is noted. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is either 1 or greater, `ans` remains 0, and we acknowledge the increment of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is either 1 or greater, `ans` remains 0, and we acknowledge the increment of `j`.**
