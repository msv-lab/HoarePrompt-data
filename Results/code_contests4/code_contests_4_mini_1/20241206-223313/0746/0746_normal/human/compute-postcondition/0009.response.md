According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `t`. If `t` has at least 3 characters, the loop executes again for the third character. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `t`, which means it has been iterated over once. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must have at least 3 characters, and `i` needs to be updated to the third character of `t`. 

State: **`t` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `t`.**
