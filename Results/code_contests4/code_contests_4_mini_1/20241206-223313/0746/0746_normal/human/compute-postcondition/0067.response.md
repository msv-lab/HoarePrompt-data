The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is either 0 or the last value of `p[j]` before the loop terminated. The value of `v[j]` is equal to `v[2]`, and since `j` is incremented, the new value of `j` will be either 1 or the next value in sequence after `p[j]`. Therefore, after execution, the output state reflects that `j` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`j` is either 1 or the next value of `p[j]`; `i` is 2; `v[j]` is equal to `v[2]**
