The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous values indicate that `i` is 2, and `j` is either 0 or the next value of `p[j]`. Therefore, after execution, `p[2]` will be set to the value of `j`. The value of `j` can be determined based on the conditions provided, but since `j` could be 0 or the next value of `p[j]`, the exact value of `p[2]` remains uncertain. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `j` is either 0 or the next value of `p[j]`; `p[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
