`j` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1]`. Since `i` is currently 2, this means `j` will take the value of `p[1]`. The initial state indicates that `j` can either be 0 or a value that satisfies the condition `v[j]` equals `v[i]`. However, the specific value of `p[1]` is not provided, so `j` will take on whatever value `p[1]` holds. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `j` and the condition for `i`.

Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `p[1]`; `i` is 2**
