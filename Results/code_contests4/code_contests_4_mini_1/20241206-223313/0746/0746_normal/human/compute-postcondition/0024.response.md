`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1, so after execution, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`len(t)` and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 2, `len(t)` is at least 3, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`ans` is 2, `len(t)` is at least 3, `i` is 2**
