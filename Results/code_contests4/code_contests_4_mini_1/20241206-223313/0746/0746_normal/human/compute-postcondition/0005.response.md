Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated based on the calculation `ans += i[0] - s[0][0] + 1` if the first character `i` of the string `t` satisfies the condition defined by `c(i, s[0])`. If `ans` is initially 0, then after this execution, it reflects the result of this calculation while `t` remains a string with at least 1 character.***
