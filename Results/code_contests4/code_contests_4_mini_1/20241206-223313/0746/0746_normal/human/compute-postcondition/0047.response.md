The value of `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. Since `j` is greater than 0, and the loop is executing for the first time with the condition `v[j]` not equal to `v[2]`, the specific value of `p[j]` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is updated to `p[j]`, where `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is updated to `p[j]`, where `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[2]**
