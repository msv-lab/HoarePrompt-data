The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `c`. 

- `t` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a positive integer (length of the block) and a lowercase English letter.
- `s` is also a list of tuples with the same structure as `t`.
- `c` is an integer that denotes the total number of characters in the compressed strings.

After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on the conditions:

- **Case 1**: The program returns the accumulated value `ans` based on how many characters in the string `t` satisfy the condition `c(i, s[0])`.
  
- **Case 2**: The program returns the count of pairs in `t` where `c(t[i], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 1], s[1])` are both true.
  
- **Case 3**: The program returns the count of valid indices in list `v` where the longest prefix which is also a suffix for each index matches `len(s) - 2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two lists of tuples (`t` and `s`) and an integer (`c`), and to return different values based on specific conditions related to the contents of these lists and the integer. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of tuples `t` and `s` and an integer `c`, and returns an accumulated value based on characters in `t`, a count of pairs in `t`, or a count of valid indices in list `v` based on specific conditions.**
