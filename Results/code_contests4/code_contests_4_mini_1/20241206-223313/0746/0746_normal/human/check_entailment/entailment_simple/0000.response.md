Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Understanding of Compressed Strings**: The function `func_1` is responsible for converting the compressed string representation into a more usable format (a list of pairs). However, the second function `func_2` does not utilize this information correctly to determine the occurrences of `s` in `t`. The way the compressed strings are meant to be processed is not fully adhered to.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The logic in `func_2` for counting occurrences of `s` in `t` is flawed. The logic for single and double block lengths is overly simplistic and does not generalize to handle cases where the lengths of the blocks in `s` are greater than 1 or 2. The algorithm does not adequately account for the various combinations of blocks that can exist in the compressed representation of `t` when matching against `s`.

3. **Handling Overlaps**: The occurrences of `s` in `t` can overlap. The current implementation does not consider this aspect, which is crucial for accurately counting the occurrences.

4. **Incorrect Use of Conditions**: The checks performed with the function `c` (which is not defined in the provided code) are unclear and likely do not correctly assess whether segments of `t` match the structure required by `s`. The conditions do not encapsulate the full requirements outlined in the problem description.

In summary, the program fails to correctly implement the logic needed to count the occurrences of the compressed string `s` within the compressed string `t`, particularly in terms of handling various block lengths and overlaps, leading to an incorrect implementation.
