To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find how many times a compressed string `s` occurs in another compressed string `t`. Both strings are represented in a compressed form, where each part consists of a length and a character.

### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(ar)`**:
   - This function takes a list of strings representing the compressed form of `t` and `s`, and converts it into a list of pairs `[total, unique_string]` for easier processing.
   - It correctly handles the merging of consecutive blocks of the same character.

2. **Function `func_2(t, s, c)`**:
   - This function is designed to find occurrences of the compressed string `s` in the compressed string `t`.
   - It has specific conditions for lengths of `s` (1, 2, or more).
   - The logic for handling cases when `s` has length 1 or 2 looks reasonable, but the handling of longer lengths is more complex and involves constructing a new list `v` for matching.

### Potential Issues:
- The function `func_2` does not explicitly handle cases where `s` might be empty, which is not allowed by the problem constraints but could lead to unexpected behavior if the inputs were not validated properly. However, according to the problem constraints, `m` (the number of blocks in `s`) is guaranteed to be at least 1.
- The handling of longer strings relies on the prefix function, which could potentially miss some edge cases regarding overlaps or boundaries between blocks if not implemented correctly.

### Edge Cases:
- The code does not have explicit checks for invalid input conditions or malformed compressed strings, which could lead to runtime errors or incorrect outputs if the input format were to deviate from the specification (e.g., if `ar` were empty or had invalid pairs).
- There is no validation for ensuring that the lengths of characters in `t` and `s` can actually accommodate the search, especially when they are very close in terms of lengths.

### Conclusion:
Given the annotations and the edge cases, the implementation seems to have areas where it may not fully adhere to the problem description, particularly around ensuring robustness against input variations and potential edge cases in larger strings.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
