To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we can break down the evaluation into several steps.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
The program is designed to find occurrences of a compressed string `s` within another compressed string `t`. The compression format is such that each string is represented as a series of blocks, each defined by a character and its count. 

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the input list of compressed strings and consolidates consecutive blocks of the same character by summing their lengths.
   - It appears to correctly handle the concatenation of equal characters.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function counts occurrences of the compressed string `s` in `t`.
   - It handles different lengths of `s` (1, 2, and greater than 2) and uses a prefix function approach for efficient matching.
   - However, the function only checks conditions for `s` having lengths of up to 2 in a direct manner. For longer lengths, it constructs a new list `v` and applies a prefix function.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Empty Inputs**: If `s` or `t` were to be empty, the current implementation does not handle this explicitly, although the problem states that `n` and `m` are at least 1.
   
2. **Single Character Matches**: The implementation for length 1 in `func_2` counts occurrences based on conditions but doesnâ€™t consider overlaps effectively.
   
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The handling of the boundaries in the prefix function may lead to incorrect counting if the conditions are not met properly, especially for larger `s`.

4. **Unaccounted Compressions**: The logic assumes that the character counts in `t` can always fulfill the conditions laid out by `s`. However, it does not account for cases where the split between blocks in `s` might not match perfectly with the blocks in `t`.

### Output Hints Examination
The output hints describe that:
- For `s` with length 1, it counts occurrences correctly.
- For `s` with length 2, pairs are checked, which is also described accurately.
- For lengths greater than 2, a prefix function is constructed, but the hints do not mention how overlaps are handled or if all potential cases are covered, which can lead to missing occurrences.

### Conclusion
After evaluating both the code and the output hints:
- The program seems to miss handling certain edge cases, especially those related to overlaps and the construction of the prefix function for longer strings. 
- Specifically, the handling of occurrences for `s` where the blocks do not align perfectly with `t` can lead to incorrect counts.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation**: The program fails to address certain edge cases, particularly those involving overlaps when counting occurrences of longer strings. The prefix function's application may also lead to missed counts when the blocks of characters do not align perfectly.
