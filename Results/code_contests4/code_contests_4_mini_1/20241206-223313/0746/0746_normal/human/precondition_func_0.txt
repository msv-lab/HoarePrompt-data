ar is a list of strings where the first string contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000), and the next n strings represent the compressed form of string t in the format "li-ci", followed by m strings that represent the compressed form of string s in the same format. Each li is an integer (1 ≤ li ≤ 1,000,000) and ci is a lowercase English letter.
