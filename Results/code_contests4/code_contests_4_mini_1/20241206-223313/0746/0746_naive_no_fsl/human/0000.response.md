To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and determine whether it can handle all possible edge cases.

The program is designed to count occurrences of a compressed string `s` within another compressed string `t`. The compression scheme groups equal characters into blocks defined by their length and character.

### Key Functions and Logic:
1. **`func_1(ar)`**: This function processes the input strings in their compressed form, converting them into a list of blocks where each block is represented as a list `[length, character]`. This part of the code appears to be correct as it aggregates lengths of consecutive identical characters.
  
2. **`func_2(t, s, c)`**: This function attempts to determine how many times the compressed string `s` occurs in the compressed string `t`. 
    - The implementation has specific conditions based on the length of `s`. 
    - It builds a partial match table (similar to KMP algorithm) for a combined list of `s` and `t` to find matches.
  
### Potential Issues:
1. **Complexity of Matching**: The method of checking for matches in `func_2` may not handle all cases correctly. For example, if `s` requires a specific arrangement of blocks that are not contiguous in `t`, the logic may fail to find valid occurrences. The program only checks for occurrences directly adjacent to each other based on the `p` array, which may not accurately reflect the requirement that occurrences can be non-contiguous as long as they maintain the order and quantity specified in `s`.

2. **Handling Overlapping Matches**: The program does not seem to account for overlapping matches. For instance, consider `t` as `3-a 2-b` and `s` as `1-a 1-b`. The program would count the first `a` and `b`, but it might miss out on counting overlapping occurrences properly.

### Example of Failure:
Let's consider an input case:
```
Input:
4 2
2-a 2-b 2-a 2-b
1-a 1-b
```
Expected output is `3`, since the sequence `ab` can be found starting at position 1, 3, and 5 in the expanded form `aabbaabb`.

However, analyzing `func_2`, the logic may not correctly identify all valid occurrences due to how it processes the blocks and checks conditions. The match counting logic may skip over valid occurrences.

### Conclusion:
Given the possible edge cases and the identified flaws in the matching logic, the program may not function as intended for all inputs specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
