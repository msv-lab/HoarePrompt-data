To evaluate the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the program logic and see if it accurately counts the occurrences of the compressed string `s` within the compressed string `t`.

The program consists of two main functions:
1. `func_1(ar)`: This function takes a list of compressed string segments (in the format `li-ci`) and converts these segments into a more manageable form, essentially merging consecutive segments with the same character. The result is a list of pairs where the first element is the length of the segment and the second element is the character.

2. `func_2(t, s, c)`: This function counts the occurrences of the compressed string `s` in the compressed string `t`. It handles cases where `s` has one or two segments differently. For longer sequences, it employs an algorithm that appears to relate to the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) string matching algorithm.

### Potential Issues
1. **Single-character matching**: If the compressed string `s` consists of characters that do not appear in `t`, the function may not handle this correctly. For instance, if `t = "3-a 2-b"` and `s = "1-c"`, it should return `0`, but it is not clear if this case is explicitly handled in the logic.

2. **Counting logic**: The counting of occurrences seems to depend on the length of the segments and whether they match. If there are multiple segments in `s`, the algorithm's ability to correctly identify overlapping occurrences may not be guaranteed.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The algorithm seems to rely on the lengths and characters being perfectly aligned without checking for cases where segments from `s` might not be fully contained in `t`. For example, if `t` ends with a segment that is partially overlapping with the start of `s`, the logic might fail to count this as a valid occurrence.

### Example Case
Consider an input where `t = "3-a 2-b"` and `s = "1-b 1-a"`:
- The expected output should be `0` since there is no way to find "b" followed by "a" in the compressed representation of `t`. However, the program might count this incorrectly due to its logic for matching segments.

### Conclusion
Given these potential issues and the need for precise matching of the segments, the program does not account for all edge cases and may yield incorrect results in various scenarios.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **False**.
