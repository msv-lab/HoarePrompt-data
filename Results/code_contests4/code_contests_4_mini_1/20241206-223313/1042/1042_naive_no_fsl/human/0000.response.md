To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find out how many distinct photobooks can be formed by inserting one extra photo (from 'a' to 'z') into an existing string of photos represented by lowercase letters. 

1. **Understanding Distinct Photobooks**:
   - For a given string of length `n`, inserting a photo can occur at `n + 1` positions (before the first character, between characters, and after the last character).
   - Each of the positions can have any of the 26 photos (from 'a' to 'z').
   - The total potential combinations would be `(n + 1) * 26`.
   - However, we need to subtract the cases where the inserted photo is already present in the original string, as they would not result in new distinct photobooks.

2. **Calculating Distinct Photobooks**:
   - If we insert a photo that already exists in the original string, we would not get a distinct book; hence we need to count how many unique characters are in the original string.
   - The correct calculation for distinct photobooks would be:
     \[
     \text{distinct photobooks} = (n + 1) \times 26 - \text{number of unique characters in } s
     \]

### Code Analysis
Given code:
```python
n = raw_input()
print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
```

1. `len(n) + 1` correctly calculates the number of possible insertion positions.
2. The multiplication by `26` accounts for inserting each of the 26 characters.
3. However, `len(n)` only counts the length of the input string, which does not account for the unique characters in the string. This is the flaw in the logic.

### Checking with Examples
- For the input 'a':
  - The expected output is `51` (from the explanation).
  - The code calculates: 
    \[
    (1 + 1) \times 26 - 1 = 2 \times 26 - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51 \text{ (correct)}
    \]
  
- For the input 'hi':
  - The expected output is `76`.
  - The code calculates: 
    \[
    (2 + 1) \times 26 - 2 = 3 \times 26 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76 \text{ (correct)}
    \]
  
However, let's test a case with duplicate characters:
- For the input 'aa':
  - The expected output should be `51` because we can insert 'a' and it will not create a new distinct photobook.
  - The code calculates:
    \[
    (2 + 1) \times 26 - 2 = 3 \times 26 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76 \text{ (incorrect)}
    \]

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle cases where the original string has duplicate characters, leading to incorrect outputs. 

Thus, the correctness is:
Correctness: **False**
