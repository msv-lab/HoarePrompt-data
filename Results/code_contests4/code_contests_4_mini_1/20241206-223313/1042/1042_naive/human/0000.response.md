The provided program is supposed to calculate the number of distinct photobooks that can be formed by inserting one extra photo into an existing photobook, which is represented by the string `s`.

Let's analyze the program:
```python
n = raw_input()
print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
```

### Breakdown of the logic:
1. `len(n) + 1` calculates the number of positions available to insert a new photo. Since `s` has a length of `len(n)`, there are `len(n) + 1` possible insertion points (before the first character, between characters, and after the last character).
2. `* 26` is intended to account for the 26 possible characters (from 'a' to 'z') that can be inserted in any of those positions.
3. Finally, `- len(n)` subtracts the original length of the string `n`, which seems to be an attempt to avoid counting the original photobook as a distinct option after inserting a character.

### Evaluation of the program:
1. The program does not correctly compute the number of distinct photobooks because it fails to account for the fact that inserting a character that already exists in the book may not produce a new distinct photobook. For example, if the input is "aa", inserting another 'a' will not create a new distinct photobook.
2. The formula `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` is incorrect as it does not consider duplicates properly. It simply calculates the total possible insertions and assumes all lead to distinct outcomes without taking into account the existing characters.

### Example case to demonstrate the incorrectness:
- For the input "aa":
  - The expected distinct photobooks that can be made are:
    - Insert 'a': "aaa"
    - Insert 'b': "aba"
    - Insert 'c': "aca"
    - ...
    - Insert 'z': "aza"
  - Total distinct photobooks = 27 (one for each letter including 'a' which produces a duplicate).

However, the program would output:
- Calculation: `(2 + 1) * 26 - 2 = 3 * 26 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76`
- The output of 76 is incorrect.

Thus, due to the flaws in handling duplicates, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
