The code calculates the expression `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)`. Here, `n` is an input string whose length can vary. The length of `n` affects the calculation, while `s` remains unchanged.

1. `len(n)` retrieves the length of the input string `n`.
2. This length is then increased by 1.
3. The result is multiplied by 26.
4. Finally, the length of `n` is subtracted from the product.

Since the length of `n` is not specified, we will denote it as `len(n)` for the output state.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 20, inclusive; the result is `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)`**
