The given program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This would result in a runtime error if executed in a Python 3 environment.
   
2. **Logic for Counting Distinct Photobooks**:
   - The formula `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` does not correctly calculate the number of distinct photobooks that can be formed by inserting one additional photo. 
   - The intended logic should consider that for each position in the string (including before the first character and after the last character), an additional photo can be inserted. Since there are 26 possible photos (from 'a' to 'z'), for each of the `len(n) + 1` positions, you can insert any of the 26 letters.
   - The correct formula should be `26 * (len(n) + 1)`, as this counts each possible insertion point multiplied by the number of possible photos.

3. **Output**:
   - The program currently prints the result directly instead of returning it, which may not conform to expected output formats in all cases.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect logic and potential input handling issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
