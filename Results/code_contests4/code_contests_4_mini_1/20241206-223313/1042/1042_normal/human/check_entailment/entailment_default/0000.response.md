The provided program attempts to solve the problem of counting distinct photo books that can be created by inserting one extra photo into an existing booklet represented by a string of lowercase letters. 

Looking at the program:

```python
n = raw_input()
print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
```

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `n` that represents the current photo booklet.
2. **Calculation**: It calculates the number of distinct photo books by using the formula `(length of the input string + 1) * 26 - length of the input string`.

Now, evaluating the formula:
- `(length of the input string + 1) * 26` counts the total positions where a new photo can be inserted (including before the first character and after the last character) multiplied by the 26 possible photos to insert (from 'a' to 'z').
- The subtraction of `len(n)` presumably aims to exclude the cases where the new photo is the same as one of the existing photos, but this is incorrectly applied.

### Edge Cases:
- Consider the input `n = "a"`: The expected output is 51 (counting all combinations of inserting a letter from 'a' to 'z' at 2 positions). The program calculates `(1 + 1) * 26 - 1 = 51`, which is correct.
- For `n = "hi"`: The expected output is 76. The program calculates `(2 + 1) * 26 - 2 = 78`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the duplicate cases correctly.

### Output Hints:
The output hints do not clarify that the formula misses the distinct combinations when inserting the same character that already exists in the string. This results in inaccuracies.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fully adhere to the problem description: it fails to correctly calculate the number of distinct photobooks due to incorrect handling of cases where the inserted photo is the same as one already present in the booklet. The output hints do not provide reassurance that the program is correct, as they do not consider these duplicates accurately.

Correctness: **False**.
