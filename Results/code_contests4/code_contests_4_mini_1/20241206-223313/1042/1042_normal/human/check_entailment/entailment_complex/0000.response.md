The provided program aims to compute the number of distinct photobooks that can be made by inserting one extra photo into an existing photobook represented by the string `s`. Let's analyze the program in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have 26 photos labeled from "a" to "z".
- We want to insert one photo into a given photobook (string `s`).
- The goal is to count how many distinct photobooks can be formed by inserting one additional photo at any position in `s`.

### Key Points from the Problem:
1. The input is a string `s` of lowercase letters.
2. The output should be the number of distinct photobooks that can be created by inserting one photo from "a" to "z" at any position in `s`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program reads a string `s` from input.
2. It calculates the value using the formula: `(length of the input string + 1) * 26 - length of the input string`.

### Breakdown of the Formula:
- The length of the string `s` is denoted as `|s|`.
- When we insert one photo, we can do so in `|s| + 1` positions (before the first character, between characters, and after the last character).
- Each of these positions can have any of the 26 letters (photos) inserted.
- Thus, the total combinations would be `(|s| + 1) * 26`.
- However, the formula subtracts `|s|`, which does not align with the intended computation, as it does not account for duplicates appropriately.

### Example Verification:
1. For `s = "a"`:
   - Expected distinct photobooks: 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', ..., 'az', 'ba', ..., 'za' (total = 51).
   - The program computes: `(1 + 1) * 26 - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51`. This is correct.
   
2. For `s = "hi"`:
   - Expected distinct photobooks: 76.
   - The program computes: `(2 + 1) * 26 - 2 = 3 * 26 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76`. This is also correct.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the calculations and logic, the program indeed computes the correct number of distinct photobooks by inserting one additional photo into the existing string `s`. The formula, despite being non-standard, effectively captures the required count without overcounting.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
