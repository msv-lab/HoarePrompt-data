To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code step by step.

### Problem Understanding

The game involves a sequence of integers where:
1. Choosing an element `ak` earns `ak` points.
2. When `ak` is chosen, all occurrences of `ak`, `ak + 1`, and `ak - 1` are removed from the sequence.
3. The objective is to maximize the total points collected.

### Given Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of integers `n` and the sequence of integers `a`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - It creates a frequency array `freq` to count occurrences of each number in the sequence.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points that can be achieved using numbers up to `i`.
   - The logic used in the dynamic programming approach is:
     - `dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i)`
       - `dp[i - 1]` means not taking the current number `i`.
       - `dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i` means taking the current number `i`, thus removing `i - 1` and `i` from consideration.

### Checking for Edge Cases

1. **Minimum Input Size**:
   - For `n = 1` and the sequence `[1]`, the program should return `1`, which it does correctly.

2. **Consecutive Numbers**:
   - For the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly calculates the maximum points as `4` (by taking `2`).

3. **Large Gaps**:
   - Consider the sequence `[1, 3, 4, 5]`. The correct maximum should be `8` (taking `4` gives `4` points and removes `3` and `5`, leaving `1` which gives no points). The program should correctly compute this.

4. **Repeated Numbers**:
   - In the case of `[1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, the program should yield `10`, which it does correctly. 

5. **Higher Range Values**:
   - For a sequence like `[100000]`, the output should be `100000`, which is also handled correctly by the program.

### Conclusion

After assessing the program against potential edge cases, it appears that the logic used is effective in computing the maximum points based on the rules given in the problem description. There are no inputs where the program fails to give the expected results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to maximize the points while following the outlined rules for element removal.
