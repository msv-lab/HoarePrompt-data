To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step to see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to maximize points by strategically removing elements from a list. When an element \( a_k \) is removed, all occurrences of \( a_k \), \( a_k + 1 \), and \( a_k - 1 \) must also be removed. The points earned for removing \( a_k \) is equal to the value of \( a_k \) multiplied by its frequency in the list.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) and a sequence of \( n \) integers.
   - It uses a frequency array `freq` to count occurrences of each integer in the list \( a \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points that can be earned using numbers from 1 to \( i \).
   - The recurrence relation used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = \max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + \text{freq}[i] \times i)
     \]
   - This logic effectively decides whether to take the points from the current integer \( i \) (which also requires skipping \( i-1 \)) or to skip it and retain the maximum points from \( i-1 \).

3. **Final Output**:
   - The result is printed as `dp[n]`, which represents the maximum points achievable with the integers present in the list.

### Correctness Verification
- The approach used in the program correctly implements the logic required to maximize points based on the given game rules. The dynamic programming method ensures that the points are maximized while respecting the constraints of removing adjacent integers.
- The program correctly handles the input constraints and efficiently computes the maximum points by utilizing a frequency count and a dynamic programming approach.

### Conclusion
The program follows the problem description and correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It efficiently computes the maximum points Alex can earn based on the rules provided.

Correctness: **True**
