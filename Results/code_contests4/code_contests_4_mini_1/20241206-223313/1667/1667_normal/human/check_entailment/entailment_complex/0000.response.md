To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program operates and whether it aligns with the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A sequence of integers where the player can delete an integer `ak` and all instances of `ak + 1` and `ak - 1` from the sequence.
2. **Points**: The player earns points equal to the integer `ak` for each instance deleted.
3. **Goal**: Maximize the total points earned.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Frequency Calculation**: The program first calculates the frequency of each integer in the input list `a`. This is done using the `freq` list, where `freq[k]` counts how many times `k` appears in `a`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array `dp`**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the maximum points:
   - `dp[i]` represents the maximum points that can be obtained considering integers up to `i`.
   - The recursive relation used is:
     - `dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i)`
     - This means that for each integer `i`, the program either chooses not to take `i` (thus inheriting the points from `i - 1`) or takes `i` (thus adding its contribution multiplied by its frequency to the best result excluding `i - 1`).

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer and utilizes dynamic programming to ensure that no adjacent integers are chosen (since deleting `ak` also removes `ak + 1` and `ak - 1`).
- The logic of the dynamic programming table (`dp`) is sound and adheres to the requirements of maximizing points while considering the constraints posed by adjacent integers.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, as it effectively calculates the maximum points Alex can earn by strategically choosing integers and accounting for the deletions of adjacent values.

### Final Statement:
Correctness: **True**
