The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(ti())`, where `ti()` reads a line from standard input and strips it. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, the output state will reflect that `n` now holds the integer value obtained from the input. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it; `ma` is a lambda function that maps `fxn` over the result of splitting the input from `ti`; `ol` is a function that formats and outputs an array of integers as a space-separated string followed by a newline; `os` is a lambda function that outputs an integer followed by a newline; `olws` is a lambda function that writes an array of integers as a space-separated string followed by a newline.**
