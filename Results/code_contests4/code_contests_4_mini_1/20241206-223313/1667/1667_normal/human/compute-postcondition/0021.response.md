To evaluate the impact of the code `dp.append(max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i))`, we need to consider the values of the affected variables.

1. **Variables Involved**:
   - `dp[i - 1]`: This refers to the value of the `dp` list at index `i - 1`, which is `dp[3]`.
   - `dp[i - 2]`: This refers to the value of the `dp` list at index `i - 2`, which is `dp[2]`.
   - `freq[i]`: This refers to the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, specifically `freq[4]` since `i` is 4.
   - `i`: The variable `i` is given as 4.

2. **Calculating the New Value to Append**:
   - We calculate `dp[3]` and `dp[2] + freq[4] * 4`.
   - The new value to append is the maximum of these two computed values.

3. **Appending to `dp`**:
   - The value computed from the `max()` function is appended to the list `dp`.

Since we do not have specific values for `dp[3]`, `dp[2]`, or `freq[4]`, we cannot state exact numerical values but can articulate the relationship based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`dp` is updated by appending the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2] + freq[4] * 4`.**
