According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. After this iteration, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
