The variable `a` is assigned the value of `ma(int, ti())`. This means that `ti()` is called, which reads a line from standard input and strips it of leading and trailing whitespace. The resulting string is then split into a list of strings. The `ma` function then applies the `int` function to each element of this list, converting them into integers. Since `n` is an integer from input and `a` is a list of `n` integers, the output state will depend on the input provided to `ti()`.

If, for example, the input is "1 2 3", then `a` would be assigned the value `[1, 2, 3]`. However, since we are not given specific input values, we cannot determine the exact contents of `a`. We can state that `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ti()` reads a line from standard input; `ma` maps `int` over the split input.**
