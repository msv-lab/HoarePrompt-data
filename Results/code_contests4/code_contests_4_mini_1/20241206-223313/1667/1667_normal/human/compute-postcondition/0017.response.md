The code appends to the list `dp` the maximum value between `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i`. Given that `i` is 2, we have `dp[1]` and `dp[0]` to consider. The value of `freq[i]` is the count of occurrences of integer `i` (which is 2) in the list `a`. Therefore, `freq[2] * 2` gives the total contribution of integer 2 based on its frequency in the list.

Since the exact previous values of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]` are not provided, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`freq` is a list where `freq[k]` is the count of occurrences of integer `k` in the list `a`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2; `dp` is updated by appending max(dp[1], dp[0] + freq[2] * 2)**
