Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100000; `ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it; `ma` is a lambda function that maps `fxn` over the result of splitting the input from `ti`; `ol` is a function that formats and outputs an array of integers as a space-separated string followed by a newline; `os` is a lambda function that outputs an integer followed by a newline.**
