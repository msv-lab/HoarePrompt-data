The code snippet defines a lambda function `ol` that takes an array `arr` as input. This function uses `stdout.write` to convert each element of `arr` to a string, joins them with spaces, and appends a newline character at the end. The previous values of `n`, `a`, `ti`, and `ma` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `ol` will be used to format output when called with an array.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100000; `ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it; `ma` is a lambda function that maps `fxn` over the result of splitting the input from `ti`; `ol` is a function that formats and outputs an array of integers as a space-separated string followed by a newline.**
