According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n + 1`, which means it can execute while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Since `n` is at least 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 4. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a fourth time, `n` must be at least 4. 

State: **`freq` is a list where `freq[k]` is the count of occurrences of integer `k` in the list `a`, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 4; `dp` is updated by appending `max(dp[2], dp[1] + freq[3] * 3)**
