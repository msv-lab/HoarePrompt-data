The value of `e1` is assigned based on the expression `n - a - 1001`. Given that `a` is 0, the expression simplifies to `n - 1001`. Since `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, the value of `n - 1001` can be between -1001 and 2999. 

If `n - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0, `e1` will be assigned that value. If `n - 1001` is less than 0, `e1` will be assigned -1. Therefore, `e1` can either be a non-negative integer (if `n >= 1001`) or -1 (if `n < 1001`).

The output state reflects both conditions. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `a` is 0; `e1` is either a non-negative integer (if `n >= 1001`) or -1 (if `n < 1001)`**.
