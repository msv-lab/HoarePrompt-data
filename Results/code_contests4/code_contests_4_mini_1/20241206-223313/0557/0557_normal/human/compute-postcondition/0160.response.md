To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the code:

1. The variable `count` has two possible values:
   - If `nab < 1000`, then `count` is `2 * nab + 1`.
   - If `nab >= 1000`, then `count` is `2001`.

2. The code `count += ran` means that we are adding the value of `ran` to `count`. However, since the value of `ran` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the final value of `count`.

3. The value of `count` will change depending on the value of `ran`, but we can state that `count` is increased by `ran`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the potential values of `count` and mentions the change:

Output State: **`count` is either `2 * nab + 1` if `nab < 1000` or `2001` if `nab >= 1000; count is increased by ran.**
