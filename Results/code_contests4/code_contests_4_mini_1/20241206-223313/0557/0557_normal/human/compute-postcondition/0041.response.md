Postcondition: ***`count` is the total sum accumulated based on valid `ran` values, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is `n`, `e1` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `ran` is either `nab` (if `nab < 1000`) or `2001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`). Additionally, `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.***
