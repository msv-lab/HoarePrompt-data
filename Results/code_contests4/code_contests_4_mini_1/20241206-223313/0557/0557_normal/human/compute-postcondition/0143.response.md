The expression for `ran` is calculated based on the value of `nab`. The value of `nab` is `e1`. Depending on whether `nab` (which is `e1`) is less than or greater than 1000, the value of `ran` will be determined by one of the two expressions:

1. If `nab < 1000`, then `ran = nab - (-1)`, which simplifies to `ran = nab + 1`.
2. If `nab > 1000`, then `ran = nab - (nab - 1001)`, which simplifies to `ran = 1001`.

Since `nab` is `e1`, the value of `ran` will either be `e1 + 1` if `e1 < 1000`, or `1001` if `e1 > 1000`. The variable `count` remains adjusted based on the value of `ran`, but the specifics of that adjustment are not provided.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `e1`. If we consider both scenarios for clarity, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`nab` is `e1`; `ran` is either `e1 + 1` (if `e1 < 1000`) or `1001` (if `e1 > 1000)`; `count` remains adjusted based on `ran`.**
