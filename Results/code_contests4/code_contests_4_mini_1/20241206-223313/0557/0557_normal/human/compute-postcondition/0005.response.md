According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0, since `xrange` will generate numbers from 0 up to `(n if n < 1000 else 1000)`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, the loop will execute for values of `a` from 0 to 1000 irrespective of the specific value of `n`. 

At the start of the loop, `a` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` is a positive integer (which it is by definition).
- `a` is now 0, which is the starting value for the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
