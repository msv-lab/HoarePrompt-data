Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `count` is the accumulated value based on all iterations of the loop, `ans[n]` is assigned the final value of `count`, `a` is at most 1000, `e1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer depending on the value of `n`, and `ran` is derived from the values of `nab` during the iterations of the inner loop.**
