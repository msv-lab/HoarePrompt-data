`ans` is assigned a list containing 4001 elements, all initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` and the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers in the range 0 to 1000 such that a + b + c + d = n; `ans` is a list of 4001 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers in the range 0 to 1000 such that a + b + c + d = n; `ans` is a list of 4001 zeros.**
