The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple datasets where each dataset consists of four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that satisfy the condition `a + b + c + d = n`, with `n` being a positive integer less than or equal to 4000. The number of datasets does not exceed 50. The function does not return a specific value or output as described in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and processes datasets of non-negative integers a, b, c, and d that sum to a positive integer n (â‰¤ 4000), with a maximum of 50 datasets.**
