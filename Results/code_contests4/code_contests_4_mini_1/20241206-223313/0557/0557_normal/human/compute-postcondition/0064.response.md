Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `count` is 0; `ans[n]` is 0; `a` is 0; `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1001; `nab` is `n`; `ran` is either `n + 1` (if `n < 1000`), `1001` (if `n == 1000`), or `2001 - n` (if `n > 1000`). The value of `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.***
