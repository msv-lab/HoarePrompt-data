The value of `count` is incremented by `ran`. The value of `ran` depends on `n`: if `n < 1001`, then `ran` is equal to `n`; if `n >= 1001`, then `ran` is equal to `2002 - n`. Since `ran` is always greater than or equal to 0, the value of `count` will increase by a non-negative amount based on the value of `ran`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible values of `count` after this increment. 

Output State: **`n` can have any value; `ran` is either `n` (if `n < 1001`) or `2002 - n` (if `n >= 1001`); `count` is increased by `ran`.**
