Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that `a + b + c + d = n`. If `ans[n]` is not assigned a value, `count` is the total sum accumulated based on valid `ran` values and `a` is at most 1000; `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`.***
