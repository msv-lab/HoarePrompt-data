To analyze the impact of the code, we first need to evaluate the conditions and the values of the relevant variables based on the initial state described.

1. The variable `a` is given as 2.
2. The variable `n` is a positive integer that is less than or equal to 4000.
3. The variable `e1` is computed using the expression `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001 >= 0`, otherwise it is assigned the value -1.

Now, let's break this down into two cases based on the value of `n` concerning the condition `n >= 1003`.

**Case 1: If n >= 1003**
- We will calculate `e1` as follows:
  - `e1 = n - 2 - 1001`
  - Therefore, `e1 = n - 1003`.
- In this case, `e1` will be a non-negative integer since `n` is at least 1003.

**Case 2: If n < 1003**
- In this case, we compute `e1` as follows:
  - Since `n - 2 - 1001 < 0`, `e1` will be assigned the value -1.

Given these scenarios, the output state will vary based on the value of `n`. However, regardless of the specific integer value of `n`, we can summarize the potential outcomes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `e1` is either `n - 1003` (if `n >= 1003`) or -1 (if `n < 1003)`**.
