Functionality: ** The function processes multiple datasets of non-negative integers, where the sum of four integers (a, b, c, and d) equals a positive integer n (â‰¤ 4000). It calculates and prints the total count of valid combinations for each n, based on specified conditions, without accepting any parameters. The function is designed to handle up to 50 datasets. However, it does not return any values; it only prints results for each dataset processed. **
