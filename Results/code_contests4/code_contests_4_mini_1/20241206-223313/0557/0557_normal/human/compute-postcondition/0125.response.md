Postcondition: ***`count` is either `2n + 1` or `1001 + n` if `n < 1001`, or `2003` or `3003 - n` if `n >= 1001; `ran` is either `n` if `n < 1001` or `2002 - n` if `n >= 1001; `n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is 0, `e1` is either `n - 1001` or -1, and `nab` is `n - 1`. If `ran` is non-negative, the values of `count` and `ran` are updated accordingly based on the conditions provided.***
