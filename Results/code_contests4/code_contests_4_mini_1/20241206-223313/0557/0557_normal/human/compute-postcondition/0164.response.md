Output State: **`count` is the sum of all valid `ran` values calculated during the iterations; `n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `a` is at most 1000; `e1` is `n - 1001` if `n >= 1001` or -1 if `n < 1001`; `nab` will be `e1` if `n >= 1001`; `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`.**
