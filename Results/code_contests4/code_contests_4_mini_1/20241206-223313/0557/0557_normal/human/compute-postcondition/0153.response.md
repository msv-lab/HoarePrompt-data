Postcondition: ***`count` is the sum of `ran` calculated from the iterations based on `n` where `ran` is either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`) or `2001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`). If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is increased by `ran`. If `ran` is less than 0, `count` remains unchanged.***
