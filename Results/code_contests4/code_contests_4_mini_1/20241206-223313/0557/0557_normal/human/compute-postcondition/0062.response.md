To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop structure and the state before the loop.

The loop is defined as follows: 
```
for nab in xrange(n - a, e1, -1):
```

1. The loop will iterate starting from `n - a` down to `e1`, decrementing by 1 each time.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting point (`n - a`) must be greater than or equal to `e1`.

Now, let's analyze the variables:
- `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000.
- `a` is initialized to 0, which means `n - a` equals `n`.
- `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1001` depending on the value of `n`. 

Now consider the two cases for `e1`:
- If `e1` is -1, the loop will execute since `n` (which is positive) will always be greater than -1.
- If `e1` is `n - 1001`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to `e1`. This means `n` must be at least `n - 1001`, which is always true as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1001.

Thus, we can conclude:
- If `n` is between 1 and 1000, `e1` would be `n - 1001`, which is less than `n - a`, making the loop execute.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 1001, `e1` is `n - 1001`, and the loop will still execute as `n` will be greater than `e1`.

For the loop to execute properly:
- We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 (which it already is since it is a positive integer), and `e1` should be set based on `n`.

To summarize, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `e1` must be calculated based on `n`, and in any case, it is either -1 or `n - 1001`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `count` is 0, `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`, `a` is 0, `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1001, for the loop to execute the first time nab is n - a (which is n), and e1 is set accordingly**.
