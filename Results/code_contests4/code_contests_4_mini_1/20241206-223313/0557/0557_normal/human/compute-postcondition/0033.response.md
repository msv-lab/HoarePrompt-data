The expression for `ran` is calculated based on the value of `nab`. Since `nab` is -1, we evaluate the conditions:

1. `nab < 1000` is true (since -1 < 1000), so we take `nab`, which is -1.
2. `nab > 1000` is false (since -1 is not greater than 1000), so we take -1 from the second part.

Now substituting these values into the expression for `ran`:

```
ran = (-1) - (-1 - 1001)
ran = -1 - (-1002)
ran = -1 + 1002
ran = 1001
```

Thus, `ran` is updated to 1001. The other variable `count` is updated by `ran`, but the initial value of `count` is not provided, so we can only state that `count` is now incremented by `ran`.

Output State: **`count` is updated by `ran`, which is 1001; `nab` is -1**
