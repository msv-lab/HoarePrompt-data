To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000.
- `ran` is either `n + 1` (if `n < 1000`) or `2001 - n` (if `1000 <= n <= 4000`).
- Additionally, `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.

The code snippet `count += ran` means that the variable `count` will be incremented by the value of `ran`.

Now, let's consider the two cases for `ran` based on the value of `n`:

1. If `n < 1000`, then `ran = n + 1`.
2. If `1000 <= n <= 4000`, then `ran = 2001 - n`.

In both cases, `count` is incremented by `ran`, but we do not know the previous value of `count`. Therefore, we can describe the change without specifying an exact numeric value for `count`.

The output state will reflect the change in `count` based on the conditions for `ran`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `ran` is either `n + 1` (if `n < 1000`) or `2001 - n` (if `1000 <= n <= 4000); `count` is incremented by `ran`.**
