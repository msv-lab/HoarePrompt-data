The value of `e1` is assigned based on the expression `n - a - 1001`. Given that `a` is 0, this simplifies to `n - 1001`. The condition checks if this value is greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1001, then `e1` will be `n - 1001`. If `n` is less than 1001, `e1` will be assigned the value -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is 0, and `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or -1 (if `n < 1001`).

Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is 0, and `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or -1 (if `n < 1001`).**
