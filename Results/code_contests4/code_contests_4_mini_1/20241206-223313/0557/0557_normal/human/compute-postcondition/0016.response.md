According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nab`, `n`, and `a`. The loop iterates while `nab` is greater than or equal to `e1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000,
- `nab` is calculated as `n - a - 1`,
- the loop is set to iterate from `n - a` down to `e1` (exclusive).

Since `nab` is `n - a - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `nab` must be decremented by 1. 

Thus, the next value of `nab` will be `nab - 1`, which equals `n - a - 2`. The loop will continue as long as `nab - 1` is still greater than or equal to `e1`. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect:
- `nab` updated to `n - a - 2` and for the loop to execute again, `n - a - 2` must be greater than or equal to `e1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `nab` is `n - a - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `n - a - 2` must be greater than or equal to `e1`.**
