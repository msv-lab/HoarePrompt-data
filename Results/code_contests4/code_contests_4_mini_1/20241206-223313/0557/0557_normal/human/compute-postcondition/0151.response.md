Postcondition: ***`count` is the sum of `ran` calculated from the iterations based on `n`; `nab` is `n - (k + 1)`; `n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `e1` is either `n - (k + 1) - 1001` or `-1`; `ran` is either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`) or `2001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`); and `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.***
