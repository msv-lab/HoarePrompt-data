Postcondition: ***`count` is either `n + 1` (if `n < 1000`) or `1001` (if `n >= 1000`), `n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1001` if `n >= 1001` or -1 if `n < 1001`, `nab` is `n`, and `ran` is either `nab + 1` if `nab < 1000` or `1001` if `nab >= 1000`, provided that `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.***
