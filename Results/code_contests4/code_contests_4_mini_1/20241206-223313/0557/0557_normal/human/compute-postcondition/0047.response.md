Postcondition: ***`count` is the total sum accumulated based on valid `ran` values. If `ran` is non-negative, `count` is incremented by `ran`, where `ran` can be either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`), `1001` (if `nab == 1000`), or `2001 - nab` (if `nab > 1000`); `nab` is defined as `n - a - 1`, which satisfies the loop condition `n - a - 1 >= e1`.***
