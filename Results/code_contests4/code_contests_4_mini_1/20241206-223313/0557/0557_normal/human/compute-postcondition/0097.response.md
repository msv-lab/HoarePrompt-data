Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `e1` is either `n - 1003` (if `n >= 1003`) or -1 (if `n < 1003); `nab` is `n - a` (where `a < 1003` if `n >= 1003` or `a <= n` if `n < 1003); `ran` is calculated based on the value of `nab`; `ran` is greater than or equal to 0; `count` is increased by `ran`.**
