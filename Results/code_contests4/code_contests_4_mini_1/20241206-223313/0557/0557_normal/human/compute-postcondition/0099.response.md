According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `n`, `a`, and `e1`. The loop will execute if `n - a` is greater than `e1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, and since the loop iterates from `n - a` down to `e1`, we need to ensure that `n - a - 1` is still greater than `e1` for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, if the loop executes one more time, the value of `nab` will decrease by 1 in the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, for the loop to execute a second time `n - a` must be greater than `e1`, nab will be `n - a - 1`.**
