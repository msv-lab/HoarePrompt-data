The code assigns a value to `e1` based on the condition involving `n`, `a`, and a constant (1001). The calculation for `e1` is derived from the expression `n - a - 1001`. Given that `a` is 0, this simplifies to `n - 1001`. The value of `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, so `n - 1001` will either be greater than or equal to 0 or less than -1. 

If `n` is less than or equal to 1001, `e1` will be assigned -1. If `n` is greater than 1001, `e1` will be assigned the value of `n - 1001`.

Thus, depending on the value of `n`, the output state will vary:

- If `n` â‰¤ 1001, then `e1` = -1.
- If `n` > 1001, then `e1` = `n - 1001`.

Therefore, the Output State can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `count` is 0, `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`, `a` is 0, `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1001 depending on the value of `n`.**
