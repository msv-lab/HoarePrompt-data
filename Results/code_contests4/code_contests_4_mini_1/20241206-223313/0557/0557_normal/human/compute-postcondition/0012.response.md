According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `n`, `a`, and `e1`. The loop will execute as long as `n - a` is greater than `e1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, and `n - a` is the starting point of the loop. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n - a` must be greater than `e1`. If `n - a` is equal to `e1` after the current iteration, then the loop will not execute again. Assuming that the loop has executed at least once, the value of `nab` would have decreased by 1 for each iteration. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we decrement `nab` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `nab` would be `n - a - 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `nab` is `n - a - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n - a` must be greater than `e1`.**
