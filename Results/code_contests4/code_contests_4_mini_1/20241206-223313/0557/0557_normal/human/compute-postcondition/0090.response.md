Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `ran` is either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`) or `1001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000); `count` has been increased by `ran`; `nab` must be greater than `e1` for the loop to execute a second time; if `ran` is non-negative, the conditions regarding `n`, `ran`, `count`, and `nab` are maintained.***
