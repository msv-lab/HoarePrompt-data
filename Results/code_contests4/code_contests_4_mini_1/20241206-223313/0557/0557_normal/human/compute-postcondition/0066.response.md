Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is either `n + 1` (if `n < 1000`), `1001` (if `n == 1000`), or `2001 - n` (if `n > 1000`); `ans[n]` is 0; `a` is 0; `e1` is either -1 or `n - 1001`; `nab` is `n`; `ran` is either `n + 1`, `1001`, or `2001 - n`.***
