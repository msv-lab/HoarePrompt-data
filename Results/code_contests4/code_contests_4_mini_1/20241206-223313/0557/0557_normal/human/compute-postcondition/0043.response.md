Postcondition: ***`count` is the total sum accumulated based on valid `ran` values. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `ran` is either `nab` (if `nab < 1000`) or `2001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000`). The variables `n`, `a`, and `e1` retain their values as a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `n`, and 0, respectively.***
