Postcondition: ***`count` can take values of either `3n - 1` or `999 + 2n` if `n < 1002`; or `4006 - n` or `4006 - 2n` if `n >= 1002`. `ran` is either `n - 2` if `n < 1002` or `2003 - n` if `n >= 1002`. Additionally, `n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` remains 0, and `e1` is either `n - 1001` or -1 while `nab` is `n - 2`. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, the values of `count` and `ran` are updated as described.***
