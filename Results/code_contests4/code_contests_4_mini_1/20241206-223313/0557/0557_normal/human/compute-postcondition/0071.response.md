According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `n`, `a`, and `e1`. The loop will execute as long as `n - a` is greater than `e1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000. For the loop to execute one more time:

1. We calculate the next value of `nab`, which will be `n - a - 1` since the loop iterates downwards (due to `-1` in the `xrange`).
2. For the loop to execute again, `n - a - 1` must still be greater than `e1`.

Thus, `n - a` must be greater than `e1` for the loop to execute again, meaning `n - a - 1` must also be greater than `e1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `nab` is `n - a - 1`, for the loop to execute again `n - a` must be greater than `e1`.**
