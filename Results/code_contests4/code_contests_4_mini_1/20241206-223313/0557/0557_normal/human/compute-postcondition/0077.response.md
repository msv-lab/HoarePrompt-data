The variable `e1` is assigned the value of `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, it is assigned -1. The value of `a` is 1, so we can simplify the expression to `n - 1 - 1001` or `n - 1002`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, we can analyze the scenarios:

1. If `n` is at least 1002, then `e1` will be `n - 1002`.
2. If `n` is less than 1002, then `e1` will be -1.

Thus, based on the value of `n`, `e1` can either be calculated as `n - 1002` (if `n >= 1002`) or -1 (if `n < 1002`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `count` is the accumulated value; `ans[n]` is 0; `a` is 1; `e1` is either `n - 1002` (if `n >= 1002`) or -1 (if `n < 1002`).**
