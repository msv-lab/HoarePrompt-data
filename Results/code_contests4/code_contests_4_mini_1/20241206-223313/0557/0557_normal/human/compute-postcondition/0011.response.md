Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000. If `ran` is non-negative (which occurs when `n < 1000` and `ran = n + 1`, or when `n >= 1001` and `ran = 2001 - n`), then `count` is incremented by `ran`. If `ran` is negative, which would occur if `n > 2000`, the condition is not satisfied and the `count` remains unchanged.***
