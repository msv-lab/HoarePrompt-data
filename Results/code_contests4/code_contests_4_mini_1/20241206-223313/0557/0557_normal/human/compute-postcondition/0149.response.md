To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop statement and the given state before the loop starts. 

The loop statement is:

```
for nab in xrange(n - a, e1, -1):
```

This loop will execute as long as the starting point `n - a` is greater than the endpoint `e1` and the step is negative (i.e., it decrements `nab`).

1. **Calculate the starting value**: 
   - The starting value of `nab` is `n - a`.
   - Since `a` is defined as `k + 1`, we have `n - a = n - (k + 1)`.

2. **Calculate the ending value**: 
   - The ending value for the loop is `e1`. 
   - `e1` is defined as either `n - a - 1001` (if `n - a - 1001 >= 0`) or `-1` (if `n - a - 1001 < 0`).

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n - a > e1`. 
   - Hence, we need to consider both cases for `e1`:
     - If `e1 = n - a - 1001`, then for the loop to execute, we need:
       ```
       n - a > n - a - 1001
       ```
       Simplifying this gives:
       ```
       0 > -1001, which is always true. 
       ```
       Therefore, this case does not affect the execution.
     - If `e1 = -1`, then for the loop to execute, we require:
       ```
       n - a > -1
       ```
       This translates to:
       ```
       n - (k + 1) > -1  â†’  n > k
       ```

4. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, we must ensure that `n > k`, which is a condition on the integer values. 
   - Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `nab` and ensure that `e1` is properly defined based on the value of `n`.

Based on this reasoning, we conclude that the state should reflect the condition for `n` and the values of `nab` and `e1`.

State: **`count` is the sum of ran calculated from the iterations based on `n`, `nab` is `n - (k + 1)`, `n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `e1` is either `n - (k + 1) - 1001` or `-1`, for the loop to execute `n > k`**.
