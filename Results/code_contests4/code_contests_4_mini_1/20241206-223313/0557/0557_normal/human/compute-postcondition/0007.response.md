According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the values of `n`, `a`, and `e1`. The loop will execute as long as the range defined by `xrange(n - a, e1, -1)` is valid. 

1. The starting point of the loop is `n - a`. Given that `a` is 0, this simplifies to `n`.
2. The endpoint of the loop is `e1`. 
3. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `e1`. 

Now, considering the conditions for `e1`:
- If `n >= 1001`, then `e1` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `e1`.
- If `n < 1001`, then `e1` is -1. Since `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `n` will always be greater than -1, so the loop will execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- If `n >= 1001`, we need `n` to be greater than `e1` (which is a non-negative integer).
- If `n < 1001`, the loop will execute because `n` is positive and greater than -1.

At the start of the loop:
- If `n >= 1001`, we need to know the value of `e1` to ensure that `n > e1` holds true.
- If `n < 1001`, `a` is still 0 and `e1` being -1 means the loop can execute.

To summarize, we need to ensure that:
- For `n >= 1001`, we need `e1` to be less than `n`.
- For `n < 1001`, the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is 0, `e1` is -1 if `n < 1001` or a non-negative integer less than `n` if `n >= 1001`**
