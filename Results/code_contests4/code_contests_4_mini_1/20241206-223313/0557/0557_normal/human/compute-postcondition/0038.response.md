The expression `e1 = n - a - 1001 if n - a - 1001 >= 0 else -1` assigns a value to `e1` based on the condition involving `n` and `a`. Here, `a` is equal to `n`. Thus, `n - a` equals 0. We can substitute `a` with `n` in the expression:

1. The condition becomes `n - n - 1001 >= 0`, which simplifies to `-1001 >= 0`. This condition is false.
2. Since the condition is false, `e1` is assigned the value `-1`.

The values of `count`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the total sum accumulated based on valid `ran` values, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is `n`, and `e1` is -1.

Output State: **`count` is the total sum accumulated based on valid `ran` values, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, `a` is `n`, `e1` is -1**.
