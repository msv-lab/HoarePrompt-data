To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the variables involved based on the initial state.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000.
   - `nab` is calculated as `n - a - 1`.
   - `ran` is defined based on the value of `nab`:
     - If `nab < 1000`, then `ran = nab + 1`.
     - If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran = 1001 - nab`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet `count += ran` means that the value of `ran` will be added to `count`.

3. **Impact of Code**:
   - The variable `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`.
   - The value of `count` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `count` after execution.
   - However, we can express the change in terms of `ran`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - Depending on the value of `nab`, `ran` can either be `nab + 1` or `1001 - nab`.
   - Thus, after executing the code, `count` will be increased by `ran`.

Given that we cannot determine the exact value of `count` but know it is increased by `ran`, the output state will summarize the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000; `nab` is `n - a - 1`; `ran` is either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`) or `1001 - nab` (if `nab >= 1000); `count` is increased by `ran`.**
