Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid positive integer less than or equal to 4000. If `ans[n]` is not already assigned, `count` is the sum of all valid `ran` values calculated during the iterations, `a` is at most 1000, and `e1` is determined as `n - 1001` if `n >= 1001` or -1 if `n < 1001`; `nab` will be set to `e1` if `n >= 1001`, and `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`.***
