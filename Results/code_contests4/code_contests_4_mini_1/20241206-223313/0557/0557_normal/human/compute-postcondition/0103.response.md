According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `nab` is greater than or equal to `e1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, and `nab` was updated in the last iteration to be `n - a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nab` must be decremented once more, so it will be `n - a - 1` in the next iteration. 

The condition for the loop execution is that `nab` must still be greater than or equal to `e1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n - a - 1` must be greater than or equal to `e1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, for the loop to execute a second time `nab` must be greater than or equal to `e1`, nab will be `n - a - 1`.**
