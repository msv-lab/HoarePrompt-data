Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of combinations of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a + b + c + d = n` for the range of `n` provided in the problem description. 

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Loop Bounds**: The program uses `xrange` and the bounds for the loops are not correctly set to ensure that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are all within the specified range of 0-1000. The current logic does not correctly iterate through all combinations of values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that satisfy the equation.

2. **Counting Combinations**: The algorithm attempts to count the combinations by manipulating the limits of iterations based on `n` and hardcoded values (like 1000 and 1001) which can lead to incorrect counts. The counting logic does not fit the requirement of finding all non-negative integer combinations for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

3. **Boundary Cases**: The program does not seem to handle cases where `n` is less than 4, which could lead to missing combinations. For example, for `n=2`, it should return 10, but the logic used may not reach that count correctly.

Overall, the program's logic does not align with the combinatorial problem described, where the requirements ask for an exhaustive search of valid combinations within defined limits. Hence, it fails to meet the problem description reliably.
