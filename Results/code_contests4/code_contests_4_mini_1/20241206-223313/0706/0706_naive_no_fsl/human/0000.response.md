To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the program itself.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We are given a sequence of integers and several queries characterized by pairs of integers (li, ri).
2. For each query, we need to find the sum of counts of numbers in the sequence that are divisible by each prime number in the range [li, ri].

### Key Steps in the Program:
- The program reads the input values, including the sequence of integers and the queries.
- It initializes arrays to keep track of the counts of occurrences of each integer, the number of integers divisible by each prime, and a cumulative sum of these counts.
- It processes the sequence to fill the `nos` array with counts of each integer.
- The program then identifies primes and counts how many integers in the sequence are divisible by each prime.
- Finally, it processes each query and outputs the results.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Prime Calculation**: The program does not explicitly implement a prime number sieve algorithm (like the Sieve of Eratosthenes) to identify primes up to a certain limit. The logic assumes that all divisible counts correspond correctly to prime numbers, which may not hold true for larger values of `li` and `ri`.
2. **Range Handling**: The handling of ranges in the query might lead to errors if `li` and `ri` go beyond the maximum integer in the sequence. If `ri` exceeds the maximum integer but has a prime greater than this maximum, the program will still use `primCount` which may not be correctly initialized for those prime values.
3. **Output for Non-Prime Ranges**: If the range [li, ri] contains no prime numbers, the program should output 0. While it seems to handle this implicitly, any logic flaws in prime detection will lead to incorrect outputs.

### Test Case Example:
Consider the input:
```
6
10 15 20 25 30 35
1
2 10
```
- The primes between 2 and 10 are {2, 3, 5, 7}. 
- The expected output should be `6` since:
  - f(2) = 3 (10, 20, 30)
  - f(3) = 2 (15, 30)
  - f(5) = 6 (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35)
  - f(7) = 0
  - Total = 3 + 2 + 6 + 0 = 11.

However, if the program does not correctly identify these primes due to the lack of a proper prime sieve or if it incorrectly initializes the `primCount`, the output might not be as expected.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic, it is clear that the program has a significant flaw regarding prime detection and handling of ranges potentially leading to incorrect results. 

**Correctness: False** 

The program does not guarantee correct outputs for all inputs as it lacks a proper mechanism to identify primes and manage queries correctly.
