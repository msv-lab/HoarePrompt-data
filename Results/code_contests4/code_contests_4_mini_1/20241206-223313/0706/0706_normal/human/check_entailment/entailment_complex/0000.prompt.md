You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, the bear started studying data structures and faced the following problem.

You are given a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn of length n and m queries, each of them is characterized by two integers li, ri. Let's introduce f(p) to represent the number of such indexes k, that xk is divisible by p. The answer to the query li, ri is the sum: <image>, where S(li, ri) is a set of prime numbers from segment [li, ri] (both borders are included in the segment).

Help the bear cope with the problem.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106). The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (2 ≤ xi ≤ 107). The numbers are not necessarily distinct.

The third line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50000). Each of the following m lines contains a pair of space-separated integers, li and ri (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·109) — the numbers that characterize the current query.

Output

Print m integers — the answers to the queries on the order the queries appear in the input.

Note

Consider the first sample. Overall, the first sample has 3 queries.

  1. The first query l = 2, r = 11 comes. You need to count f(2) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 9. 
  2. The second query comes l = 3, r = 12. You need to count f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 7. 
  3. The third query comes l = 4, r = 4. As this interval has no prime numbers, then the sum equals 0. 
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, the sequence of integers is a list of n integers where each integer xi satisfies 2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50000, and each query is characterized by two integers li and ri satisfying 2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1():
    return map(long, stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing long integers from the input read from stdin, which is a sequence of integers split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from standard input, splitting it into a sequence of integers, which it maps to long integers and returns as a map object. It does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to input format or values.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), x is a list of n integers where each integer xi (2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7) is not necessarily distinct, m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), and each query is characterized by two integers li and ri such that (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9).
def func_2(li):
    if (not li) :
        return
        #The program does not return any specific value or variable since the return statement is incomplete.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `xi` (2 ≤ `xi` ≤ 10^7) is not necessarily distinct, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 50,000), and each query is characterized by two integers `li` and `ri` such that (2 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ 2·10^9). The value of `li` is a truthy value (not zero)
    for i in xrange(len(li) - 1):
        stdout.write('%d ' % li[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), `li` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `li` minus 1.
    stdout.write('%d\n' % li[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `li` and, if the list is not empty, it prints each integer in the list followed by a space, and finally prints the last integer from the list followed by a newline. If `li` is empty, the function does nothing and returns no value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, the sequence of integers x contains n integers each in the range 2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50000, and each query is defined by a pair of integers li and ri where 2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_3():
    return stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a line of input read from standard input, which is a string with potential trailing newline removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string read from standard input, with any trailing newline character removed. It does not handle any edge cases related to invalid input or exceptions that may arise from reading input.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
