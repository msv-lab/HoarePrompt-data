Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails to address the following critical aspects:

1. **Prime Number Generation:** The problem requires generating a set of prime numbers within the range `[li, ri]` for each query. None of the functions provided in the code handle this requirement. There is no implementation for checking for prime numbers or generating them, which is essential for calculating the required sum of `f(p)`.

2. **Functionality of f(p):** The code is expected to calculate `f(p)`, which counts how many integers in the sequence are divisible by each prime number `p` in the range `[li, ri]`. Again, there is no function or logic present that implements this counting mechanism.

3. **Handling of Multiple Queries:** Although the code supports reading multiple queries, it does not process or respond to these queries according to the problem's requirements.

4. **Output of Results:** The problem description specifies that the output should be the results for each query in the order they appear. The code does not contain any mechanism to collect or print these results.

Given these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. For example, consider the query with `li = 2` and `ri = 11` from the first example; the code does not compute the prime numbers in this range or the corresponding values of `f(p)` as required.

Thus, the program is incomplete and incorrect based on the outlined criteria and requirements.
