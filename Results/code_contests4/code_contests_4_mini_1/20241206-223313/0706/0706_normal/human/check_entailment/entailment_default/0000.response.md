To evaluate the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the functions and their functionality step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to count how many integers in a sequence are divisible by prime numbers within given ranges for multiple queries.

### Function Analysis
1. **Function 1: `func_1()`**
   - Reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map object.
   - **Edge Cases:** It does not handle exceptions or validate input format or values.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(li)`**
   - Accepts a list of integers and prints them out. If the list is empty, it does nothing.
   - **Edge Cases:** None, although it could be improved to handle cases when `li` is not a list.

3. **Function 3: `func_3()`**
   - Reads input, processes the integer sequence, and computes cumulative counts of how many integers are divisible by prime numbers.
   - It sets up a sieve-like method to count occurrences of numbers and their divisibility.
   - In the queries, it restricts the range of primes based on the maximum number in the input, which is stored in `N`.

### Edge Cases in the Code
- **Input Constraints:** The function assumes all inputs are valid integers as per the problem description. If the input does not meet constraints (e.g., non-integer or out of bounds), it could lead to incorrect results or crashes.
- **Prime Counting:** The method for counting primes up to `N` and handling queries does not account for the scenario where no primes exist in the range `[li, ri]`. It would still return a number based on the cumulative counts, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Output Description Analysis
The output descriptions indicate that the functions read input and print results, but they do not cover potential flaws in input assumptions or cases where the input does not yield valid primes.

### Conclusion
The program fails to handle edge cases, particularly:
- Not validating input for integers.
- The handling of queries where `li` and `ri` may not yield any prime numbers, leading to potentially misleading results.

Thus, based on the analysis, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation:** The program does not account for situations where there are no primes in the specified range of a query, which can lead to incorrect outputs. For instance, for the query `(4, 4)`, if no primes exist, the output should be `0`, but the code could produce an incorrect count based on cumulative sums. Additionally, the lack of input validation could lead to errors in real usage scenarios.
