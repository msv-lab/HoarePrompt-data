Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is intended to read a sequence of integers from standard input, but it uses `map(long, stdin.readline().split())`, which is incorrect for Python 3 (since `long` does not exist in Python 3, and it should use `int`). Furthermore, this function does not handle the integers in any way related to the problem's requirements.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function seems to take an input `li`, which is not defined based on the problem description. Additionally, it does not perform any calculation related to the input array `x` or the queries to find prime numbers in the range `[li, ri]`. Instead, it just writes the elements of `li` to the output, which is irrelevant to the task.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function reads a line of input, but again, it does not relate to the core logic of the problem. There is no processing of the integers in the `x` sequence or handling of the queries, nor does it calculate the desired outputs based on the given conditions.

Overall, the program does not implement the logic needed to count divisors, identify prime numbers in a given range, or produce the correct output based on the problem's requirements. Therefore, it fails to meet the criteria set forth in the problem description.
