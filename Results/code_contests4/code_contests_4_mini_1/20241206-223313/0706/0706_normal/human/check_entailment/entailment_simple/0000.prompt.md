You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently, the bear started studying data structures and faced the following problem.

You are given a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn of length n and m queries, each of them is characterized by two integers li, ri. Let's introduce f(p) to represent the number of such indexes k, that xk is divisible by p. The answer to the query li, ri is the sum: <image>, where S(li, ri) is a set of prime numbers from segment [li, ri] (both borders are included in the segment).

Help the bear cope with the problem.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106). The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (2 ≤ xi ≤ 107). The numbers are not necessarily distinct.

The third line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50000). Each of the following m lines contains a pair of space-separated integers, li and ri (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·109) — the numbers that characterize the current query.

Output

Print m integers — the answers to the queries on the order the queries appear in the input.

Note

Consider the first sample. Overall, the first sample has 3 queries.

  1. The first query l = 2, r = 11 comes. You need to count f(2) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 9. 
  2. The second query comes l = 3, r = 12. You need to count f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 7. 
  3. The third query comes l = 4, r = 4. As this interval has no prime numbers, then the sum equals 0. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, the sequence of integers is a list of n integers where each integer xi satisfies 2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50000, and each query is characterized by two integers li and ri satisfying 2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1():
    return map(long, stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing long integers from the input read from stdin, which is a sequence of integers split by spaces.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), x is a list of n integers where each integer xi (2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7) is not necessarily distinct, m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), and each query is characterized by two integers li and ri such that (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9).
def func_2(li):
    if (not li) :
        return
        #The program does not return any specific value or variable since the return statement is incomplete.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `xi` (2 ≤ `xi` ≤ 10^7) is not necessarily distinct, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 50,000), and each query is characterized by two integers `li` and `ri` such that (2 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ 2·10^9). The value of `li` is a truthy value (not zero)
    for i in xrange(len(li) - 1):
        stdout.write('%d ' % li[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), `li` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `li` minus 1.
    stdout.write('%d\n' % li[-1])

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, the sequence of integers x contains n integers each in the range 2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50000, and each query is defined by a pair of integers li and ri where 2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_3():
    return stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a line of input read from standard input, which is a string with potential trailing newline removed


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
