The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `li`. `li` is part of a set of queries characterized by two integers, which suggests that it is likely involved in processing or responding to specific queries. However, since the output indicates that the program does not return any specific value or variable, it implies that the function performs an operation without providing a return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a parameter `li`, which is part of a query, and execute some operation without returning a specific output.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter li, which is part of a query, and performs an operation without returning a specific output.**
