The code prints the third element of the list `li` (at index `i`, which is 2). The values of `n`, `x`, and `m` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `li` has at least 3 elements, we can conclude that the third element exists and will be printed.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), `li` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and the third element of `li` will be printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), `li` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and the third element of `li` will be printed.**
