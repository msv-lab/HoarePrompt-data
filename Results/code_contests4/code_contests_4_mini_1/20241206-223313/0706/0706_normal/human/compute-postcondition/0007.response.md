According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `li`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(li) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `li` has at least 3 elements, `len(li)` is at least 3, which means `len(li) - 1` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), `li` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and the third element of `li` will be printed.**
