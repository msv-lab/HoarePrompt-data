The code outputs the second element of the list `li`, which is indexed by `i`. Given that `i` is 1, the output will be `li[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), `li` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, and the second element of `li` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50,000), `li` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, and the second element of `li` is printed.**
