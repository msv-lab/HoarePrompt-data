Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has several issues that lead to incorrect behavior. 

1. The input for `N` is read as a string and should be converted to an integer to determine the number of colors correctly.
2. The `raw_input.split()` method is incorrect because `raw_input` is not defined; it should be `input().split()`.
3. The logic to check for the number of colors is flawed. The program checks for the presence of 'Y' and immediately prints 'Four' if found. However, it incorrectly sets `N = -1` and prints 'Three', which is contradictory. It does not properly count distinct colors.
4. The program doesn't account for the situation where there are three colors (P, W, G) without 'Y', as it will print 'Four' whenever 'Y' is present, but never checks if all four colors are present or just three.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
P W G G
```
The expected output should be `Three`, but the program incorrectly does not handle this scenario and would not provide the correct output.
