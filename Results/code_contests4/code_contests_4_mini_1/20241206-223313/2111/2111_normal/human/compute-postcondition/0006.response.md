The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `S` at index `i` is 'Y'; 'Four' is printed, and `N` is assigned the value -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
