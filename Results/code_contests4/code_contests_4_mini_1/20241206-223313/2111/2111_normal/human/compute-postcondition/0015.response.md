The value of `N` is assigned the value -1. Since `N` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and the previous value of `i` is 1, the program does not affect the loop execution. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and 'Four' has already been printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is -1, `i` is 1, and 'Four' is printed without further loop execution.

Output State: **`N` is -1, `i` is 1, and 'Four' is printed without further loop execution.**
