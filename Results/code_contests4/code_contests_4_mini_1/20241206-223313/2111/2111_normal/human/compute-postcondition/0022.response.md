The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `N` and a list of strings `S`. The parameter `N` is an integer that must satisfy the condition 1 <= N <= 100. The parameter `S` is a list of strings, where each string can be one of the values 'P', 'W', 'G', or 'Y', and the list must contain at least one occurrence of 'P', one occurrence of 'W', and one occurrence of 'G'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on certain conditions derived from the contents of the list `S`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (1 <= N <= 100) and a list of strings S (containing at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G'), and returns a result based on the contents of the list.**
