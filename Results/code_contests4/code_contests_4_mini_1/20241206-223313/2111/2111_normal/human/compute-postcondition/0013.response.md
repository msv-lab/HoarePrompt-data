According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is -1, and `i` is 1. Since `N` is -1, the loop cannot execute again because `i` (1) is not less than `N` (-1). 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be at least 2 (to allow `i` to be less than `N`), and `i` would be 1, as it remains unchanged for this specific state.

State: **`N` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 1.**
