The function accepts an integer N (1 <= N <= 100) and a list of strings S (containing at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G'). It checks if there is at least one 'Y' in the list S. If 'Y' is present, it prints 'Four' and subsequently prints 'Three'. If 'Y' is not present, it does nothing further. The function does not return any values.
