Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that cause it to not meet the problem requirements:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The line `S = raw_input.split()` is incorrect. It should be `S = input().split()`, as `raw_input()` does not exist in Python 3 and will lead to an error.

2. **Logic Error in Color Count**: The algorithm attempts to check for the presence of 'Y' (yellow) to determine if there are four colors. However, if 'Y' is present, it immediately prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1, which then leads to the incorrect conclusion that we should print 'Three'. This logic is flawed because if 'Y' is present, it should only print 'Four' without any further checks.

3. **No Check for Three Colors**: The program does not correctly check for the case where only three colors (P, W, G) are present. It only checks for 'Y' to determine if it should print 'Four'. If 'Y' is absent, it incorrectly defaults to printing 'Three' due to the erroneous logic when `N` is set to -1.

4. **Improper use of N**: The variable `N` is being used inappropriately to control flow. After reading the input, it should only represent the count of colors, but the program changes its value to -1, which leads to confusion.

5. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases where all colors other than 'Y' are present. For example, if the input is `4` and `P W G P`, the program would not correctly determine the absence of 'Y'.

As a result of these issues, the program will fail under various input scenarios. For example, given the input:

```
4
P W G P
```

The expected output should be `Three`, but based on the flawed logic of the program, it does not handle this correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
