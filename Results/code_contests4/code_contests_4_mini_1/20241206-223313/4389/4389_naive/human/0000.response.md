To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to create exactly `m` steel chains connecting `n` fridges.
2. Each fridge must be private, meaning only its owner can open it.
3. The total cost of the chains should be minimized.
4. If it’s impossible to create the required number of chains while maintaining privacy, return -1.

### Code Analysis:
The code reads multiple test cases and processes each one with the function `func_1`. Here are the key parts of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads `n` and `m`, and then the list of weights `a`.
2. **Early Condition Check**: If `m < n` or `n == 2`, it immediately appends `-1` to the results. This is because:
   - If there are fewer chains than fridges (`m < n`), it’s impossible to ensure privacy.
   - If there are exactly 2 fridges (`n == 2`), one chain connecting them means both can open each other's fridges, violating privacy.
3. **Cost Calculation**: If the conditions are satisfied, it calculates the total cost as `2 * sum(a)` (since each fridge is connected to every other fridge twice).
4. **Chain Connections**: It generates connections in a circular manner (i.e., fridge 1 connects to fridge 2, fridge 2 connects to fridge 3, ..., fridge n connects back to fridge 1).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Case of `n = 2`**: As per the requirements, if there are 2 fridges, it's impossible to create a configuration that maintains privacy because any chain will allow the other person to open the fridge. The program correctly returns `-1` in this case.
2. **Condition `m < n`**: This condition is also correctly handled as it ensures enough chains are available.
3. **Cost Calculation and Chain Generation**: While the total cost calculation is straightforward, the way chains are generated (in a circular manner) does not guarantee that all fridges are private unless `m` is equal to `n`. If `m` is greater than `n`, the program simply duplicates the connections.

### Missing Logic:
- The program does not consider cases where `m` is between `n` and `2n - 2`. For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the program does not explicitly check if the two chains can guarantee privacy for all fridges. This may lead to a situation where privacy is compromised.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the specific requirements of privacy when `m` is between `n` and `2n - 2`. Thus, there could be scenarios where the chains cannot be set up in a way to ensure privacy even though the logic superficially seems to handle the basic constraints.

**Correctness: False**. 

**Example Case Where It Fails**: For `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the program would output a cost and chain connections, but since only 2 chains are there, both fridges can be opened by someone other than their owner, violating the privacy condition.
