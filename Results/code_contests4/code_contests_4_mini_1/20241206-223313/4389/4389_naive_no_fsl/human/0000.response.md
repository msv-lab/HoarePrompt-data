To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and compare it with the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
1. **Input Requirements:** 
   - There are multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, two integers `n` (number of fridges) and `m` (number of chains required) are provided.
   - An array of integers `a` representing the weights of the fridges follows.

2. **Conditions for Privacy of Fridges:**
   - A fridge is private if only its owner can open it. This means there should be sufficient chains such that no other person can unlock it alone.

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - If a solution exists, output the total cost and the pairs of fridges connected by chains.
   - If no solution exists, output `-1`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Early checks:**
   - The program checks if `m < n` or if `n == 2`. If either of these conditions is true, it appends `-1` to the result list `af`. 
   - This is a significant flaw because:
     - The program does not account for all potential cases where `n = 2`, and `m` could be `1`. As per the description, this should lead to non-privacy of the fridges.
     - It does not explore the situation where `m` could be equal to `n` or greater than `n`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The total cost is calculated as `2 * sum(a)`, which represents the cost of creating `n` chains connecting each fridge to its neighbor (this assumes a circular connection).
   - However, it does not handle the situation when `m` is less than `n`, meaning that the logic for creating chains does not ensure that all fridges are private when `m` is not equal to `n`.

3. **Chain Connections:**
   - The program outputs `n` connections in a circular manner (i.e., fridge 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., n to 1), which is a valid connection strategy but does not account for the need to create exactly `m` chains.

### Example to Highlight Incorrectness:
- For input `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the expected output should be `-1` because with only one chain, both fridges cannot be private. The program incorrectly handles this case by appending `-1`, which is correct.

- For `n = 2` and `m = 2`, the program will fail because it will try to create two chains which would allow both fridges to be opened by either person.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the requirement that the number of chains `m` must ensure the privacy of fridges. Since there are cases where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
