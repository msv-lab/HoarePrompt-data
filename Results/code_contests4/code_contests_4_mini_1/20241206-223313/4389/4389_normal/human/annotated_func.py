#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case includes two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n), followed by a list of n non-negative integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4) representing the weights of the fridges.
def func_1():
    n, m = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
    a = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
    if (m < n or n == 2) :
        af.append(-1)
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that there is no value to return from the function.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is assigned the first integer from the input, `m` is assigned the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` and `m`. `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `n` is not equal to 2.
    af.append(2 * sum(a))
    for k in range(n):
        af.append(str(k + 1) + ' ' + str((k + 1) % n + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, `m` is assigned the second integer from the input, `a` contains `n` and `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, and `af` contains `n` strings in the format "1 2", "2 3", ..., "{n} 1".
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is between 2 and 1000, and `m` is between 1 and `n`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers representing fridge weights. If `m` is less than `n` or `n` equals 2, the function appends -1 to a list `af` and returns None. Otherwise, it appends twice the sum of the weights to `af`, followed by `n` strings formatted as "k k+1", where `k` ranges from 1 to `n`, effectively creating a circular reference. Thus, the function processes the input and constructs a specific output based on the conditions provided.
