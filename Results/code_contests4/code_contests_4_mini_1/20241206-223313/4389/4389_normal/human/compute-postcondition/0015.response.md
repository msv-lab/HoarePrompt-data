Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is between 2 and 1000, and `m` is between 1 and `n`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers representing fridge weights. If `m` is less than `n` or `n` equals 2, the function appends -1 to a list `af` and returns None. Otherwise, it appends twice the sum of the weights to `af`, followed by `n` strings formatted as "k k+1", where `k` ranges from 1 to `n`, effectively creating a circular reference. Thus, the function processes the input and constructs a specific output based on the conditions provided. **
