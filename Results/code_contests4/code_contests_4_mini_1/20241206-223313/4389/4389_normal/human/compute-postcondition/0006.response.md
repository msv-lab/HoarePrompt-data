The code `af.append(2 * sum(a))` calculates the sum of the list `a`, which contains the values of `n` and `m`. Since `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum can be expressed as `n + m`. The result is then multiplied by 2 before being appended to the list `af`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the new value to the list `af`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the first integer from the input, `m` is assigned the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` and `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to 2, and `af` now contains a new element which is `2 * (n + m)` appended to it.**
