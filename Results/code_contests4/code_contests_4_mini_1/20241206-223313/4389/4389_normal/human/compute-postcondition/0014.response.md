The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is between 2 and 1000, and `m` is between 1 and `n`. Additionally, it accepts a list of `n` non-negative integers representing the weights of the fridges, with each weight being between 0 and 10,000. After executing the function body, the function returns None, indicating that there is no value to return from the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept multiple test cases with specified parameters related to fridge weights and return None. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases with parameters `n` (an integer between 2 and 1000), `m` (an integer between 1 and `n`), and a list of `n` non-negative integers representing fridge weights (each between 0 and 10,000), and returns None.**
