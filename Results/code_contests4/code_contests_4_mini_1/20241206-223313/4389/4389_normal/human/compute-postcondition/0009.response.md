According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. Since `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `n` is not equal to 2, `n` must be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is assigned the first integer from the input, `m` is assigned the second integer from the input, `a` contains `n` and `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 1, and `"1 2"` has been appended to `af`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
