The value of `div` is appended to the list `fac`. Since `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, and `x` is greater than 1, `div` holds the value of a specific element from `prim`. The state of `fac` will now include this new value of `div`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, `x` is greater than 1, and `fac` now includes the new value of `div`.

Output State: **`div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, `x` is greater than 1, and `fac` now includes the new value of `div`.**
