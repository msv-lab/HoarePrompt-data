According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. The loop condition is that `x` must be divisible by `div`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been adjusted to be `x //= div`, meaning `x` is now equal to its previous value divided by `div`. 

For the loop to execute again, `x` must be at least `div * div`. Therefore, we need to adjust the current state of `x` to ensure that it meets this requirement. Specifically, since `x` is now `x //= div`, we need to ensure that the previous value of `x` before the division was at least `div * div * div` (to ensure that after dividing by `div` we still have at least `div * div`).

Thus, the state needs to be modified to reflect that condition.

State: **`div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, and for the loop to execute again, x must have been at least `div * div * div` before the last division.**
