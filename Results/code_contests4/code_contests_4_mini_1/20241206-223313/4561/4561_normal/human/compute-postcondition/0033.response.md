The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a request in the form of a string ("+ i" or "- i") and an integer `i`, with `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, and `n` being a natural number such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`. After executing the function body, it returns a list of all prime factors of the original value of `x`, which is 1. Since 1 has no prime factors, the function returns an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of tuples and return an empty list representing the absence of prime factors for the number 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `x` and returns an empty list, as 1 has no prime factors.**
