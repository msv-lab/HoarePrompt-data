According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The condition `x > 1` implies that the length of the list `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. Right before the loop, `x` is a list of tuples containing requests. For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must contain more than one tuple.

Since `fac` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop condition; thus, it does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `x` contains more than one tuple. 

State: **`fac` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `x` must contain more than one tuple**
