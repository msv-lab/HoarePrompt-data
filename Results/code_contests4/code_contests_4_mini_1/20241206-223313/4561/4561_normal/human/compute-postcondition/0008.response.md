According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `div`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is divisible by `div`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been adjusted by dividing itself by `div`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be divisible by `div`, which means that `x` needs to be adjusted to be at least equal to `div` again. 

State: **`fac` contains one element which is `div`; x is adjusted by dividing itself by `div` and for the loop to execute again x must be adjusted to be at least equal to div**
