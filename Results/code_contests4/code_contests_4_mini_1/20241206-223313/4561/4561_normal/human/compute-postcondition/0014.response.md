To determine if the loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `x % div == 0`. This condition checks if `x` is divisible by `div`. If it is true, the loop will execute.

Given that `x` is the result of repeatedly dividing its initial value by `div` until `x` is no longer divisible by `div`, it implies that `x` has already been reduced to a value that is not divisible by `div` when we reach this state. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be divisible by `div`.

Thus, we can modify the state as follows:
- `x` must be adjusted to a value that is a multiple of `div` for the loop to execute.

State: **`x` is adjusted to be a multiple of `div`, `div` is assigned the value `prim[x]`, `fac` now includes the value of `div`**
