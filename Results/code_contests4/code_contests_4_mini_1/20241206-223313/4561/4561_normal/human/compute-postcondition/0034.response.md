Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x`, which is expected to be greater than 1 to perform prime factorization. It returns a list of all prime factors of `x`. However, if `x` is 1, the function will return an empty list because 1 has no prime factors. The function does not handle cases where `x` is less than or equal to 1 explicitly, and it assumes that `x` is a natural number greater than 1. **
