The code `fac.append(div)` appends the value of `div` to the list `fac`. Since `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, which is unknown, we cannot determine the exact content of `div`. However, we know that `fac` will now contain one element, which is the value of `div`.

The output state reflects the updated state of `fac` with one new element added, while `div` remains unknown.

Output State: **`fac` contains one element which is `div`, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]` which is unknown**
