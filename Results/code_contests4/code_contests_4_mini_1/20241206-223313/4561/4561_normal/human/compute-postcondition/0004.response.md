According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. The loop will execute if `x` is divisible by `div`, meaning that the condition `x % div == 0` must be true. Right before the loop, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, which is unknown. This means that we cannot determine the exact relationship between `x` and `div`.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `x` is such that `x % div == 0`. Since `div` is determined by the value of `prim[x]`, `prim[x]` must be a divisor of `x`.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, `x` must be a multiple of the value that `prim[x]` holds. 

State: **`fac` contains one element which is `div`, for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be a multiple of the value of `prim[x]`, where `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`**
