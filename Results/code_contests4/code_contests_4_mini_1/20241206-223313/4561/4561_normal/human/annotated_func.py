#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of colliders, and the function will handle m requests in the format of either "+ i" or "- i", where 1 <= i <= n.
def func_1(n):
    prim[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        if not prim[i]:
            for j in range(i, n, i):
                prim[j] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `prim` is an array where `prim[i]` represents the smallest prime factor of `i` for all integers `i` from 1 to `n-1` (with `prim[1]` being 1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and computes the smallest prime factor for each integer from 1 to `n-1`. However, the function does not process any requests in the format of "+ i" or "- i" as mentioned in the annotations, so that part is not implemented. Additionally, there's an assumption that `prim` has already been defined, but it is not initialized within the function, which could lead to an error if the function is called. Therefore, the function effectively initializes an array `prim` to store the smallest prime factors, but lacks necessary initializations and does not handle request processing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a request in the form of a string ("+ i" or "- i") and an integer i, with 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and n is a natural number such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000.
def func_2(x):
    fac = []
    while x > 1:
        div = prim[x]
        
        fac.append(div)
        
        while x % div == 0:
            x //= div
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is 1, `fac` contains all the prime factors of the original value of `x`, and `div` is the last prime factor used in the factorization process.
    return fac
    #The program returns the list of all prime factors of the original value of x, which is 1. Since 1 has no prime factors, 'fac' is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x`, which is expected to be greater than 1 to perform prime factorization. It returns a list of all prime factors of `x`. However, if `x` is 1, the function will return an empty list because 1 has no prime factors. The function does not handle cases where `x` is less than or equal to 1 explicitly, and it assumes that `x` is a natural number greater than 1.
