Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the required functionality to process the activation and deactivation requests for the colliders as described in the problem statement. 

1. **Missing Request Handling**: The `func_1` function initializes an array for the smallest prime factors but does not handle the activation ("+ i") or deactivation ("- i") requests. Without this logic, the program cannot respond to the user inputs as specified.

2. **Prime Factorization Function**: The `func_2` function, which computes the prime factors of a number, is not invoked anywhere in the code. Even if it were, it only returns prime factors for a single number and does not contribute to managing the state of activated colliders or checking for conflicts.

3. **Conflict Detection**: The problem description requires that when activating a collider, the program must check for conflicts with already activated colliders. Since there is no logic to track the activation state of colliders and check for relative primality, this requirement is not fulfilled.

4. **Output Format and Conditions**: The program lacks the implementation of the specific responses that must be returned based on the requests, including "Success", "Already on", "Conflict with j", "Already off", etc. There is no mechanism to track which colliders are currently active, which is essential for fulfilling the problemâ€™s requirements.

In summary, because the code fails to implement the core functionality described in the problem statement, it is not correct. It is missing essential logic to process requests and maintain the state of the colliders, which is necessary to determine the safety of their activation.
