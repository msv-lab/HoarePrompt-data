Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**: The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it lacks the main control structure that handles the activation and deactivation of colliders based on the requests. The problem description requires processing a sequence of requests and providing specific responses depending on the state of the colliders, which is not implemented in the given functions.

2. **Missing State Management**: There is no mechanism to keep track of which colliders are currently activated or deactivated. The problem specifies that colliders can be activated or deactivated, and it requires checking for conflicts based on whether activated colliders are relatively prime. The program lacks a way to store the activation states of the colliders.

3. **Prime Factorization Logic**: The function `func_2` is intended to compute the prime factors of a given number, but it is incomplete and does not serve a purpose within the context of the program as described. The logic to handle conflicts and determine if two colliders are relatively prime is not present. In the problem, the logic must check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is 1 to determine if they are relatively prime, but that logic is missing.

4. **No Output Generation**: The program does not generate any output based on the requests. The problem specifies that the program should print responses such as "Success", "Already on", "Conflict with j", etc., but the provided code does not contain any print statements or a structure to generate these outputs.

In summary, the provided program lacks the necessary components to fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description, such as managing the state of the colliders, handling the requests correctly, and producing the required output. Thus, the correctness of the program is False.
