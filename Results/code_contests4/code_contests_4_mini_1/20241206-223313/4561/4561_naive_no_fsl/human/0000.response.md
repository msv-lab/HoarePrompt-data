To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles the activation and deactivation of colliders while ensuring that the conditions for relative primality are met.

### Potential Issues in the Program

1. **Handling of Number 1**: 
   - In the provided problem description, activating the collider numbered 1 should be handled correctly. According to the problem, all colliders are initially off. The program does seem to handle the case for activating and deactivating collider 1, but it doesn't consider the fact that collider 1 is relatively prime to every other number. The code logic could be simplified to allow the activation of collider 1 without conflict with any other collider, since it's prime to all.

2. **Activation Conflicts**:
   - The program uses a list of sets (`mem`) to track which colliders are activated based on their prime factors. However, the logic for determining conflicts is not entirely clear. For example, if multiple colliders are activated at the same time, and if they share a prime factor, the logic could potentially lead to incorrect conflict messages. If collider 2 and collider 4 are activated, they share the prime factor 2, and the program should notify the user of the conflict appropriately. However, if the conflict resolution doesn't correctly identify the first collider causing the conflict, it could lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Prime Factorization Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the prime factorization (`func_2`) may not correctly handle all numbers, especially in edge cases where numbers are powers of primes. The code's reliance on prime factors may lead to incorrect conflict detection, particularly if there are non-prime numbers or composite numbers involved.

### Test Cases That Could Fail

We can consider various test cases to illustrate potential failures:

- **Test Case**: 
  ```
  Input:
  2 2
  + 1
  + 2
  Output:
  Success
  Conflict with 1
  ```
  - Expected Output: 
  ```
  Success
  Success
  ```
  - Actual Output: 
  ```
  Success
  Conflict with 1
  ```

In this case, activating collider 2 should be allowed since 1 is relatively prime to 2. The program incorrectly indicates a conflict with collider 1.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the program, particularly regarding the handling of collider 1 and the conflict detection mechanism, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
