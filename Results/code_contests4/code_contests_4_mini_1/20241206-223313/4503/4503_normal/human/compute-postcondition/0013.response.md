The value of `pos` is decremented by 1. Since `pos` is initially equal to `start - 1`, after executing `pos -= 1`, `pos` will be `start - 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start - 2`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is not equal to 0, `side` is a non-empty list, `step` is 0, `line` is a shallow copy of the first element in `side` if `add` is equal to `step`, `pos` is greater than 0, and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` is true.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start - 2`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is not equal to 0, `side` is a non-empty list, `step` is 0, `line` is a shallow copy of the first element in `side` if `add` is equal to `step`, `pos` is greater than 0, and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` is true.**
