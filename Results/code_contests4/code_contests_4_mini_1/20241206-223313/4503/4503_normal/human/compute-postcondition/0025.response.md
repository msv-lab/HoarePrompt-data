The value of `pos` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `pos` could be either `start - 2` or `start`. Thus, after the execution, `pos` will take on one of the following values: `start - 3` or `start - 1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `pos` is either `start - 3` or `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `side` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `step` is 1, and `line` is the second element in `side`.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is either `start - 3` or `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `side` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `step` is 1, and `line` is the second element in `side`**.
