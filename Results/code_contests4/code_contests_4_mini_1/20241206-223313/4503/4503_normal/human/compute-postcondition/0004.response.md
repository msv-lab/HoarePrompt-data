According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `side` variable. If `side` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, and `cross` is 0. The values of `step` and `line` will be initialized during the loop execution, starting with `step` at 0 and `line` being the first element of the `side`. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, `side` must contain at least one element. Thus, we need to ensure that `side` is a non-empty list. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `side` is a non-empty list, `step` is 0, and `line` is the first element in `side**.
