The value of `pos` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pos` can be either `start - 2` or `start`. Therefore, after execution, `pos` will be either `start - 1` or `start + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is either `start - 1` or `start + 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `side` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `step` is 1, and `line` is the second element in `side`.**
