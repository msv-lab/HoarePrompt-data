`cross` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables `start`, `pos`, and `add` remain unchanged, as this line only affects the variable `cross`. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, and `cross` is 0.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, and `cross` is 0**.
