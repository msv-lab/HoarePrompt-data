Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, if `pos` is greater than 0 and `line[pos - 1]` is true, then `add` is decreased by 1 and `cross` is updated based on `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, maintaining the state of `side` as a non-empty list with at least 2 elements and `line` as the second element in `side`. Otherwise, if `pos` is either `start - 1` or `start + 1`, `add` is decreased by 1 and `cross` is updated based on `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, while ensuring that if `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true, the state of the variables is maintained according to the stated conditions. If those conditions are not met, no specific action is taken.***
