Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is not equal to 0, `side` is a non-empty list, `step` is 0, and `line` is a shallow copy of the first element in `side` if `add` is equal to `step`. Additionally, `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true.***
