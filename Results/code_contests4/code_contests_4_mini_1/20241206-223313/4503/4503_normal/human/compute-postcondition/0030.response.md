The code `line = line[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `line`. The original `line` list remains unchanged, but `line` now refers to a new list that contains the same elements. Other variables such as `start`, `add`, `cross`, and `step` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is that `line` is a shallow copy of its previous state.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is updated based on `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `line` is a shallow copy of its previous state, `step` is incremented by 1.**
