`pos` is incremented by 1. Since `pos` is currently `start - 1`, after the execution, `pos` will be `start`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is not equal to 0, `side` is a non-empty list, `step` is 0, and `line` is a shallow copy of the first element in `side` if `add` is equal to `step`. 

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is `start`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is not equal to 0, `side` is a non-empty list, `step` is 0, and `line` is a shallow copy of the first element in `side` if `add` is equal to `step`**.
