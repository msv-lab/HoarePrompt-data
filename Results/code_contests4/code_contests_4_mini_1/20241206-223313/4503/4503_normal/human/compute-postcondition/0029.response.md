According to the code, the loop iterates over the `side` list, and the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `side`. At the end of the last iteration, the state has `side` as a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, and `line` is the second element in `side`.

Since `enumerate(side)` provides both the index (step) and the corresponding element (line) in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `step` must be increased by 1. Consequently, `line` would then be the next element in `side`.

Assuming the current `step` corresponds to the last element of `side`, `side` must have at least `step + 2` elements for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`start` is a positive integer, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is updated based on `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `side` must have at least `step + 2` elements, `line` is the next element in `side`, and `step` is incremented by 1.**
