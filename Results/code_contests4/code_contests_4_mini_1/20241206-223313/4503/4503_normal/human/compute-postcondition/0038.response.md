Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer. If `pos` is greater than 0 and `line[pos - 1]` is true, then `pos` is decreased by 1. If `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true, then `pos` is increased by 1. If `add` equals `step` and `cross` is false, the program returns two boolean values: False and False. Otherwise, the program does not return any values.***
