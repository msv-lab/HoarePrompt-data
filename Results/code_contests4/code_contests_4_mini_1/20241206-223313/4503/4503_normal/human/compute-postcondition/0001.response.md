The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1`. Since `start` is a positive integer representing the selected vertical line number (1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`), `pos` will be a zero-based index ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer; `pos` is `start - 1`.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer; `pos` is `start - 1`**
