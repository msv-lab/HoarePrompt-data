The value of `pos` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pos` is unknown, so we cannot specify its new value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is updated based on `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `line` is a shallow copy of its previous state, `step` is incremented by 1, and `pos` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is updated based on `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `line` is a shallow copy of its previous state, `step` is incremented by 1, `pos` is increased by 1**.
