Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is either `start - 2` if `pos` is greater than 0 and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` is true, or `start` if `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true. `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is not equal to 0, `side` is a non-empty list, `step` is 0, and `line` is a shallow copy of the first element in `side` if `add` is equal to `step`.***
