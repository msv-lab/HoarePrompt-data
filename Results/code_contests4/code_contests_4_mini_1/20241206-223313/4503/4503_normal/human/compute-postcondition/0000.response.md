Output State: **`start` is a positive integer representing the selected vertical line number (1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`); `side` is a positive integer representing the hit place (1 ≤ `side` ≤ `n`); `add` is a positive integer representing the number of stages (1 ≤ `add` ≤ 30); `left` is a list of strings of length `n-1`, where each string consists of `n-1` binary digits (0 or 1) representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of horizontal lines between vertical lines; `end` is the length of the first element in `side`, which is equal to `len(side[0])`.**
