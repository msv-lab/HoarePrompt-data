Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is either `start - 2` or `start`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `side` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `step` is 1, and `line` is the second element in `side`. If `add` equals `step`, and if `cross` is not true, the function returns a tuple (False, False); otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
