Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is updated based on `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `line` is a shallow copy of its previous state, `step` is incremented by 1. If `cross` is false, the program returns two boolean values: False and False. Otherwise, the program does not return any values.***
