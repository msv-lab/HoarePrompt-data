According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `side` list. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `side` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `step` is 0, so this corresponds to the first element of `side`. If `side` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute a second time. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `step` will be incremented to 1, and `line` will be the second element in `side`.

State: **`start` is a positive integer, `pos` is either `start - 2` if `pos` is greater than 0 and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` is true, or `start` if `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is not equal to 0, `side` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `step` is 1, and `line` is the second element in `side`.**
