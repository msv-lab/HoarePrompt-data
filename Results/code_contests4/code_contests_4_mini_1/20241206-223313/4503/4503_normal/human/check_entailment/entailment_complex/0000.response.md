Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the Amidakuji rules as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the annotations and logic in `func_1` and `func_2` indicate that certain conditions for adding a horizontal line are not properly handled. 

For example, `func_1` checks the conditions for hitting the target position, but it does not adequately handle scenarios where the horizontal line is required to be drawn at various positions leading to the hit. The conditions checking for the presence of horizontal lines seem to be overly restrictive, potentially leading to returning `False` when it should allow for a horizontal line to be drawn that could facilitate reaching the hit.

Moreover, the annotations suggest scenarios where it could return `False` even when a valid horizontal line could lead to the hit, failing to consider cases where adding a line might open up a path to reach the hit that wasn't initially possible.

Thus, since there are potential cases (e.g., when a horizontal line could be added but the logic fails to account for it) where the program does not meet the requirements as outlined in the problem description, the correctness is deemed **False**.
