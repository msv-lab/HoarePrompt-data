#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. It checks various conditions related to the Amidakuji game based on the values of these parameters. If any of the conditions regarding the vertical lines are not met, it returns `False`. If all conditions are satisfied, it marks the line at the position `pos` as hit and returns the position `pos` or `pos + 1`, depending on the context. The function ensures that the returned position is between 1 and the number of vertical lines `line`.

    return cross, pos + 1
    #The program returns the value of 'cross' and 'pos' incremented by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: a positive integer `start`, a list of strings `side`, a positive integer `add`, and a list of strings `left`. It processes these inputs to determine a position `pos` based on the presence of horizontal lines in `side`, and calls another function `func_1` at a specific step determined by `add`. The function returns a tuple containing the result of the `func_1` call (which can be a boolean) and the updated position `pos` incremented by 1. If the `func_1` call returns a falsy value, the function will return (False, False). The edge case of `add` being less than the number of iterations executed in the loop is handled by checking if `add` matches the current step. If no valid position is found, it also returns (False, False).
