line is an integer representing the number of vertical lines (1 < line ≤ 10), end is an integer representing the selected vertical line number (1 ≤ end ≤ line), pos is an integer representing the hit place (1 ≤ pos ≤ line), and left is an integer representing the number of stages (1 ≤ left ≤ 30). Following these, there are (line - 1) binary strings of length (line - 1) indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of horizontal lines between vertical lines.
