The function accepts four integer parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. It checks various conditions related to the Amidakuji game based on the values of these parameters. If any of the conditions regarding the vertical lines are not met, it returns `False`. If all conditions are satisfied, it marks the line at the position `pos` as hit and returns the position `pos` or `pos + 1`, depending on the context. The function ensures that the returned position is between 1 and the number of vertical lines `line`.
