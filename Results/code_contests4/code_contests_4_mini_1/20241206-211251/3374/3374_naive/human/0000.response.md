To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic of the robot processing the array as described.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. For each element `q` in the array:
   - If `q` is divisible by `x`, add `x` copies of `q/x` to the end of the array.
   - If `q` is not divisible by `x`, the robot shuts down and stops processing further elements.
2. The output should be the sum of all values in the array after processing.

### Program Analysis:
The core logic is found in the `func_1()` function:
- It reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `x`.
- It calculates how many times each element can be divided by `x` and stores this in `pow_x`.
- It identifies the minimum exponent in `pow_x` and uses this to determine how many times to multiply the sum of the original array.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Shutting Down Logic**: The robot should shut down as soon as it encounters an element that is not divisible by `x`. The program uses `pow_x` to determine the minimum power of `x` that divides the elements. This means it continues processing all elements, which may not reflect the robot's behavior.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation does not account for newly added elements after the robot processes an element. It only processes the original array and assumes all elements are added indefinitely based on the minimum power, which is incorrect.
3. **Missing Logic for New Elements**: The logic for adding new elements based on the division of current elements is not implemented. The program does not simulate the actual behavior of the robot, which adds new elements based on divisibility during processing.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 3
9 6 5
```
- For `9`: `9` is divisible by `3`. The array becomes `[9, 3, 3, 3]`.
- For `6`: `6` is divisible by `3`. The array becomes `[9, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]`.
- For `5`: `5` is not divisible by `3`, so the robot should shut down here.

The expected output is the sum of `[9, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2] = 22`. However, the program's logic does not correctly simulate this step-by-step addition and will not give the correct output.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly implement the described behavior of the robot and fails for specific cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
