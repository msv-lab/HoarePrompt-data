The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes two integers `n` (the size of a list) and `x`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates how many times each element in `a` can be divided by `x` and determines the minimum count of divisions across the list. It then calls `func_2` with a computed value based on the sum of the list multiplied by one more than this minimum count, plus the sum of the elements in `a` up to the index of the first occurrence of the minimum count. The function does not return any value; instead, it invokes another function (`func_2`) multiple times without handling or returning the result of those calls.
