`cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 2, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the result of the second element of the list `a` divided by `x`, `cnt` is 3, and `pow_x[i]` is 0.
