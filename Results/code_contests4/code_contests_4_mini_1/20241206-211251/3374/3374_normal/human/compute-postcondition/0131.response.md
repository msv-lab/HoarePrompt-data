The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 1, so after execution, `cnt` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2.
