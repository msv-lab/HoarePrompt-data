Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `pow_x` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` can be divided by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `x` is the input integer; `min_pow` is now the minimum value from `pow_x`.**
