According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai` and its relationship with `x`. The loop can execute again if `ai % x` equals 0. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is the floor division of the first element of `a` by `x` and it is currently such that `ai % x == 0`.

Since `ai` is currently such that `ai % x == 0`, it means that it is already suitable for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the current state.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ai` is the floor division of the first element of `a` by `x`.**
