The variable `ai` is assigned the value of `ai // x`, where `ai` is a multiple of `x`. Since `ai` is a multiple of `x`, the result of the integer division `ai // x` will be a positive integer. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, `cnt`, and `pow_x[i]` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ai` after the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is the result of `ai // x`, `cnt` is 1, `pow_x[i]` is `cnt`**
