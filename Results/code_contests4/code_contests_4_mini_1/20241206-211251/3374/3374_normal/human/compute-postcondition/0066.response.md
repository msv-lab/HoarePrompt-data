The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`, which resets its previous value (which was the count of how many times the second element of `a` can be divided by `x`). The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the second element of `a` after all divisibility checks by `x`, and `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`.
