The line of code `pow_x = [0] * n` initializes the list `pow_x` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The previous values of the affected variable `pow_x` are not specified, but it will be reassigned. The initial state of `n` is an input integer, which determines the length of the list. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers created from input, `pow_x` is a list of integers of length `n` initialized to 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**
