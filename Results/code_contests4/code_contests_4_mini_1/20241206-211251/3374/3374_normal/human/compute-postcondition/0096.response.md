The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input provided by the user, which are converted to integers through the `map` function. The previous values of `n` and `x` are not specified, so we cannot determine their initial values. Therefore, the output state will reflect that they are now set to the values resulting from the input.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer**
