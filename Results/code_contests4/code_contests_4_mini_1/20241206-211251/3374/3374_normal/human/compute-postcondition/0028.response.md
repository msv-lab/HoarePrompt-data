The variable `ai` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `a` divided by `x`, and `ai` is then updated by performing integer division with `x`. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, `cnt`, and `pow_x[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the result of the second element of the list `a` divided by `x`, `cnt` is 3, and `pow_x[i]` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the result of the second element of the list `a` divided by `x`, `cnt` is 3, and `pow_x[i]` is 0.**
