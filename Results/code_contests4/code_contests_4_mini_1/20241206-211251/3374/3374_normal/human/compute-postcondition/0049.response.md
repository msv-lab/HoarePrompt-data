The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input provided, using the `map` function to convert the input values to integers. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `pow_x`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`) remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `n` and `x` based on user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers with at least `t` elements, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`; `n` and `x` are input integers.**
