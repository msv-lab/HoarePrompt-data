Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is the last value from `args`, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `at_start` is False; all values from `args` have been written to the file using `file.write(str(x))` for each iteration of the loop.**
