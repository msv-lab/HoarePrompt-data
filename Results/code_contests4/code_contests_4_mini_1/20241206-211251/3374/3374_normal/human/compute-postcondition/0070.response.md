According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai` and the integer `x`. The loop can execute again if `ai` is divisible by `x` (i.e., `ai % x == 0`). 

At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is the result of the operation `ai // x`. Since `ai` underwent integer division by `x`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must be adjusted such that it remains divisible by `x`. 

Given that `ai` is assigned as `ai // x`, if `ai` was originally `x` or a multiple of `x`, it would now be `ai // x`, which could potentially be less than `x`, depending on its initial value. 

To ensure that `ai` can still satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`, we need to ensure that `ai` is adjusted back to a value that is still divisible by `x` after the division. This means `ai` must be a multiple of `x` greater than or equal to `x` again, as the next value after division would need to still be a multiple of `x`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x * 2` (to ensure that after division by `x` it can still be divisible by `x`).

State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x * 2`**
