Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least `t` elements, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`; `func_2` is called with the argument `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`.**
