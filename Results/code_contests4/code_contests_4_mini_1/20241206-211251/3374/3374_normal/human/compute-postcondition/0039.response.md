To determine the conditions under which the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` loop condition `ai % x == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `ai` must still be divisible by `x`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ai` has been divided by `x`, so its current value is `ai / x`.
- We know that `ai` was initially divisible by `x`, and now it needs to remain divisible by `x` after the division.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ai / x` must still be divisible by `x`. This implies that `ai` must be at least `x^2` (since dividing by `x` once gives us `ai / x`, and we need to ensure that is still divisible by `x`).

Thus, we need to ensure that the initial value of `ai` was at least `x^2` to allow for another iteration after being divided by `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `ai` must be at least `x^2`.**
