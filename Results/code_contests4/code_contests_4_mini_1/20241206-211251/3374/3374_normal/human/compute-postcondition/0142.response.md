Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pow_x` is a list of integers where each element `pow_x[i]` is the count of how many times the `i`-th element of `a` is divisible by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`; and `func_2` has been called multiple times with the argument `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])` for each iteration of the loop.**
