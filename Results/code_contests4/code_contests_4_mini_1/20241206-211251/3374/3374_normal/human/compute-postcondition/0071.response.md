The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 1, so after execution, `cnt` will be 2. The states of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, and the condition for the loop) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x * 2.**
