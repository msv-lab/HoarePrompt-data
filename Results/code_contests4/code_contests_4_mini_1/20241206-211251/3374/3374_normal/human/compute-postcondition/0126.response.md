The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment directly sets `cnt` to `0`, but does not affect any other variables. The previous value of `cnt` was not given, but it is now explicitly changed to `0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is `cnt`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, and `ai` is the value of the third element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is `cnt`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the value of the third element of `a`**.
