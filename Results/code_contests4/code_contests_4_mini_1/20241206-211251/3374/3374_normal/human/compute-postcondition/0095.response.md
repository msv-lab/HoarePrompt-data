According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than the current iteration count, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we don't have a specific iteration count given, but since the loop is controlled by `range(t)`, we can infer that the loop has executed `t` times until now. 

Assuming the loop has executed its last iteration, the next iteration will be the `t`-th iteration, which means the loop index will be `_` equal to `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the current iteration count. Therefore, the next state will reflect that it has executed `t` times, and `_` will be updated to `t`.

State: **The result of the calculation is `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`, for the loop to execute a `t`-th time `t` must be greater than `t`.**
