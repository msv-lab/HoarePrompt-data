The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, and `ai`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 2, and `ai` is the floor division of the first element of `a` by `x`.
