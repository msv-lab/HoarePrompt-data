The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is reset to zero. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, and `pow_x[i]`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt` has been reset to 0 while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `pow_x[i]` has been assigned the value of `cnt`.**
