The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 1 to 2. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements (third element now `a[2]` is adjusted to be a multiple of `x`), `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2.
