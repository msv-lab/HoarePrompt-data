The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 1, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned a list of integers with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `a0` must be divisible by `x`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned a list of integers with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `a0` must be divisible by `x`.**
