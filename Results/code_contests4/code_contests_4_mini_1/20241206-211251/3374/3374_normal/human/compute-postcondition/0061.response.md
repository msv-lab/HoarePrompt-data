The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 2, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 3. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 3, and for the loop to execute again, `ai` must be adjusted to be a multiple of `x`.
