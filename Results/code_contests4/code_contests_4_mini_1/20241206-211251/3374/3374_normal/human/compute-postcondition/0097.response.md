The line of code assigns `a` a list of integers obtained from user input, which is split into separate strings and then converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are not directly affected, but `a` will now hold the list of integers inputted by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned a list of integers from input.**
