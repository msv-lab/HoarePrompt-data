The code `ai //= x` means that the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` will be divided by `x` using integer division and assigned back to that same element. The variables `t`, `_`, and `cnt` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `i` is 2, this operation will apply to the third element in the list `a` (assuming 0-based indexing).

The output state will reflect that `a[i]` has been modified, but we need to acknowledge that the specific values of `a`, `x`, and the result of the division are not provided in the initial state. Since `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, we cannot determine the exact value of `ai` before the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `a[i]` is modified by integer division with `x`.**
