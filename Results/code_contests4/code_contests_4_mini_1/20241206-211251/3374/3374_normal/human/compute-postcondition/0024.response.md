The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a`. 

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a` for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` is an integer that is a threshold value (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9).
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs based on the given constraints. 

The output behavior is not explicitly detailed in the provided prompt; hence, we can infer the functionality based on the input parameters without detailing the internal logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, x, and a, where t is the number of test cases, n is the number of integers in the list a, x is a threshold integer, and a is a list of integers.**
