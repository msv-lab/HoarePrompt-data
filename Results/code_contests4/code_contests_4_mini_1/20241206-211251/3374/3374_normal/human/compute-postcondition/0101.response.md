According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ai` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `ai` is divisible by `x`. Right before the loop, `ai` is assigned the first element of the list `a`, which has at least one element, and `x` is an input integer. 

To ensure the loop executes for the first time, we need `ai` to be divisible by `x`. If `ai` is not divisible by `x`, the loop will not execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the first element of the list `a` (which is `ai`) needs to be a multiple of `x`. If `ai` is not already a multiple of `x`, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned a list of integers with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element of the list `a` (which needs to be a multiple of `x`), `cnt` is 0**
