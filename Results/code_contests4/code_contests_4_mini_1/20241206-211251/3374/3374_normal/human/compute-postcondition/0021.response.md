Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is the last value from `args`, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `at_start` is False; the file has written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, and the flush keyword argument was set to True.***
