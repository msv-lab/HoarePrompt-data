The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is a multiple of `x`, `cnt` is 1, `pow_x[i]` is `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is a multiple of `x`, `cnt` is 1, `pow_x[i]` is `cnt`**
