The statement `ai //= x` indicates that the element at index `i` of the list `a` (which is `a[i]`) will be updated by performing integer division of its current value by `x`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x` or the elements in the list `a`, we can only describe the change in terms of the variables.

The value of `a[i]` will be updated to `a[i] // x`. Since `i` is 2, this means we are modifying the third element of the list `a`. The other variables `t`, `_`, and `cnt` remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements (and the third element is now `a[2] // x`), `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements (third element now `a[2] // x`), `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1**
