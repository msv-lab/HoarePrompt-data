The operation `ai //= x` performs an integer division of the value at the index `i` of the list `a` by `x`, and then assigns the result back to that same position in the list. The list `a` has at least 3 elements, and since `i` is 2, it refers to the third element `a[2]`.

Given that `a[2]` is a multiple of `x`, the result of the operation will be that `a[2]` is updated to a value that is `a[2] // x`. 

Other variables such as `t`, `_`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unaffected by this operation.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `a[2]` while maintaining the original conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] // x`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3**
