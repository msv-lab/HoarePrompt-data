The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 2, so after execution, `cnt` will be 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned a list of integers with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 3; for the loop to execute again, `ai` must be at least `x` after being processed.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned a list of integers with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 3; for the loop to execute again, `ai` must be at least `x` after being processed.**
