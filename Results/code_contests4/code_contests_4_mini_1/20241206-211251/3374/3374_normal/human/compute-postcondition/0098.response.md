The code initializes `pow_x` as a list containing `n` elements, all set to 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `pow_x` and its characteristics. 

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input integer, `x` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned a list of integers from input, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros**.
