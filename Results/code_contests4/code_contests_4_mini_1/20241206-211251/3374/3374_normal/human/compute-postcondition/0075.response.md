The value of `ai` is being modified by performing an integer division by `x`. Since `ai` is an element from the list `a`, its new value will be the result of `ai // x`. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged, and we don't know the specific values of `ai` or `x`. Therefore, we note that `ai` is adjusted to meet the condition for divisibility by `x`, but we cannot specify the new value of `ai` without knowing `x`.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 3, and `ai` is adjusted by performing integer division with `x`.**
