Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is the last value from `args`, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `at_start` is False; if the flush keyword argument was set to True, then `file.flush()` has been called, ensuring that any buffered output to the file is written out to the file immediately.***
