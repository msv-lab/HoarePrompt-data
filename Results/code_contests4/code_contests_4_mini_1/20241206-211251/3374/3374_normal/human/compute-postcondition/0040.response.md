The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is not specified, but it is stated that `cnt` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
