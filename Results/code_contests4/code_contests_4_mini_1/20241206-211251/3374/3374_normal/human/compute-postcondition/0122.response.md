The value of `ai` is divided by `x` using floor division. Since `ai` must be equal to or greater than `x` for the loop to execute again, the value of `ai` is affected by this operation. The specific previous value of `ai` is not given, but we know that after executing `ai //= x`, the new value of `ai` will be `ai // x`, which will be less than `ai` if `ai` is greater than or equal to `x`. 

The output state reflects the change in `ai`, but since the previous value is not specified, we will only mention that `ai` has changed.

Output State: **`ai` is now `ai // x`**
