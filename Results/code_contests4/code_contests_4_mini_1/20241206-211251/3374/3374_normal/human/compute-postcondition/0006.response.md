Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a positive integer (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and `at_start` is False. If `at_start` is False, a value has been written to the file using `file.write(sep)`.***
