Given that `ai` refers to an element of the list `a` at index `i`, we will use `i` which is 2 to access `a[2]`.

The operation `ai //= x` performs an integer division of `ai` by `x` and then assigns the result back to `ai`. 

Since the specific values of `n`, `x`, and `a[2]` are not provided in the initial state, we can denote:
- Let `a[2]` be the value of the third element in the list `a`.
- The new value of `a[2]` will be `a[2] // x`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a[2]` has been modified based on the division, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2; `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] // x`.**
