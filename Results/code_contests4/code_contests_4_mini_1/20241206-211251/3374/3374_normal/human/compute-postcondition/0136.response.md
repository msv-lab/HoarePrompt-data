Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is `cnt`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is the number of times `a[2]` was divisible by `x`, and `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] // x^cnt` (where `x^cnt` is x raised to the power of `cnt`).**
