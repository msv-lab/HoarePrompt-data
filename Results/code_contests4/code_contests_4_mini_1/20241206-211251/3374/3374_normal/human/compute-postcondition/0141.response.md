To derive the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the effects of the code on the given initial state.

1. The function `func_2` is called with an argument.
2. The argument is calculated as follows:
   - `sum(a)` calculates the total sum of the list `a`.
   - `min_pow + 1` adds 1 to the minimum value from the list `pow_x`.
   - `sum(a[:min_idx])` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` from the start up to (but not including) the element at index `min_idx`.

3. The overall expression combines these calculations:
   - The product of `sum(a)` and `(min_pow + 1)` gives a certain value.
   - This value is then added to `sum(a[:min_idx])`.

4. The values of `sum(a)`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `sum(a[:min_idx])` are derived based on their previous states but are not explicitly stated in the output since they are not independent variables affecting the final output.

Based on this analysis, the output state can be stated as it reflects that a value is returned from the function `func_2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list where each element `pow_x[i]` is the count of how many times the `i`-th element of `a` is divisible by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, and a value has been returned from `func_2`.**
