The variable `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The previous value of `cnt` is used directly, but no information about the specific value of `cnt` or the other variables is provided, so we cannot determine their values. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment without specific values.

Output State: **`pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`**
