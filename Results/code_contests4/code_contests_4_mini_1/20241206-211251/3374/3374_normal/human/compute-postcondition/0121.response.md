The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 2, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 3. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `pow_x` is a list where `pow_x[0]` is `0`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be equal to or greater than `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `pow_x` is a list where `pow_x[0]` is `0`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be equal to or greater than `x`.**
