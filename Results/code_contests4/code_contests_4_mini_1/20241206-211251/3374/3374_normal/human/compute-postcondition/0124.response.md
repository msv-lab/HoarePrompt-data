The variable `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. Since `pow_x[0]` is `0`, the index `i` is `1`, and we do not have the current value of `cnt`, we can only conclude that `pow_x[1]` will now hold whatever value `cnt` has. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is `cnt`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is the number of times the second element of `a` was divisible by `x`, and `ai` is the value of the second element of `a` divided by `x` raised to the power of `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is `cnt`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is the number of times the second element of `a` was divisible by `x`, and `ai` is the value of the second element of `a` divided by `x` raised to the power of `cnt`.**
