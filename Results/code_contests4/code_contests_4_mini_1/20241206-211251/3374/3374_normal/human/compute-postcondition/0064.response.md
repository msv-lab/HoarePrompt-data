The variable `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` represents how many times the first element of `a` can be divided by `x` before it is no longer divisible. The variable `i` is used as an index to store this count in the `pow_x` list. Since the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `ai` are not directly affected by this assignment, we will maintain their existing states.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `cnt` is the count of how many times the first element of `a` can be divided by `x`, `ai` is the final value of the first element of `a` after all divisibility checks by `x`, and `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`.**
