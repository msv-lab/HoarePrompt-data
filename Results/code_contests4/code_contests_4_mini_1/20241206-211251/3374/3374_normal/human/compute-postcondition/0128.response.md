The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` is initially 0, after execution, `cnt` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is `cnt`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `pow_x[0]` is 0, `pow_x[1]` is `cnt`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1**
