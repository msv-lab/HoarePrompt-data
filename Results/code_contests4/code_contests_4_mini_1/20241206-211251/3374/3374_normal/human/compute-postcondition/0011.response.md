Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is the next value from `args`, `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and `at_start` is False; if `at_start` is False, a value `x` has been written to the file using `file.write(str(x))`, and `sep` has been written to the file.***
