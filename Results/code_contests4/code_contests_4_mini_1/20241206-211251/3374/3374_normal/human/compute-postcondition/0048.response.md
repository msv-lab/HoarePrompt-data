According to the code, the loop will execute again if the value of `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, which means the loop has executed for the first time. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will increase by 1. Therefore, `_` will become 1, and for the loop to be executed a second time, the condition requires that `_` is still less than `t` (which it is, since `t` is between 1 and 100).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers with at least `t` elements, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`; the loop to execute a second time if `_` is less than `t`.**
