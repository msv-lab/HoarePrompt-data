`cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 2 to 3. The other variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, and the condition concerning `a[2]` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements (third element `a[2]` is a multiple of `x`), `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements (third element `a[2]` is a multiple of `x`), `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3**
