The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a` are not directly affected by the code snippet provided. The code is simply extracting the `sep` and `file` parameters from `kwargs`, which are optional keyword arguments. Since `kwargs` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the values of `sep` and `file` after this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and `a` is a list of integers where each integer a_i is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `sep` and `file` are not defined.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and `a` is a list of integers where each integer a_i is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `sep` and `file` are not defined.**
