The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `a` is a list of integers where each integer a_i is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `a` is a list of integers where each integer a_i is within the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `at_start` is True.**
