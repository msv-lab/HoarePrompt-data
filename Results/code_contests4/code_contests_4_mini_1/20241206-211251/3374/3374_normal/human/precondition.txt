t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and x is an integer (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The array a contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 10^5.
