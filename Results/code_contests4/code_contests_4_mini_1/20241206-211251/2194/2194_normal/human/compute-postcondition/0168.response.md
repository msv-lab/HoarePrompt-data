Postcondition: ***If `t[i]` is equal to '7', then the loop is exited, ensuring that `n` is at least 2, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' minus 2 (if '5' is found) or -3 (if not found), and `ans` represents the number of elements shifted (which is `n - 1 - (i - 2)` if '5' is found or 0 if not).***
