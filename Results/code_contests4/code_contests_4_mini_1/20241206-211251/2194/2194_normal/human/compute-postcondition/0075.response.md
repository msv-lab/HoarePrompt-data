The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The variable `j` is `n - 1`, so `j + 1` is `n`. Therefore, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `t[n]` exists, but its specific value is not known. Other variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`.**
