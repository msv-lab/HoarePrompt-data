To analyze the provided code snippet, we observe the following:

1. The variable `ans` is augmented by the calculation `n - 2 - i`.
2. The variable `i` is defined as `n - 1`, which means we can substitute `i` in the expression.
3. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `ans += n - 2 - (n - 1)`.
4. Simplifying further: 
   - `ans += n - 2 - n + 1`
   - `ans += -1`.

Thus, `ans` decreases by 1.

All other variables (`n`, `i`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged after this operation. 

Given that `n` is between 1 and 19, and `i` is `n - 1`, the specific values of `n` and `i` do not change, and `cnt` remains equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is equal to 1, `ans` is decreased by 1.**
