The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop in which we were currently executing. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' - 2 (if '5' is found) or -3 (if not found), `ans` is the number of elements shifted (n - 1 - (i - 2) if '5' is found or 0 if not), and we break out of the loop.
