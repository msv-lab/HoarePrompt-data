The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Given that `j` is `n - 1`, this means that `t[n]` will be assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`, and `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`, and `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]**
