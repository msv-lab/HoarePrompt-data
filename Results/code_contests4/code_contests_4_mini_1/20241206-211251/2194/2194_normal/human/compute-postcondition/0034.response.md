Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 19 and `i` is `n - 2`. If `cnt` equals 0, `ans` is increased by 1 and `cnt` is also increased by 1. If `cnt` equals 1, `ans` remains unchanged and `cnt` is increased by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt` is neither 0 nor 1, the program continues as per the surrounding logic without executing the if part.***
