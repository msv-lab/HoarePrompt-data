The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and then `t[j]` (which is `t[1]` since `j` is 1) is assigned the value of `temp`. This means that `t[1]` now holds the value that was previously in `t[2]`. The state of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and the other elements of `t` (except for `t[1]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, `j` is 1, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and `t[1]` is now equal to `t[2]`.
