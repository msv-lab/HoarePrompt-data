The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The previous value of `j` is `i + 2`, so `temp` will hold the value of `t[i + 3]`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `j`, and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 4, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' and incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`, and `temp` is equal to `t[i + 3]`.
