Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `ans` is the previous value plus 1, and `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by the previous value of `ans`. If `t[i]` is not '0', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
