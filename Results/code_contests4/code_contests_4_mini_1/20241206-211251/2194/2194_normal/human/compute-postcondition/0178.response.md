In the given code, `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Here, `j` is calculated as `i + 1`, which translates to `j + 1` being `i + 2`. The variable `t[j]` holds some value based on the array `t`. By assigning `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`, the value at index `i + 2` in the array `t` is updated to the value at index `i + 1`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `j`, and `temp`) remain unchanged, as this operation only affects the array `t`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' (now increased by 1), `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` where `j + 1` is `i + 2`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' (now increased by 1), `j` is `i + 1`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` where `j + 1` is `i + 2`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.**
