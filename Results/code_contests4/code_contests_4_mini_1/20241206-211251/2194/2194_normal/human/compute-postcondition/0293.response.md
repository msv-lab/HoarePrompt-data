Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, with no leading zeroes; `s` is a string representation of `n`. If `n` is divisible by 25, the output is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in `s`, `five` is the count of '5' characters in `s`, `two` is the count of '2' characters in `s`, and `seven` is the count of '7' characters in `s`. If `fin` is greater than 10^10, -1 is printed; otherwise, if `fin` is greater than or equal to 10, `ans` is set to 1000000000000000, `t` is modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions with the first element of `t` being '0', and `fin` is printed.***
