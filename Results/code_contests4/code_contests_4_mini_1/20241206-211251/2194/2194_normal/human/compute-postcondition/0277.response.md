Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed plus 1, and `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions; the first element of `t` is '0'. If `t[i]` is not '0', then we break out of the most internal loop.***
