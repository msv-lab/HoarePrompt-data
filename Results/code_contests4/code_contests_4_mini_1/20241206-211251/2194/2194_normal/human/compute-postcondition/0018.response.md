`cnt` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 1`, the `i`-th element of the list `t` is '0', `cnt` is 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
