The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations executed (which is `n - 1 - i`), `t` is the list after elements from index `i` to `n - 1` have been shifted left by `n - 1 - i` positions, and the element at index `i` of `t` is '2', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
