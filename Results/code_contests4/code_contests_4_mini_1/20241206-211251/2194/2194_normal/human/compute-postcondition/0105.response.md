To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the provided initial state and the behavior of the loop.

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is either -1 or in the range [0, n - 1).
   - `ans` is either 0 (if `n` is 0 or 1) or `n - 1` (if `n` is at least 2 and no '2' found).
   - `t` is unchanged.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute from `j = i` to `j = n - 2`.
   - For each iteration, `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - The values in the list `t` get swapped, specifically `t[j]` and `t[j + 1]`.

3. **Determining Loop Execution**:
   - If `i` is -1, the loop will not execute at all.
   - If `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), the loop will execute `(n - 2) - i + 1` times, which is `n - 1 - i` times.

4. **Output State After Loop Execution**:
   - If `i` is -1, the loop does not execute, so `ans` remains the same as its initial value.
   - If `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), the final value of `ans` will be `ans + (n - 1 - i)`, and `t` will have undergone a series of swaps.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - If `n` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0, and `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is at least 2 and `i` is at least 0, then `ans` will equal its initial value plus the number of iterations executed, which is `ans` incremented by `n - 1 - i`, and the list `t` will reflect the final state after all swaps.

Considering these points, we can summarize the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is updated based on the number of iterations, `t` is modified according to the swaps performed in the loop.**
