According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, and `n` is greater than 1. Since `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n - 1`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, `j` is 1**
