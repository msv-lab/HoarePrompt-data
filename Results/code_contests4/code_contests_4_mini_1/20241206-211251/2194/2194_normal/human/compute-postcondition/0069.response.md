The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is not specified. The states of other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 2**
