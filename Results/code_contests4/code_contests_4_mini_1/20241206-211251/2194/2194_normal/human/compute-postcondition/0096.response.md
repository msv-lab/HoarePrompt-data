The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but it will now be one greater than it was before. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `t` is updated with `t[j]` now being equal to `t[j + 1]`, `t[j + 1]` retains its previous value, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `t` is updated with `t[j]` now being equal to `t[j + 1]`, `t[j + 1]` retains its previous value, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
