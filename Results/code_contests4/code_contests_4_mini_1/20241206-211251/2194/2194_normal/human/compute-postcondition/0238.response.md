Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`; `ans` is the number of processed elements (equal to the number of iterations of the loop); `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n-1` have been shifted left by the value of `ans` positions.**
