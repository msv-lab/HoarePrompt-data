According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which means it is about to execute for `i = n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be decremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming `n - 3`. 

Since `n` is at least 2, `i` will be valid (i.e., non-negative) in the next iteration if `n - 3` is greater than or equal to 0. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is n - 3, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations executed (which is `n - 1 - (n - 3) = 2`), and `t` is the list after elements from index `i` to `n - 1` have been shifted left by `n - 1 - (n - 3) = 2` positions.**
