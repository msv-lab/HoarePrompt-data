The value of `ans` is increased by 1 due to `ans += 1`. The initial conditions indicate that `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' and is now increased by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' (now increased by 1), `j` is `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' (now increased by 1), `j` is `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `i + 3.**
