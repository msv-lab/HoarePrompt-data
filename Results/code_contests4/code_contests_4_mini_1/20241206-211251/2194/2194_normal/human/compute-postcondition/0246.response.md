According to the code, the loop will execute again based on the value of `i`. The loop's starting point is `n - 2`, and it decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `n - 4`. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` can take on the value of `n - 4`, and the loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches -1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 4`, and `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be at least `n - 2`**
