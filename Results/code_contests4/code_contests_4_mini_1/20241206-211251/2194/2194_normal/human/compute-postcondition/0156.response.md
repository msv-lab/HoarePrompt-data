The code assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. The variable `j` is previously calculated as `i + 2`, so `t[j + 1]` refers to `t[i + 3]`. The value of `t[i + 3]` is now set to the value of `t[i + 2]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19); `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is increased by 1; `j` is `i + 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.**
