The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and then `t[j + 1]` is updated to the value of `t[j]`. Finally, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, which means that `t[j]` is now equal to the original value of `t[j + 1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged, while the values in the list `t` are shifted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `t` is updated with `t[j]` now being equal to `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `t` is updated with `t[j]` now being equal to `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` retains its previous value.**
