`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is increased by 1, but the exact value of `ans` is not provided. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `i + 1`**
