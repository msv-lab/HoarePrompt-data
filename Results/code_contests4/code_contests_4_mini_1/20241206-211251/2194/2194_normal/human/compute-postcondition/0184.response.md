The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[i + 3]`, which is equal to `t[i + 2]`. The assignment `t[j] = temp` means that `t[j]` will now hold the value of `t[i + 2]` as well. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 4`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' and incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 2]`, `t[i + 3]` is equal to `t[i + 2]`, and `temp` is equal to `t[i + 3]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 4`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' and incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, `t[j]` is now equal to `t[i + 2]`, `t[i + 3]` is equal to `t[i + 2]`, and `temp` is equal to `t[i + 3]`.**
