According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `n`, and the range specified in the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, and since `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `j` will be at least 1 and at most `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n - 1`. 

Given that `j` is currently `i + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must become `i + 1 + 1`, which is `i + 2`. This means that `i + 2` must also be less than `n - 1`, implying that `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

Therefore, after adjusting for the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 2`. 

State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.**
