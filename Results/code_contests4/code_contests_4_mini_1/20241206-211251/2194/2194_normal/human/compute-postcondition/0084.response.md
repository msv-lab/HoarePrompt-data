The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is 2, and `t` is the list after elements from index `i` to `n - 1` have been shifted left by 2 positions, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
