The variable `ans` is incremented by 1 with the operation `ans += 1`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment in `ans` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4 (and not equal to 3), `i` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the number of iterations + 1, `t` is modified according to the swaps performed in the loop, the first element of `t` is '0'.**
