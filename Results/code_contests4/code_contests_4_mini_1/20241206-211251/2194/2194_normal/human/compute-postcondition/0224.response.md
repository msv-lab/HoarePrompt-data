The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the previous state does not specify the value of `ans`, we only note that it has been increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
