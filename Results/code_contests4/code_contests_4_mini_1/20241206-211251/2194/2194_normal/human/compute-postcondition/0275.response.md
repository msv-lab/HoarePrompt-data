According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 4. This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n - 3`. 

Since `n` is at least 4, `n - 3` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` must be less than 1 for the loop to execute again, which is true after the increment.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed plus 1, `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions; the first element of `t` is '0'**
