The code `ans += n - 1 - i` modifies the variable `ans`. The value of `i` is `n - 2`, so we can substitute this into the equation:

- `ans += n - 1 - (n - 2)`
- Simplifying gives: `ans += n - 1 - n + 2`
- Which further simplifies to: `ans += 1`

Thus, the variable `ans` is increased by 1. The variable `n` remains between 1 and 19, and since the condition for the loop to execute a second time is satisfied (as `n` must be greater than 1), we can conclude that the state of `i` also remains `n - 2`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1**
