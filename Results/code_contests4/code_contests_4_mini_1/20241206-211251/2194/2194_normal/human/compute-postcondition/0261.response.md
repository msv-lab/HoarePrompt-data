The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` has been increased by 1, but the specific previous value is unknown. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `temp`, `j`, `t`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `i` is either -1 or the index of the first '5'; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`; `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute a second time; `t[j]` is now equal to the value of `t[j + 1]` and `j` is less than `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is either -1 or the index of the first '5'; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`; `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute a second time; `t[j]` is now equal to the value of `t[j + 1]` and `j` is less than `n - 2.**
