The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a valid string representation of an integer with at least 1 digit, and the character at index `i` in `t` is '5', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
