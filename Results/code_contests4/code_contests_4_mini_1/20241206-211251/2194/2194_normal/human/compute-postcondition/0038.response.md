The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 19; `i` is `n - 3`; `ans` is increased by 2; `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19; `i` is `n - 3`; `ans` is increased by 2; `cnt` is increased by 1.**
