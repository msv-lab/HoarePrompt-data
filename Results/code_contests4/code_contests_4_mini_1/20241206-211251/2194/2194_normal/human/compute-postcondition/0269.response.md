Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and not equal to 3; `i` is either -1 or the index of the first '5'; `ans` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed; `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions; the first element of `t` is '0'.***
