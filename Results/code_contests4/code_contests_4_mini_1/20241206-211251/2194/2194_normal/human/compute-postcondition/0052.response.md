According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because the range specified is from `n - 1` to `-1`, which means that if `n` is 0, the loop will not run at all. Additionally, at the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to `n - 1`, which is the last index of the character list `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a valid string representation of an integer with at least 1 digit**
