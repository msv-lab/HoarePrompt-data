The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was initially equal to 1, after this operation, `cnt` will be 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is decreased by 1**
