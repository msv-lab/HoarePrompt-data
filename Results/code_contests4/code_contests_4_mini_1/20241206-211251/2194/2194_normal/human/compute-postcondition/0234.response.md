The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `ans` is not provided, we cannot specify its exact new value, but we know it has increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, `j` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, `j` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
