Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1. If `n` is equal to 3, then `i` is either -1 or the index of the first '5', `ans` is 1000000000000000, and `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions with the first element of `t` being '0'. If `n` is greater than 1 and not equal to 3, then `i` is the index of the first non-zero element encountered or `n - 3` if all elements are '0', `ans` is the count of consecutive '0's found, and `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions with the first element of `t` being '0'.***
