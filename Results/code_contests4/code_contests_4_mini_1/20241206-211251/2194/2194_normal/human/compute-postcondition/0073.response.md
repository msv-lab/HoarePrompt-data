According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will iterate while `j` is in the range from `i` to `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), and `j` is `n - 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n - 1`, which means `j` should be incremented. Since `j` is currently `n - 2`, the next value of `j` will be `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be equal to `n - 1`, which is outside the current range, indicating that the loop cannot run again.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value `t[n - 1]`, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, which is `t[n - 1]`**
