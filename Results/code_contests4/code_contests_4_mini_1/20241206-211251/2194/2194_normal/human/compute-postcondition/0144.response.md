The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), and `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, but we do not have the previous value of `ans`. Therefore, the output state refers to the incrementing of `ans` without specifying its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
