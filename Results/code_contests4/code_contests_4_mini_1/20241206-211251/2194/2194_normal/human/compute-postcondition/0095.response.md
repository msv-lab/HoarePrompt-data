According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `i`, and since `n` is at least 2, `n - 2` is at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Currently, `j` is at least `i`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than `n - 2`. Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`. 

To summarize:
- `j` will be updated to `j + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again in the next iteration, `j` must be less than `n - 2`, which means `j + 1` must also be less than `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `t` is updated with `t[j]` now being equal to `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` retains its previous value, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n - 2` and `j` will be incremented by 1.**
