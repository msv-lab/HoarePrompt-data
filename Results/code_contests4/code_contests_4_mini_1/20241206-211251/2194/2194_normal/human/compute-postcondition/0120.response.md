The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4 (and not equal to 3), `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to the number of iterations + 1, `t` is modified according to the swaps performed in the loop, the first element of `t` is '0', and `ans` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
