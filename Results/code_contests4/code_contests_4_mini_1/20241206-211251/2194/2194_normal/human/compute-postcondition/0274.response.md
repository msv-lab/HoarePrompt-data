The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `ans` represents the number of iterations the loop executed, after this execution, the new value of `ans` will be one more than its previous value. Other variables, specifically `n`, `i`, and `t`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed plus 1, and `t` has been modified as stated.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed plus 1, `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions; the first element of `t` is '0'.**
