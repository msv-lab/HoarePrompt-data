The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
