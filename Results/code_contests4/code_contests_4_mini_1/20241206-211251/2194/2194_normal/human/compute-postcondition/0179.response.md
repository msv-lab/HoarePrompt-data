The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, which is equal to `t[j]`. When the line `t[j] = temp` is executed, the value of `t[j]` is updated to be the same as that of `t[j + 1]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `ans` is adjusted based on the occurrence of '5' (now increased by 1), `j` is `i + 1`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`.
