Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 19, and `i` is `n - 1`. If the `i`-th element of the list `t` is '0', then if `cnt` is 0, `cnt` is set to 1 and `ans` remains unchanged. If `cnt` equals 1, `ans` is decreased by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt` is not equal to 1, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
