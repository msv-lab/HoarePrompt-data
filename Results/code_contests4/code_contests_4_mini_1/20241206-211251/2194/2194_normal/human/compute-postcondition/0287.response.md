Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `s` is a string representation of `n`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in `s', `five` is the count of '5' characters in `s', `two` is the count of '2' characters in `s', and `seven` is the count of '7' characters in `s'. If `zero` is at least 1 and `five` is at least 1, then `n` is greater than 1; `i` is either -1 or the index of the first '5'; `ans` is set to 1000000000000000; `t` is modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions with the first element of `t` being '0'; and `fin` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `ans`. Otherwise, `fin` remains unchanged.***
