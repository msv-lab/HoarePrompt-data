The code `ans += n - 1 - i` updates the value of the variable `ans`. The previous state indicates that `i` is `n - 1`. Therefore, the expression `n - 1 - i` simplifies to `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, which equals `0`. The variable `ans` is incremented by `0`, meaning its value remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 1`, the `i`-th element of the list `t` is '0', `cnt` is equal to 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
