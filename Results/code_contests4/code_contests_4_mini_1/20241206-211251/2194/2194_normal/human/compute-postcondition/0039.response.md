The value of `ans` is incremented by `n - 2 - i`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, we can substitute `i` to get the expression as follows: `n - 2 - (n - 3)`, which simplifies to `1`. Therefore, `ans` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and since `n` is between 1 and 19, and `i` is `n - 3`, it is guaranteed that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is incremented by 1**
