The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed plus 1, the new value of `ans` will be the previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and `t`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is the previous value plus 1, and `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by the previous value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is the previous value plus 1, and `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by the previous value of `ans`.**
