The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is at least 0 and less than 16, `n` is at least 4 and between 1 and 19 and not equal to 3, `ans` is `n - 1 - i`, `t` has elements from index `i` to `n - 2` shifted to the right, the first element of `t` is '0', and the element `t[i]` is not '0'; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
