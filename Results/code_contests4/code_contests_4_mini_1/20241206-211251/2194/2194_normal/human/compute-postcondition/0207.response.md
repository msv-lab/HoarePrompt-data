Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `s` is a string representation of `n`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in `s', `five` is the count of '5' characters in `s', `two` is the count of '2' characters in `s', `seven` is the count of '7' characters in `s', and `fin` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `ans`. If `seven` is at least 1 and `five` is at least 1, then `fin` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `ans`. Otherwise, `fin` remains unchanged.***
