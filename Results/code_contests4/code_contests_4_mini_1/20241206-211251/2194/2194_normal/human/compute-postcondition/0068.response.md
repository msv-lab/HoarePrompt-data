According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was initialized to `i` (which is somewhere between `0` and `n - 1`), and it is increased by 1 after each iteration. Since `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n - 1`. 

If `j` was equal to `n - 2` at the end of the last iteration (the maximum value it can take before the loop terminates), then for the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented to `n - 1`. This means that `i` must be at least `n - 1` (but it cannot be, as it is in the range `[0, n - 1)`). Thus, if `j` was `n - 2`, it will increment to `n - 1`, and the loop will terminate.

So for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be set to `n - 2` and `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1; `j` is `n - 2` for the loop to execute one more time.**
