The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`. Then, `t[j]` (where `j` is `n - 1`) is assigned the value of `temp`, effectively updating `t[n - 1]` to the value that was in `t[n]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `t[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `t[n]`.**
