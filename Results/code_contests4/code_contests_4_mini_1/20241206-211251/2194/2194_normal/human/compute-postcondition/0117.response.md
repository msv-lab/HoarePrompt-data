Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4 (and not equal to 3), `i` is 1, `ans` is updated based on the number of iterations + 1, `t` is modified according to the swaps performed in the loop, the first element of `t` is '0', and if `t[i]` is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
