The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Given that `j` is 0, this means `t[1]` will now hold the value of `t[0]`. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, `j` is 0; `ans` is now increased by 1; `temp` takes the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[1]` is now equal to `t[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, `j` is 0; `ans` is now increased by 1; `temp` takes the value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[1]` is now equal to `t[0]`**.
