The code assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. Here, `j` is 1, so `j + 1` is 2. Therefore, `t[2]` will receive the value that is currently held in `t[1]`. Since `temp` was previously assigned the value of `t[2]`, this assignment does not affect `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, `j` is 1, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and `t[2]` is now equal to `t[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`, `j` is 1, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and `t[2]` is now equal to `t[1]**
