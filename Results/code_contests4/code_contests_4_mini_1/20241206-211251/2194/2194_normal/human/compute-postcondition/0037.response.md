`ans` is incremented by the value of `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is `n - 3`, we can substitute this into the equation to get:

```
ans += n - 1 - (n - 3)
```

This simplifies to:

```
ans += n - 1 - n + 3
ans += 2
```

Thus, `ans` is increased by 2. The value of `n` is between 1 and 19, and since `i` is `n - 3`, `i` will be at least 0 when `n` is 3. Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute a second time (i.e., `n >= 3`) are satisfied.

The output state reflects that `ans` has been increased by 2, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 19; `i` is `n - 3`; `ans` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19; `i` is `n - 3`; `ans` is increased by 2**
