The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed plus 1, `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions; the first element of `t` is '0' and we break out of the most internal loop.
