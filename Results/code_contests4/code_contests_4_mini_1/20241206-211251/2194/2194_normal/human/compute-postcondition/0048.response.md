Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `s` is a string representation of `n`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in `s`, `five` is the count of '5' characters in `s', `two` is the count of '2' characters in `s`, `seven` is the count of '7' characters in `s', and `fin` is 10^18. The count of '2' characters in `s` is at least 1, the count of '5' characters in `s` is at least 1. If `zero` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is calculated as the total increment based on the indices of the two '0's found in `s`, `cnt` is set to 2, and `fin` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `ans`; otherwise, `fin` remains unchanged.***
