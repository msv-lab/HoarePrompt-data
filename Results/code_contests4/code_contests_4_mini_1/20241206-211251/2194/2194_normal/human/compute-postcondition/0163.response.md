According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and its relation to `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' or -1 if '5' is not found. 

If `i` is -1, the loop will not execute again. However, if `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. The loop decrements `i` by 1 with each iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be decremented from its current value to `i - 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be set to its current value minus 1, and `n` will remain the same. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of '5' - 1 (if '5' is found) or -2 (if not found), `ans` is the number of elements shifted (n - 1 - (i - 1) if '5' is found or 0 if not)**
