The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The variable `j` must be defined and must satisfy the condition that `j + 1` is a valid index within the bounds of `t`, meaning `j` can range from 0 to `n - 2` since `n` is the length of `t`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.
Output State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]**.
