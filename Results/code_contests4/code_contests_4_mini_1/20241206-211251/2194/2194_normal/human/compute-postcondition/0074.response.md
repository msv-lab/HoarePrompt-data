The variable `ans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but it is known that it was increased. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `temp`, and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value `t[n - 1]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, which is `t[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is assigned the value `t[n - 1]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, which is `t[n - 1]**
