Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is equal to 3, then `ans` is 1000000000000000, and the first element of `t` is '0'. If `n` is at least 4 (and not equal to 3), then `ans` is `n - 3`, `t` is modified according to the swaps performed in the loop, and the first element of `t` is still '0'.***
