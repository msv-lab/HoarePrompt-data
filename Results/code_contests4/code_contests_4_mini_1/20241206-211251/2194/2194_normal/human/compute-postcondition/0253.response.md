The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. This means that the element at index `j + 1` in the list `t` is now equal to the element at index `j`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `i` is either -1 or the index of the first '5'; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is either -1 or the index of the first '5'; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.**
