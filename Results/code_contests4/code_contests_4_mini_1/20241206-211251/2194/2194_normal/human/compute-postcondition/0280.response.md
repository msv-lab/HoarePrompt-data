The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `ans` is the previous value plus 1, and `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by the previous value of `ans`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
