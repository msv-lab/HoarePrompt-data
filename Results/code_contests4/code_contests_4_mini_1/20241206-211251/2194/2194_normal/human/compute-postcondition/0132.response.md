According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`, which is the length of `t`. Given that `n` is between 1 and 19, the loop will execute at least once since `n` is at least 1. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, meaning `i` will start at `n - 1` and decrement to `0`. Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to ensure `i` is initialized to `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time**
