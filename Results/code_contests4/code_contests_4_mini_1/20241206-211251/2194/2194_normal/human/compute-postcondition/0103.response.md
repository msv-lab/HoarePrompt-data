The code assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. This means that `t[j + 1]` will now hold the value previously stored in `t[j]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, `temp`, and `t[j]` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the state of the affected variable `t[j + 1]` is updated to match `t[j]`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `t[j + 1]` is now equal to the previous value of `t[j]`, `t[j]` retains its previous value, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`.**
