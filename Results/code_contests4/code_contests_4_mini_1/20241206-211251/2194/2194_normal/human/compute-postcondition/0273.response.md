Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `t` has been modified such that elements from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted right by `ans` positions; the first element of `t` is '0'. If the element at index `i` of `t` is not '0', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
