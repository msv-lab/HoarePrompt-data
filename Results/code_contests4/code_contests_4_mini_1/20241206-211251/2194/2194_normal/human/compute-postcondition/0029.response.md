The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, and `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, `cnt` is increased by 1**
