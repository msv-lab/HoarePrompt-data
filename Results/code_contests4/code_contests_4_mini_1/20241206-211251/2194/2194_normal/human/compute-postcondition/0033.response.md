Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 2`, if `cnt` equals 1, then `ans` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is increased by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt` is not equal to 1, the program does not execute the if part and continues as per the surrounding loop or logic.***
