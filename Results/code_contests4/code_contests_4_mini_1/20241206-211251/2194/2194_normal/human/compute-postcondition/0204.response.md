Postcondition: ***`i` is at least 0 or -1, `n` is between 1 and 19. If `n` is equal to 3, then `ans` is 1000000000000000, and `t` has the elements from index `i` to 1 shifted to the right if `i` is at least 0, or `t` is unchanged if `i` is -1, with the first element of `t` being '0'. Otherwise, if `n` is between 1 and 19 but not equal to 3, `ans` is the count of '0's in `t` from index 0 to `n - 2`, and `t` remains unchanged.***
