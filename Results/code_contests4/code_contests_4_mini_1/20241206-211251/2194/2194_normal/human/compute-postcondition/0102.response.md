The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The previous values indicate that `t[j + 1]` retains its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `t[j + 1]` retains its previous value, `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be equal to `n - 2; `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 0, `t[j + 1]` retains its previous value, `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`**
