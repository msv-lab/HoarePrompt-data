`cnt` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `cnt` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine its specific value after execution. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this operation. The output state reflects the change in `cnt` and acknowledges the existing values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is incremented by 1; `cnt` is increased by 1**
