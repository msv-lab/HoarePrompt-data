The code assigns the value of `t[j + 1]` to the variable `temp`. The value of `j` is previously defined as `i + 2`, and since `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `j` will be at least 2 and less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `j + 1` will be at least 3 and less than `n + 2`.

Since the length of `t` is between 1 and 19, `t[j + 1]` is valid as long as `j + 1` is within the bounds of the string `t`. The assignment does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19); `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is increased by 1; `j` is `i + 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.**
