Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 19, `i` is `n - 1`, and the `i`-th element of the list `t` is '0'. If `cnt` is 0, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `ans` remains unchanged. If `cnt` is equal to 1, then `ans` is decreased by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt` is not equal to 1, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
