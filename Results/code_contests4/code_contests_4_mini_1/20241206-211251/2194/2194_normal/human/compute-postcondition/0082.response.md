Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations executed (which is `n - 1 - i`), and `t` is the list after elements from index `i` to `n - 1` have been shifted left by `n - 1 - i` positions. If the element at index `i` of `t` is '2', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
