The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is in the range [0, n - 1), `ans` is increased by 1**
