Postcondition: ***If `t[0]` is '0', then `i` is at least 0 or -1, `n` is between 1 and 19. If `n` equals 3, `ans` is set to 1000000000000000, and if `i` is at least 0, `t` has the elements from index `i` to 1 shifted to the right; if `i` is -1, `t` remains unchanged. If `n` is between 1 and 19 but not equal to 3, then `ans` is the count of '0's in `t` from index 0 to `n - 2`, and `t` remains unchanged. If `t[0]` is not '0', the conditions remain unaltered as no else part exists.***
