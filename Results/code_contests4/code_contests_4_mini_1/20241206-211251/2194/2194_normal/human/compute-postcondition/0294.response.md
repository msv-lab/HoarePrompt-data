The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate with an integer `n` which is specified to be between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, and must not have leading zeroes. The output behavior of the function has not been provided, so we cannot determine the return value based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined in terms of its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is expected to work with an integer n between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, with no leading zeroes, but the return value is not specified.**
