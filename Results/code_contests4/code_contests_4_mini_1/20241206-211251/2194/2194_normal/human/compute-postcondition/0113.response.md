Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4 (and not equal to 3), `i` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the number of iterations, `t` is modified according to the swaps performed in the loop, the first element of `t` is '0'. If the element at index `i` of `t` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `t[i]` unchanged.***
