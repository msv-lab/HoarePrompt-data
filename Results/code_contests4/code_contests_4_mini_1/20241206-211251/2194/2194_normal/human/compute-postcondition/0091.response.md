`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but it is adjusted to reflect this increment. The states of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is adjusted to at least 0, `t` is unchanged; `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is adjusted to at least 0, `t` is unchanged; `ans` is increased by 1.**
