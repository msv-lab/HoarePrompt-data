The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `s` is a valid string representation of an integer with at least 1 digit, and the character at index `i` in `t` is not '5', and we break out of the most internal loop.
