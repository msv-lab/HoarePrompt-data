The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `j` is equal to `i + 1`, this means that the value at the index `j + 1` in the list `t` will now hold the value that was at index `j`. Given that `n` is the length of `t` and `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is valid and the operation will successfully copy the value from `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `i + 1`, `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`.**
