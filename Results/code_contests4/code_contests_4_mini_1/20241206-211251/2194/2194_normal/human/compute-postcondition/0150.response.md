The variable `j` is assigned the value `i + 1`, meaning `j` is at least 1 and less than `n`, since `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`. The code then attempts to access `t[j + 1]`, which means it accesses the element at index `j + 1`. 

Given that `j` is at least 1, `j + 1` is at least 2. Since `n` is the length of `t` and is between 1 and 19, `j + 1` must be less than `n` for this operation to be valid. Therefore, the value of `temp` is assigned `t[j + 1]`, which is a valid access given the constraints.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `i + 1`, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `t` (between 1 and 19), `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `j` is `i + 1`, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.**
