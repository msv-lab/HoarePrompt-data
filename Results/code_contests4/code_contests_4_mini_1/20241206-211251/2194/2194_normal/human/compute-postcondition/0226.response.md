The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`, which means that the element at index `j + 1` in the list `t` takes the value of the element at index `j`. This operation modifies the list `t` but does not affect the other variables directly. The states of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is -1 or the index of the first '0' from the end of `s`; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`**.
