The function accepts no parameters. It reads an integer `n` (in string format) between 1 and 10^18 from input. If `n` is divisible by 25, the function prints 0. If not, it checks for the presence of the digits '0', '5', '2', and '7' in `n` to determine the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the digits such that `n` ends with "00", "50", "20", or "70". If no valid arrangement can be made, or if the minimum moves exceed 10^10, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of moves. The function does not handle invalid input scenarios or leading zeroes, which may arise from user input.
