Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Handling of Divisibility by 25**: The program checks if the input number `n` is divisible by 25 and prints `0` if true. This is correct according to the problem description. However, the subsequent logic for finding the minimum number of swaps does not cover all necessary cases for forming a number that ends in either "00", "50", "20", or "70".

2. **Logic Errors in Calculating Moves**: The program attempts to calculate the number of moves required to rearrange the digits to form a valid ending for divisibility by 25. However, it only checks for pairs of '0's, '5's, '2's, and '7's in a limited manner. Specifically:
   - The algorithm does not appropriately manage the scenario where a '0' must be moved to the last position when forming "50" or "00".
   - The transitions to form "20" and "70" are not fully developed, leading to potentially missing valid configurations that can be achieved with fewer moves.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program has a condition where it sets an arbitrary large number (`10**15`) in case it encounters a specific pattern. This does not align with the problem's requirement to only return the minimum number of moves or -1 if impossible. The logic for counting moves, especially when dealing with leading zeros or invalid configurations, seems overly complex and does not ensure correctness.

4. **Infinite Loop Risk**: The code uses `xrange`, which is not standard in Python 3 (it should use `range`). This indicates that the code may not run correctly in a Python 3 context, leading to potential runtime errors.

5. **Failure to Handle All Configurations**: The program doesn't account for all possible configurations that would allow for the formation of a number divisible by 25. For example, if a number has no valid pairs or sufficient digits to form the required endings, it fails to exit gracefully with an appropriate response.

In summary, while the program begins with the right idea, it fails to implement the logic correctly and comprehensively for all cases stipulated in the problem description, particularly with regard to the requirements for divisibility by 25 using swaps of adjacent digits.
