To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. You can swap adjacent digits of an integer `n` without leading zeros.
2. The goal is to find the minimum number of moves to make `n` divisible by 25.
3. If it's impossible to make `n` divisible by 25, the program should return -1.

### Key Requirements:
- A number is divisible by 25 if it ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.
- The program must ensure that any transformation does not lead to a number with leading zeros.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initial Check**: The program starts by checking if the input number `n` is already divisible by 25. If it is, it prints `0`, which is correct.
  
2. **Counting Digits**: 
   - It counts the occurrences of `0`, `2`, `5`, and `7` in the number, which are essential for forming valid endings (00, 25, 50, 75).

3. **Formation of Valid Endings**:
   - The program checks for valid pairs of digits to form the acceptable endings:
     - For `00`: It checks if there are at least two `0`s.
     - For `25`: It checks if there is at least one `5` and one `2`.
     - For `50`: It checks if there is at least one `0` and one `5`.
     - For `75`: It checks if there is at least one `5` and one `7`.

4. **Calculating Moves**: 
   - The program calculates the number of adjacent swaps needed to bring the required digits to the end of the number.

5. **Output**: If the minimum moves calculated exceed a certain threshold, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to form a valid number.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not consider the case when there are not enough digits to form the required ending pairs. For example, if the number is `500`, it has a `5` and two `0`s, but it only considers pairs without checking the feasibility of moving them without leading zeros.
- Additionally, the logic does not handle cases where the digits necessary for forming a valid ending can be blocked by leading digits. For instance, in the number `102`, there are `0` and `2` available but they cannot be rearranged to form `25`, leading to an incorrect result.

### Example of Failure Case:
For the input `102`, the program would incorrectly compute the moves since it does not account for the leading digit `1` blocking the formation of `25`. The expected output should be `-1`, but the logic may miscalculate and provide a number of moves instead.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program can fail to identify situations where it's impossible to form a valid number (like in the case of `102`), the correctness of the program cannot be assured.

Correctness: **False**
