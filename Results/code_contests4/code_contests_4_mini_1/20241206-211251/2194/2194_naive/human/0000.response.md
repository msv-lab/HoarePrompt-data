To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze if the code meets all the requirements and handles all potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer input `n`, which is converted into a string format. This allows for manipulation of digits.

2. **Immediate Check for Divisibility by 25**: 
   - If `n` is already divisible by 25, it immediately returns `0`, which is correct.

3. **Counting Digits**:
   - It counts the occurrences of digits '0', '5', '2', and '7'. This is important to determine if a valid number can be formed that ends in '00', '25', '50', or '75' (the only combinations that are divisible by 25).

4. **Logic for Each Combination**:
   - The program checks for the presence of pairs of digits that can be rearranged to form valid endings for divisibility by 25.
   - It then calculates the number of adjacent swaps required to move the necessary digits into place.

5. **Handling Leading Zeroes**: 
   - It checks if forming the desired number would lead to a leading zero and adjusts the result accordingly.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case where no valid pair exists**: If the input has no '0', '5', '2', or '7', the program should return `-1` indicating that it's impossible to create a number divisible by 25. The logic seems to handle this through the final checks on `fin`, but it is essential to ensure all combinations are considered.
  
- **Case with only one valid digit**: When the number only has a single '5' or '0' without a matching pair, the program must ensure it recognizes this as impossible if no valid ending can be formed.
  
- **Testing against edge inputs**: Consider a case like `100`, which should return `1` since moving the '0' next to '0' makes it divisible by 25. The program should handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:
The implementation follows the logic outlined by the problem statement, checking for valid endings and counting swaps. However, there's a critical point about handling all possible combinations of digits that lead to a valid number divisible by 25.

The most significant edge case that might not be fully handled is the situation where only one of the digits ('0', '5', '2', '7') is present, which might lead to incorrect results. For example, if we input `555` or `222`, the program may not correctly recognize that it's impossible to form a valid ending.

### Test Case:
- Input: `100` should return `1`, which is correct.
- Input: `55` or `22` should return `-1`, which might not be handled properly.

Given this reasoning and potential failure points, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
