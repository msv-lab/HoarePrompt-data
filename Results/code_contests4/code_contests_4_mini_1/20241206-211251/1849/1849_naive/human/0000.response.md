To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The string consists of characters '(', ')' and '#'.
2. Each '#' must be replaced with one or more ')' characters.
3. The final string must be "beautiful", meaning:
   - At no point in the string (from the start to any index) should the count of ')' exceed the count of '('.
   - The total counts of '(' and ')' must be equal.

### Program Analysis:
```python
rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
s = rstr()
(left, right, sh) = (s.count('('), s.count(')'), s.count('#'))
(ans, p) = ([1] * (sh - 1) + [abs(right - sh - 1)], 0)
for (j, i) in enumerate(s):
    if i == '(':
        left -= 1
    elif i == ')':
        right -= 1
    else:
        right -= ans[p]
        p += 1
    if right > left:
        print(-1)
        exit()
print(*ans, sep='\n')
```

### Key Points from the Code:
1. The code counts the number of '(', ')', and '#'.
2. It initializes a list `ans` where the first `sh - 1` elements are set to 1 (indicating each of the '#' can be replaced with at least one ')').
3. The last element of `ans` is set to `abs(right - sh - 1)`, which is intended to adjust the last '#' to balance the number of ')' and '('.
4. During iteration over the string:
   - It decrements counts for '(' and ')' as they are encountered.
   - For each '#', it decrements the right parentheses count according to the current answer.
   - If at any point the count of ')' (right) exceeds the count of '(' (left), it outputs -1.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program does not guarantee that the number of ')' will always be adjustable to match the required counts after replacements. The final adjustment using `abs(right - sh - 1)` could lead to invalid scenarios where the resulting string could still end up with an excess of ')' at some point.
2. The last element of `ans` being calculated as `abs(right - sh - 1)` may lead to negative values or inappropriate counts, which could make it impossible to maintain a valid "beautiful" string.
3. The check `if right > left:` is critical but doesn't account for conditions where even with valid replacements, the balance could be off due to previous placements of '(' and ')'.

### Example Cases Where It May Fail:
- For input `#`:
  - The program outputs `-1` correctly as there's no valid replacement.
- For input `(#)`:
  - The program outputs `-1`, but it should output `-1` as well since there's no valid replacement possible.
- For a case like `((#)`, the expected output could be `1` but the check for balancing might fail if the logic in `ans` isn't correct leading to potential invalid outputs.

### Conclusion:
The logic built into the program does not comprehensively handle the requirements for all edge cases, particularly around balancing '(' and ')' correctly, and could lead to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails in scenarios where the adjustments made by `abs(right - sh - 1)` do not lead to valid counts of ')' replacing '#' while maintaining the beauty of the string.
