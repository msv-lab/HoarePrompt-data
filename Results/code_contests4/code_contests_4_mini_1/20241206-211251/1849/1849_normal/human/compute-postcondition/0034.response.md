Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', if `i` is equal to ')', then `right` is decreased by 1, while `sh` remains unchanged, and `j` is less than the length of `s`, with `i` corresponding to the next element in `s`. Otherwise, `right` is decreased by `ans[p]`, `sh` remains unchanged, `j` is less than the length of `s`, `i` is the next element in `s`, and `p` is increased by 1.***
