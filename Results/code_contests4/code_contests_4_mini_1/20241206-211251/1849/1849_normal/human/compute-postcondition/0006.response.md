The value of `left` is decremented by 1, which reduces the count of '(' by 1. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is decremented by 1, `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list of size `sh` with `sh - 1` ones followed by `abs(right - sh - 1)`, `p` is 0, `s` is a non-empty sequence, `j` is 0, and `i` is equal to '('.
