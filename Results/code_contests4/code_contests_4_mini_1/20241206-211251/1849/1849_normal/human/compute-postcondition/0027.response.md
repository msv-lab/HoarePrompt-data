The execution of the `exit()` function will terminate the program. The values of the variables `left`, `right`, and `sh` will not change, but the program will stop running at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#'; -1 is printed and the program terminates.

Output State: **`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#'; -1 is printed and the program terminates.**
