The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown, but it will now be one less than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`right`, `sh`, `j`, `i`, and the conditions regarding `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is decremented by 1, `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#', `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is the next element in `s`.

Output State: **`left` is decremented by 1, `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#', `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is the next element in `s`.**
