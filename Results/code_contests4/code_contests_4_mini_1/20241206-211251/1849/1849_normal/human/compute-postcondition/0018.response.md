Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', and `sh` is the count of '#'. If `right` is greater than `left`, the program is terminated with `ans` being a list of size `sh` consisting of `sh - 1` ones followed by `abs(right - sh - 1)`, and `p` is 0. If `right` is not greater than `left`, no changes are made to the state.***
