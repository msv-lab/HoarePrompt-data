Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', and `sh` is the count of '#'. If `i` is equal to '(', then `left` is decremented by 1, `ans` is a list of size `sh` with `sh - 1` ones followed by `abs(right - sh - 1)`, and `p` is 0. If `i` is equal to ')', then `right` is decremented by 1, and the state of `ans` remains the same. If `i` is neither '(' nor ')', then `right` is decremented by `ans[p]`, `p` is updated to 1, and the state of `sh` and `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, `s` is a non-empty sequence, and `j` is 0 in all cases.***
