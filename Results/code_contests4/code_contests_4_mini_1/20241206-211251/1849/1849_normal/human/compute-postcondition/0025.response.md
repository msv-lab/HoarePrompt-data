Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', and `sh` is the count of '#'. If `i` is equal to '(', `left` is decremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is the next element in `s`. If `i` is equal to ')', then `right` is decremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is the next element in `s`. Otherwise, `right` is decreased by `ans[p]`, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in `s`, and `p` is incremented by 1.***
