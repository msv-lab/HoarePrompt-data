The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the execution is halted. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list of size `sh` with `sh - 1` ones followed by `abs(right - sh - 1)`, `p` is 0 when `i` is '(', and `j` is 0, and the program is terminated.
