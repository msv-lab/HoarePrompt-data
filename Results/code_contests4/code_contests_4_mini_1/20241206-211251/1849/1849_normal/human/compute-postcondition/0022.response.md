The line of code `right -= ans[p]` decreases the value of `right` by the value of `ans[p]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `right` (which is the count of ')') and `ans[p]` (which is an element from the list or array `ans` at index `p`). 

Assuming `ans[p]` is a defined integer, the new value of `right` will be `right - ans[p]`. The values of `left`, `sh`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the modified value of `right` after decrementing it by `ans[p]`, while other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`left` is the count of '(', `right` is decreased by ans[p], `sh` is the count of '#', `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is the next element in `s`.**
