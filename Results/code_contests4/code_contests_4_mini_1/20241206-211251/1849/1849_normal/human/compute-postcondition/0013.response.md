Postcondition: ***`left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')'. If `i` is equal to ')', then `right` is decreased by 1, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list of size `sh` with `sh - 1` ones followed by `abs(right - sh - 1)`, `p` is 0, `s` is a non-empty sequence, and `j` is 0. Otherwise, `right` is decremented by `ans[p]`, `sh` remains the count of '#', `ans` is still a list of size `sh` with `sh - 1` ones followed by `abs(right - sh - 1)`, `p` is 1, `s` is a non-empty sequence, `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to ')'.***
