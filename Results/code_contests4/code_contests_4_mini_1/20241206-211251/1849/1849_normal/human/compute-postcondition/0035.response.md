Postcondition: ***`left`, `right`, and `sh` are counts of '(', ')', and '#' respectively. If `i` is '(', then `left` is decremented by 1 while `right` and `sh` remain unchanged, and `j` is less than the length of `s` with `i` as the next element in `s`. If `i` is ')', then `right` is decremented by 1, `sh` remains unchanged, and `j` is less than the length of `s` with `i` as the next element in `s`. Otherwise, `right` is decreased by `ans[p]`, `sh` remains unchanged, `j` is less than the length of `s`, `i` is the next element in `s`, and `p` is increased by 1.***
