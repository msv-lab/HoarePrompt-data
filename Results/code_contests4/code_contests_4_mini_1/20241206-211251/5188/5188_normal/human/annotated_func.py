#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and a * b ≥ 2.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a > b) :
        return a - b
        #The program returns the difference between integers 'a' and 'b', where 'a' is greater than 'b' and both are in the range of 1 to 10^9.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `a * b` ≥ 2, and `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
    return b - a
    #The program returns the difference between integers `b` and `a`, where `a` is less than or equal to `b` and both are constrained between 1 and 10^9 with their product being at least 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, both constrained to the range 1 to 10^9 with the condition that their product is at least 2. It returns the difference between the two integers, which is calculated as `a - b` if `a` is greater than `b`, or `b - a` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. This effectively returns the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
