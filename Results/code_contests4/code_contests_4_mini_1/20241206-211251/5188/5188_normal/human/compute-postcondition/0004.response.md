The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \times b \geq 2\). 

After executing the function body, if `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns the difference \(a - b\). If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the function returns the difference \(b - a\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return the absolute difference between them, depending on their relative sizes while adhering to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the absolute difference between `a` and `b` based on their relative values.**
