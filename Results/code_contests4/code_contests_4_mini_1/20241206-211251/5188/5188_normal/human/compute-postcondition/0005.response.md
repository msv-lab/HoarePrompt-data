Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, both constrained to the range 1 to 10^9 with the condition that their product is at least 2. It returns the difference between the two integers, which is calculated as `a - b` if `a` is greater than `b`, or `b - a` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. This effectively returns the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. **
