To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it correctly handles all potential cases.

The task is to find the minimum number of bad cells one has to visit to go from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) on an infinite checkered field, where certain squares are considered "bad" based on the provided conditions involving parameters a and b.

Here is a breakdown of the program:

1. The function `func_1(c, d)` is defined to compute the integer division `c / d`. However, since it is not explicitly handling negative numbers correctly for integer division, it can lead to unexpected results.
2. It calculates `aa` and `aaa`, which represent the positions (x1+y1) and (x2+y2) divided by `2a`, respectively.
3. Similarly, it calculates `bb` and `bbb` for the positions (x1-y1) and (x2-y2) divided by `2b`.
4. The program computes the absolute differences between these values (`ans1` and `ans2`) and then prints the maximum of these two differences as the result.

### Problems in the Code:
- The integer division used in `func_1` does not round towards zero for negative values, which can lead to incorrect calculations.
- The logic of calculating the `ans1` and `ans2` does not accurately represent the number of bad squares encountered. It merely computes the difference in the quotient of positions divided by 2a and 2b, which isn't guaranteed to reflect the actual number of bad cells on the path.
  
### Test Case where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
2 2 1 0 0 1
```
The expected output is `1`, as indicated in the problem description. However, based on the logic of the program, it may return a different value due to incorrect handling of integer division and the calculation logic not accounting for all bad squares effectively.

### Conclusion:
Since the logic of the program does not guarantee the correct output for at least one input case and there's a clear flaw in the integer division handling, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
