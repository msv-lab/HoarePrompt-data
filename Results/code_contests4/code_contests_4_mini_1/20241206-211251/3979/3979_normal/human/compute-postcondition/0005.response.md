Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `c` and `d`. It returns the result of `c` divided by `d`. If `c` is non-negative, it directly returns `c / d`. If `c` is negative, it still returns `c / d`. The function does not handle division by zero, which could lead to a runtime error if `d` is zero. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `d` is not zero before calling this function to avoid potential errors. **
