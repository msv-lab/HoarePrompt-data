The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `c` and `d`. Both `c` and `d` are integers. 

- In Case_1, if `c` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns the result of `c` divided by `d`. The specific output value depends on the value of `d`.
- In Case_2, if `c` is a negative integer, the function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`, with `d` also needing to be defined or initialized within the program context.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `c` and `d` and return the result of their division based on the sign of `c` while considering the initialization of `d`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `c` and `d`, and returns the result of `c` divided by `d`, with different behavior if `c` is negative or non-negative.**
