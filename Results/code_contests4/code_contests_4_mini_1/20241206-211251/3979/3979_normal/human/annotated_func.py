#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(c, d):
    if (c >= 0) :
        return c / d
        #The program returns the result of c divided by d, where c is greater than or equal to 0. The specific value of d is not provided, hence the output cannot be determined without it.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are integers such that 2 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers such that |`x1`|, |`y1`|, |`x2`|, |`y2`| ≤ 10^9; and `c` is a negative integer (i.e., `c < 0`).
    return c / d
    #The program returns the result of dividing a negative integer 'c' by 'd', where 'd' must be defined or initialized in the program context.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `c` and `d`. It returns the result of `c` divided by `d`. If `c` is non-negative, it directly returns `c / d`. If `c` is negative, it still returns `c / d`. The function does not handle division by zero, which could lead to a runtime error if `d` is zero. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `d` is not zero before calling this function to avoid potential errors.
