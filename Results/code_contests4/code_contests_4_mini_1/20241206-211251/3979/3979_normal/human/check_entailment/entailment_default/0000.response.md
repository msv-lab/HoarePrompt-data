To assess the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code and the hints carefully.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of "bad" squares visited while moving from a starting square (x1, y1) to a target square (x2, y2). A square is deemed "bad" if either of the following conditions is satisfied:
1. |x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a)
2. |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b)

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads the input values a, b, x1, y1, x2, and y2.
2. It defines a helper function `func_1(c, d)` that computes the integer division of `c` by `d`.
3. It calculates two values (`ans1` and `ans2`) based on the differences in sums and differences of the x and y coordinates, respectively, and uses these to determine the maximum of the two as the result.

### Output Hints:
The hints indicate that the function does not handle division by zero, which is a critical flaw. Although `d` (which is `2 * a` or `2 * b`) is guaranteed to be non-zero since `a` and `b` are both at least 2, the hint suggests a broader concern about the robustness of the function.

### Edge Cases:
- **Division by Zero**: If `d` were to be zero, the division would raise a runtime error. However, given the constraints (2 ≤ a, b) this specific case won't happen. Still, the output hints note a lack of error handling which is relevant for code quality.
- **General Cases**: The code appears to be calculating the number of bad cells correctly based on the mathematical approach described, but it does not explicitly check each square between the start and end to confirm whether it is bad or not, relying instead on the calculated differences.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for all potential cases, particularly with its reliance on integer division and possible runtime errors if the constraints were different. Furthermore, the solution does not directly validate every square in the path taken, which could lead to incorrect results if there are unexpected behaviors or edge cases not covered by the mathematical assumptions.

Thus, even though the logic seems to provide a path based on the calculations, the lack of comprehensive checks and error handling makes it fall short of the requirements for correctness.

Correctness: **False**.
