Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of bad cells visited while moving from one square to another on an infinite checkered field. However, the function `func_1` does not implement any logic related to this problem. Instead, it simply performs division on two integers and does not take into account the coordinates or the conditions that define a "bad" square.

Key reasons for the incorrectness:
1. **Lack of logic for bad squares**: The function does not contain any logic to determine whether a cell is bad based on the provided conditions (|x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a) or |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b)).
2. **No pathfinding mechanism**: The function does not implement any pathfinding logic to calculate the minimum number of bad cells encountered while moving from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).
3. **Parameters mismatch**: The function parameters `c` and `d` do not relate to the problem's parameters (a, b, x1, y1, x2, y2). The function should be designed to accept these specific inputs.

In summary, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description, thus it is incorrect.
