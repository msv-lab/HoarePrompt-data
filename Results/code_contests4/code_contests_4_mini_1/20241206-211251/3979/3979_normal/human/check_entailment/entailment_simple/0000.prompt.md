You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an infinite checkered field. You should get from a square (x1; y1) to a square (x2; y2). Using the shortest path is not necessary. You can move on the field squares in four directions. That is, when you are positioned in any square, you can move to any other side-neighboring one. 

A square (x; y) is considered bad, if at least one of the two conditions is fulfilled:

  * |x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a),
  * |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b).



Your task is to find the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit on the way from (x1; y1) to (x2; y2).

Input

The only line contains integers a, b, x1, y1, x2 and y2 — the parameters of the bad squares, the coordinates of the initial and the final squares correspondingly (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 109 and |x1|,|y1|,|x2|,|y2| ≤ 109). It is guaranteed that the initial and the final square aren't bad.

Output

Print a single number — the minimum number of bad cells that one will have to visit in order to travel from square (x1; y1) to square (x2; y2).

Note

In the third sample one of the possible paths in (3;-1)->(3;0)->(3;1)->(3;2)->(4;2)->(4;3)->(4;4)->(4;5)->(4;6)->(4;7)->(3;7). Squares (3;1) and (4;4) are bad.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(c, d):
    if (c >= 0) :
        return c / d
        #The program returns the result of c divided by d, where c is greater than or equal to 0. The specific value of d is not provided, hence the output cannot be determined without it.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are integers such that 2 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers such that |`x1`|, |`y1`|, |`x2`|, |`y2`| ≤ 10^9; and `c` is a negative integer (i.e., `c < 0`).
    return c / d
    #The program returns the result of dividing a negative integer 'c' by 'd', where 'd' must be defined or initialized in the program context.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
