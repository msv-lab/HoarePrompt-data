Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of "bad" squares encountered when moving from a starting position `(x1, y1)` to a destination position `(x2, y2)` on an infinite checkered field. The conditions for identifying bad squares are based on specific mathematical properties involving two integers `a` and `b`.

However, the annotated program only contains a function `func_1` that performs a division operation on two variables `c` and `d`, which are unrelated to the problem at hand. The program lacks any logic for determining the positions of bad squares, tracking movements on the grid, or calculating the minimum number of bad squares encountered during travel between the two given coordinates.

In particular, the program does not:
1. Take the parameters `a`, `b`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` as input.
2. Implement any logic to check if a square is bad based on the conditions provided.
3. Calculate the path from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` or count the bad squares visited along that path.

Therefore, the program does not address the problem as described, leading to the conclusion that its correctness is **False**.
