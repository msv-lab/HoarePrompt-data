To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the given problem description and the code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Bad Squares Conditions**:
   - A square (x, y) is bad if:
     - \( |x + y| \equiv 0 \mod 2a \)
     - \( |x - y| \equiv 0 \mod 2b \)

2. **Input**:
   - The program takes integers a, b, x1, y1, x2, y2.

3. **Output**:
   - The program should output the minimum number of bad cells visited while moving from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).

### Code Analysis:
1. The input values are read and mapped to integers.
2. The function `func_1(c, d)` is defined, which divides `c` by `d`. However, the return statement does not handle the floor operation properly for negative values.
3. The program calculates two values:
   - `aa`: the division of \( (x1 + y1) \) by \( 2a \)
   - `aaa`: the division of \( (x2 + y2) \) by \( 2a \)
   - `ans1`: the absolute difference of `aaa` and `aa`.
   - `bb`: the division of \( (x1 - y1) \) by \( 2b \)
   - `bbb`: the division of \( (x2 - y2) \) by \( 2b \)
   - `ans2`: the absolute difference of `bbb` and `bb`.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Division**: The division operator `/` in Python performs floating-point division. The expected behavior is to count the number of bad squares, which implies integer division (floor division). The correct operator for integer division is `//`.
2. **Logic for Counting Bad Cells**: The logic implemented in the code does not accurately compute the number of bad cells traversed. The calculation of `ans1` and `ans2` might not correspond to the actual path taken and could potentially return a wrong count of bad cells.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Let's consider the input case:
```
Input: 2 2 1 0 0 1
```
- The expected output is `1` since there is one bad cell to traverse.
- However, due to the division and the way the logic is structured, the code could yield an incorrect count.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues with division and the overall logic not correctly calculating the number of bad cells based on the conditions defined in the problem description, the program does not fulfill the requirements correctly.

Correctness: **False**
