Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer; `ai` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `bi` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `f` is modified to remove ' 0 '; `s` is modified to replace ' 0 ' with ' '; `ff` is the second element of the modified list `f`; `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in `s`; `s` is assigned the value ' ' + `s[ss:-1]` + `s[:ss]`. If `s` is equal to `f`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, `s` is not equal to `f` and 'NO' is printed.***
