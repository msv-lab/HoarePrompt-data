Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `ai` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is in the range 0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1, and exactly one element is 0; `bi` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is in the range 0 ≤ bi ≤ n - 1, and exactly one element is 0; `f` is a string formed by concatenating a space, the input from `raw_input()`, and another space.**
