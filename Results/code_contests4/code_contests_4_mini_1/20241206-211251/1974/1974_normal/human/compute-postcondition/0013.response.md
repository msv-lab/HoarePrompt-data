The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, it utilizes two lists `ai` and `bi`, both of which meet specific constraints. The list `ai` contains `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 0 and `n - 1`, and exactly one element is 0. The list `bi` similarly contains `n` distinct integers with the same range and also includes exactly one element that is 0.

After executing the function body, it performs some operations based on these lists. However, we need to focus on the return value. The function returns a result that depends on the provided lists `ai` and `bi`.

Functionality: **The function utilizes two lists, `ai` and `bi`, both containing `n` distinct integers with specific constraints, and returns a result based on the processing of these lists.**
