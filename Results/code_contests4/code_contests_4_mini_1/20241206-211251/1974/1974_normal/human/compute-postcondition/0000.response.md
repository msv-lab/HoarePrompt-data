The code assigns the value of `input()` to `n`. However, since `n` is initially defined as an integer with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, the output state will reflect that `n` is now an input value rather than a specific integer. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `ai` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is in the range 0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1, and exactly one element is 0; `bi` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is in the range 0 ≤ bi ≤ n - 1, and exactly one element is 0.**
