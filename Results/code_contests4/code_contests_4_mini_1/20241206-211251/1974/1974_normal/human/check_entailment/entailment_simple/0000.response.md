Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the statues can be rearranged as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 and does not properly handle the input format as specified. This would lead to a runtime error in Python 3 environments.

2. **Statue Movement Logic**: The program attempts to determine if the statues can be rearranged by checking if the modified list `s` (representing the desired statue arrangement after shifting statues) matches the modified list `f` (the current arrangement without the empty pedestal). However, this logic only checks for a specific rotation of the list, which is insufficient for determining if the statues can be rearranged in any order. 

3. **Cycle Movement**: The problem states that only adjacent statues can be moved to the empty pedestal. The logic in the code does not account for this requirement adequately. It does not simulate the possible movements of the statues and instead relies on a string match to check for equivalence, which does not capture the necessary conditions for valid moves.

4. **Example Cases**: The program fails for cases where the desired arrangement cannot be achieved just through direct rotations of the list. For instance, with input `4, 1 2 3 0, 0 3 2 1`, the program would incorrectly return "YES" because it only checks for rotations rather than valid movements, which is not possible in this case.

Overall, the logic implemented does not cover all the requirements of the problem, particularly around the mechanics of moving statues and the constraints of adjacency in the cycle of islands. The program does not ensure that the desired arrangement is achievable through valid moves.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
