The function accepts an integer `n` and two lists `ai` and `bi` of `n` distinct integers, where each list contains numbers in the range from 0 to `n-1` with exactly one element being 0. It processes these lists by removing the 0 and checking if the modified list `s` can be rotated to match the modified list `f`. If the modified list `s` is equal to the modified list `f`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
