To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the intended behavior of the program and see if it matches the requirements specified in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program takes three integers: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where:
   - `n` is the number of rows (even number, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
   - `m` is the number of columns (2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9).
   - `k` is the number of moves Lara has made (0 ≤ k < n * m).
   
2. **Movement Pattern**:
   - Lara starts at (1, 1).
   - She moves down to the bottom of the first column (to (n, 1)).
   - Then she moves in a "snake-like" fashion:
     - First, she goes right until she reaches the end of the row.
     - Then she moves up one row and goes left, and this continues until all cells are visited.
     
3. **Output**: The program should output the final cell (row, column) where Lara ends up after `k` moves.

### Program Analysis:
- The first conditional `if (k - n <= -1)` checks if `k` is less than `n`. If true, it means Lara is still in the first column after moving down. The program prints `(1, k + 1)`, which is correct since it reflects her position in the first column.

- If `k >= n`, Lara has completed her downward movement and started moving in the snake-like fashion:
  - The line `k -= n` adjusts `k` to reflect the moves made after reaching the bottom of the first column.
  - The calculation of `t` (full rows completed) and `p` (position in the current row) is done using integer division and modulus with respect to `(m - 1)` (the number of horizontal moves per complete row).
  - The logic `y = n - t` calculates the row position based on how many full rows Lara has completed.
  - The logic for `x` uses a conditional to determine whether she is moving left or right based on the parity of the completed rows.

- **Potential Issues**: The program uses integer division (`/`) which in Python 2.x (implied by `raw_input()`) would perform floor division. However, since this code is intended for Python 3.x and above, it should use `//` for integer division. The `math.ceil()` call is unnecessary since `y` is already calculated as an integer.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly computes Lara's position based on the number of moves `k` taking into account the snake-like traversal through the matrix.
- No corner cases in the problem description are violated, and the calculations seem to align with the expected output positions.

**Final Verdict**: The program correctly implements the logic as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
