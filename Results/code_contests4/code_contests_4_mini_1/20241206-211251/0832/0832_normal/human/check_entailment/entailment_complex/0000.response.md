To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and functionality step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Lara starts at the top-left corner of a matrix (1, 1).
2. She moves down to the bottom-left corner (n, 1).
3. Then she moves in a snake-like fashion:
   - Move right along the last column.
   - Move one cell up.
   - Move left in the second column.
   - Move one cell up, and so on until she ends up back at (1, 2).
4. The program needs to determine her position after `k` moves.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n`, `m`, and `k` correctly.
2. **Initial Position**: It initializes the starting position as `(1, 1)` which is correct.
3. **First Condition**:
   - If `k < n`, the program prints `(1, k + 1)`. This is accurate for the first `n` moves because Lara will still be in the first column.
4. **After the First Column**:
   - Once Lara reaches the bottom of the first column (after `n` moves), she will start moving in a snake-like manner.
   - The calculation of `k -= n` adjusts `k` to represent moves made after reaching `(n, 1)`.
5. **Calculating `t` and `p`**:
   - `t` computes how many full rows of snake-like moves Lara has completed after the first column.
   - `p` computes the position within the current row.
6. **Position Calculation**:
   - `y` is derived as `n - t`, which correctly identifies the current row based on the completed snake moves.
   - `x` is conditionally assigned based on the parity of `t`, which reflects the snake-like movement correctly (even `t` means moving right, odd means moving left).
7. **Final Output**: The program prints the calculated position which should be `(y, x)`.

### Verification of Edge Cases:
- **Edge case when `k = 0`**: The output will be `(1, 1)`, which is correct.
- **Edge case when `k = n - 1`**: The output will still be in the first column, correctly showing the last position in the first column.
- **Edge case when `k` is a maximum valid value**: The program handles large values of `k` correctly due to its mathematical calculations, ensuring it stays within the bounds of the matrix dimensions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine Lara's position based on the rules described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the movement rules stated.

Correctness: **True**
