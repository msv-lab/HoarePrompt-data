To analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `m` are integers from `raw_input()`. (Values are not specified but they will be integers)
   - `k` is modified as `k - n`. (The new value of `k` is dependent on the initial value of `k` and `n`.)
   - `y` is calculated as `n - (k / (m - 1))`. (This uses the updated value of `k` and the value of `n` and `m`.)
   - `x` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is even, or `m - (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is odd. (The value of `x` depends on the parity of `t`.)

2. **Execution of the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement outputs the values of `y` and `x`. However, it does not modify any variables.

Now, since we don't have specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t`, we can only state the relationships and the dependencies among these variables.

Thus, the Output State would include the computed values of `y` and `x` based on the above calculations without exact numerical values.

Output State: **`y` is `n - (k / (m - 1))`, `x` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is even or `m - (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is odd**.
