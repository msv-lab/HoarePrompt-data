To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the effect of the print statement given the defined variables.

1. Variables `n` and `m` are integers obtained from `raw_input()`.
2. `k` is modified to `k - n`.
3. `p` is defined as `k % (m - 1)`.
4. `t` is defined as `k / (m - 1)`.
5. `y` is calculated as `n - t`.
6. `x` is either `2 + p` (if `t` is even) or `m - p` (if `t` is odd).

The print statement outputs two values: `int(math.ceil(y))` and `int(x)`.

Since we don't have specific values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, we cannot determine the exact numeric outcomes for `y` and `x`. However, we can summarize what these variables represent based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers from `raw_input()`, `k` is now `k - n`, `y` is `n - (k / (m - 1))`, `x` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is even or `m - (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is odd; output will be int(math.ceil(y)), int(x)**
