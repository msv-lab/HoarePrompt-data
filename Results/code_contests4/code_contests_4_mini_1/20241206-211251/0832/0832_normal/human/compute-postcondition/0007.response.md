The value of `k` is decremented by `n`, which means `k` is now `k - n`. Since the condition `k - n` is checked to see if it is less than or equal to -1, we need to consider that case. However, based on the current operation alone, we only know that `k` has been updated. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers assigned from `raw_input()`, `k` is now `k - n`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers assigned from `raw_input()`, `k` is now `k - n`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
