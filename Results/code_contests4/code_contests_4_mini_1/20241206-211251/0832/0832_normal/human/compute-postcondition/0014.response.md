The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are integers satisfying the conditions 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, with `n` always being even. Additionally, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m. The return value of the function is not specified in the output provided. Therefore, without further details on the output of the function, we cannot define the specific functionality. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters explicitly but relies on the constraints that n and m are integers (with n even) and k is a non-negative integer within a specific range. The return value is unspecified.**
