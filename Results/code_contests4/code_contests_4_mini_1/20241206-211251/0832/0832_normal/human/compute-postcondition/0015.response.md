Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from input, where `n` is an even integer and `2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9`, and `0 ≤ k < n * m`. If `k` is less than `n`, it prints the values `y` (which is initially 1) and `k + 1`, then exits. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it computes new values for `k`, `t`, `p`, `y`, and `x`, where `y` is derived based on `k` and `t`, and `x` is calculated conditionally based on the parity of `t`. Finally, it prints the ceiling of `y` and `x`, followed by the values of `y` and `x`. The function does not have a structured return but produces output based on the calculations performed.**
