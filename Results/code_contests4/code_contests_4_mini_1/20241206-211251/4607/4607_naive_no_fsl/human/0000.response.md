To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in light of the problem description. 

### Problem Understanding
The problem requests us to find out all possible integers that can be added to a set of integers (cards) such that the new set can form an arithmetic progression (AP). 

### Key Conditions
1. If there is only one card, the output should be `-1` because an infinite number of values can be added to create an AP.
2. For two cards, if they are equal, we can also add the same number (i.e., the value of the card).
3. For more than two cards, we need to check the differences between consecutive cards:
   - If there are more than two distinct differences between the cards, it is impossible to form an AP.
   - If there is only one distinct difference, we can add one number that fits the pattern at either end.
   - If there are exactly two distinct differences, we check if one can be derived from the other (i.e., if the difference can be halved).

### Analyzing the Code
Now we will check if the provided code adheres to these rules and handles all corner cases correctly.

1. **Single Card Case**: The logic correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by returning `-1`.
2. **Two Cards Case**: It checks if both cards are equal, returning `1` and the value of the card if they are. It also calculates potential values correctly based on differences.
3. **Multiple Cards Case**:
   - It collects the differences between the cards and checks the distinct differences.
   - If more than 2 distinct differences, it returns `0`, which is correct.
   - If only 1 distinct difference, it calculates potential values for the edges correctly.
   - If exactly 2 distinct differences, it checks if they can be halved and returns the correct values accordingly.

### Testing Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases:

1. **Case with all cards being the same**: `n=3` with cards `[5, 5, 5]`. The program should return `1` and `5`.
2. **Case with two cards but different**: `n=2` with cards `[2, 5]`. The program should return `3` and the values `1, 3, 8`.
3. **Case with more than two distinct differences**: `n=4` with cards `[1, 2, 4, 7]`. The program should return `0`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the implementation against the problem description and considering various edge cases, the code seems to cover all scenarios correctly. 

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
