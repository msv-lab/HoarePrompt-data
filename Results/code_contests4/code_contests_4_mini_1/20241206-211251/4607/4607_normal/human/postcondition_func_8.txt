The function accepts an integer `n`, a list `m` of size `n` containing positive integers, and another integer `num`. It returns a matrix of size `n x m`, where each row contains the integer `num` repeated `m` times, where `m` is the value of each element in the list `m`. This means the output matrix will have `n` rows, and the number of columns in each row will vary based on the corresponding value from the list `m`, which is not accurately captured in the annotations.
