The function accepts an integer `n` in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and returns a list of integers representing the individual digits of `n`. Each digit is derived from the number `n` and converted into an integer. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range, but since the input is constrained, it will always return a valid list of digits for any valid input.
