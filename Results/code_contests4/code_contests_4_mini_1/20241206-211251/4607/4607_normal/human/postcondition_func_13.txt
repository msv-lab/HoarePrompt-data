The function accepts an integer `x` and a list `y` of positive integers. It repeatedly assigns `y` the value of `x` and `x` the remainder of `x` divided by `y` until `y` becomes empty. The function ultimately returns the last non-empty integer value of `x`, not a list, which corresponds to the last computed value before `y` becomes empty.
