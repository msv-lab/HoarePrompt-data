The function accepts no parameters and returns the result of `func_3()` as a list. The processing involves a sequence of positive integers, which are the values on Alexander's cards, with the requirement that these integers do not exceed 10^8. The function does not handle any specific edge cases, such as errors that could arise from `func_3()`, nor does it validate the input or ensure it adheres to the stated constraints.
