The function accepts a tuple `item`, where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cards, and the second element is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the list of positive integers from the tuple `item`. There are no additional checks or conditions applied to the input, and the function directly returns the list without any modifications.
