To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description regarding arithmetic progressions and the number of integers that can be added to make the sequence an arithmetic progression, I will analyze the code, annotations, and examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to identify how many integers can be added to the existing integers on the cards so that they can form an arithmetic progression (AP).
   - The output varies based on the input: 
     - If infinitely many integers can be added, print `-1`.
     - If no integer can be added, print `0`.
     - Otherwise, print the count of valid integers followed by the integers themselves.

2. **Input Constraints**:
   - `n` (the number of cards) is between `1` and `100,000`.
   - Each integer does not exceed `10^8`.

3. **Key Observations from Annotations**:
   - The function `func_17` is crucial as it contains the main logic to determine the valid integers.
   - The program handles specific cases:
     - If `n == 1`, it correctly identifies that infinitely many integers can be added (output `-1`).
     - If `n == 2`, it checks the equality and computes potential integers based on the difference.
     - If there are more than two distinct differences among consecutive integers, it outputs `0`.

4. **Checking Edge Cases**:
   - For a single card, it returns `-1`. This is correct since any number can be added.
   - For two cards, if they are equal, it should return both the same number and the numbers calculated based on the differences for AP.
   - The handling of three or more cards must ensure that the differences are either the same or can be adjusted by adding a number to form an AP.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not seem to correctly handle all cases where the differences might not align well to form a valid AP. Particularly, if the input cards create a complex pattern of differences that don't fit neatly into AP rules, the handling might not be robust.
   - Specifically, the check for more than two distinct differences (`len(list(set(g))) > 2`) might not cover all valid cases, especially when dealing with negative or very large numbers.

### Conclusion:

The program does not consistently account for all cases as required by the problem statement. Specifically, the conditions under which it determines the existence of valid integers to add might miss certain edge cases, leading to incorrect outputs. For instance, it might incorrectly output `0` when valid integers can still be added to form an AP.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**

**Explanation**: The program fails to correctly handle all potential cases for forming an arithmetic progression, particularly in scenarios where the differences between card values do not align neatly according to the established rules. This could lead to incorrect outputs in some cases.
