Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why it does not fulfill the problem's criteria:

1. **Functional Validation**: The program lacks a cohesive implementation that directly addresses the task of determining the valid integers that can be added to Alexander's cards to form an arithmetic progression. While there are many functions defined, they do not work together to provide a solution to the problem as described.

2. **Missing Logic**: The key logic to compute the possible integers that can be added to the existing cards to form an arithmetic progression is not present. Specifically, the program should:
   - Handle cases where `n = 1` by outputting `-1` (indicating infinite possibilities).
   - For `n = 2`, properly calculate the possible numbers based on the difference between the two cards.
   - For `n > 2`, check the differences between cards and ensure they can be made equal with the addition of one new card.

3. **Output Mechanism**: The function `func_18()` is supposed to print the results, but the results of the calculations that determine the valid integers are not appropriately passed to it. The program should also ensure that the output format matches the requirements (i.e., the count of valid integers followed by the integers themselves).

4. **Logic Flaws**: There are logical issues in how the differences between card values are computed and assessed. For example, the handling of cases where the differences aren't uniform is not adequately addressed. The program does not correctly determine when a valid integer can be added to make the progression.

Due to these issues, the program is not a correct implementation of the problem as stated.
