To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code against the problem description regarding arithmetic progressions.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find a number that can be added to a given sequence of integers (cards) such that the entire sequence can be rearranged into an arithmetic progression. The program should also handle specific cases:
1. If there are infinitely many valid integers, print `-1`.
2. If no integers can be added to form a valid arithmetic progression, print `0`.
3. Otherwise, print the count of valid integers and the integers themselves.

### Code Analysis:
The main function in the provided code is `func_17`, which deals with various cases based on the number of cards and their values:
- If there is only one card, it prints `-1` because any number added will allow for infinite possibilities.
- If there are two cards, it checks if they are equal and prints accordingly.
- For more than two cards, it computes the differences between consecutive cards and determines if they can form an arithmetic progression by checking the uniqueness of these differences.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Card**: If there is only one card, the function handles it correctly by outputting `-1`.
2. **Two Cards**: For two cards, the logic correctly identifies cases where both cards are equal or where they can form an arithmetic progression.
3. **Three or More Cards**: The logic becomes more complex, where the function checks for distinct differences. It must ensure that it correctly identifies scenarios where the differences can be uniform or where a valid integer can be inserted.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints provide insight into the expected behavior of the functions. They describe the conditions under which the function will return specific results. The hints seem to support the idea that the function may not account for certain edge cases, especially concerning the number of distinct differences.

For instance, the check for `len(list(set(g))) > 2` means that if there are more than two distinct differences, no valid integer can be formed, which is correct per the problem statement. However, if the differences are not handled adequately when there are exactly two distinct differences, this could lead to incorrect results.

### Final Assessment:
Considering all cases, the code does handle the basic requirements of the problem description. However, there are potential pitfalls in how the distinct differences are calculated, especially in the case of sequences that have the same number repeated (like `[4, 4, 4]`, which should return `0` but may not be handled correctly).

Thus, while the code appears to handle many cases well, the complexity of handling distinct differences and ensuring that all possible valid integers are returned indicates that there may be scenarios where the program does not work correctly. 

Therefore, based on the analysis of the problem description, the code logic, and the hints provided, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

### Example of Incorrectness:
For the input `[4, 4, 4]`, the code should return `0`, indicating that no integers can be added to make an arithmetic progression. However, the logic may not cover this case adequately, leading to incorrect behavior.
