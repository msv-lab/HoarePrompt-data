The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of cards. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returns `True` if `n` is 2 or 3, and returns `False` if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For values of `n` greater than 3 that are not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks for factors starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`. If no factors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. If any factors are found, it returns `False`.
