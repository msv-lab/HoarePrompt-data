Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `x` is `a[0] + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`; `a` now contains its original elements plus one new element `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` appended to it.**
