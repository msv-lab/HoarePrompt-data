Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`. If the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not equal to `gc`, then `x` is calculated as `a[2] + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, `a` is modified by appending a new value, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
