To analyze the impact of the code snippet `l.append(a[i + 1] - a[i])` on the given initial state:

1. The variable `i` is currently 2.
2. Therefore, `i + 1` equals 3.
3. The code snippet appends the value of `a[3] - a[2]` to the list `l`.
4. The list `l` will now contain all its previous elements plus one additional element that is the result of the subtraction `a[3] - a[2]`.

Since we know that `l` contained the previous elements plus `a[2] - a[1]`, the new state of `l` will reflect this addition.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains the previous elements plus the value of `a[2] - a[1] and a[3] - a[2], `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`, `i` is 2, `a` is sorted**.
