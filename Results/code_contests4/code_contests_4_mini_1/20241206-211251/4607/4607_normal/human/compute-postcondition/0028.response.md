According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`. The loop will run for `n - 1` iterations, which means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. If `n` is 1, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

Given that the initial state specifies `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2. 

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it will start at 0 and will increase by 1 with each iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted as follows: `n` must be at least 2, and `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
