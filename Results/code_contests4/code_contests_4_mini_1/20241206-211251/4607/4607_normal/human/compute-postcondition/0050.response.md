Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, and `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`. There are more than 1 distinct elements in `g` (i.e., `len(list(set(g)))` is greater than 1).***
