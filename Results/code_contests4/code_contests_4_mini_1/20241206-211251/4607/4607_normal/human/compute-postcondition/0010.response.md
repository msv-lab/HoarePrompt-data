The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The execution of this code does not alter the values of the variables `n`, `args`, `x`, or `at_start`. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged regarding these variables. The only action taken is writing to the file.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `args` has at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `args`, `at_start` is False, and `sep` is written to the file.**
