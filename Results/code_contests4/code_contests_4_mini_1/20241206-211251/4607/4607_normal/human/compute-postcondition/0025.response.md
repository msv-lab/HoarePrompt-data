Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty iterable `args` and prints its elements to a specified output stream, separated by a specified separator `sep`. Additionally, it appends an ending character `end` (defaulting to a newline) at the end of the output. If the `flush` parameter is set to True, it flushes the output buffer. The function assumes that the constraints for `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and the values in `args` (each not exceeding 10^8) are met, but it does not enforce these constraints or handle any exceptions related to invalid input. **
