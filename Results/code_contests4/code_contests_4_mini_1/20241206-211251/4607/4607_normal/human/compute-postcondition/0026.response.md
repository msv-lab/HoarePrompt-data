The variable `g` is assigned an empty list `[]`. Since this is a direct assignment, it does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, and if `n` is equal to 2, then `a` is a sorted list of integers where the first two elements are equal, `l` contains one element equal to `a[0]`, `g` is an empty list, and the program has terminated without further execution.
