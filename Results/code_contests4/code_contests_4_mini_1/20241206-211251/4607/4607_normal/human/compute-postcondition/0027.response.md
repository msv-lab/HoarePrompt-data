The variable `l` is reassigned to an empty list. Since `l` previously contained one element equal to `a[0]`, it is now emptied, and the other variables `a`, `n`, and `g` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where the first two elements are equal, `l` is an empty list, `g` is an empty list, and the program has terminated without further execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where the first two elements are equal, `l` is an empty list, `g` is an empty list, and the program has terminated without further execution.**
