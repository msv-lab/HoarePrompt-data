According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `l`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `l` contains at least 3 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3, and for the loop to execute again, `len(l)` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains at least 3 elements with at least 2 elements, `gc` is modified by func_14(gc, l[2]), `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `len(l)` must be greater than 3**
