According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Since `n` is at least 2, it is still valid for the loop to execute again, because `i` (which will be 2) is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains the previous elements plus the value of `a[2] - a[1]`, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`, `i` is 2, `a` is sorted**
