The function `func_18` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer constrained by the condition that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). Additionally, it accepts a sequence of integers on Alexander's cards, which is a list of positive integers, with each integer not exceeding \(10^8\). The function processes these inputs and returns an unspecified output based on the logic defined within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of positive integers representing the sequence on Alexander's cards, with the constraints that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and each integer in the list does not exceed \(10^8\).**
