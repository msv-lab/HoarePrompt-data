In the initial state, `n` is at least 2, meaning that the list `a` has at least 2 elements. The variable `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`. The variable `l` currently has one element calculated as `a[0] - (a[1] - a[0])`.

The code `l.append(a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0]))` will perform the following actions:
1. `a[-1]` retrieves the last element of the list `a`.
2. `(a[1] - a[0])` calculates the difference between the second and the first elements of `a`.
3. The result combines both by adding the last element of `a` to the difference calculated.

Assuming that `a` has at least two elements, the output state will reflect the new value added to `l` without changing the values of `n`, `g`, or the existing elements in `l`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` now has one additional element calculated as `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])`.**
