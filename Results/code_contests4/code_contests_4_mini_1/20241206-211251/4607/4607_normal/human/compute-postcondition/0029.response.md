The code `g.append(a[i + 1] - a[i])` will execute and impact the variables as follows: 

- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1.
- The code accesses the list `a` at indices 1 and 0.
- The result of the expression `a[1] - a[0]` is computed and appended to the list `g`.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged; `n` is at least 2, and `i` is still 0 after the execution of the line. However, the list `g` will now include a new element, which is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `g` are not provided, I can only state the output in terms of the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `g` now contains an additional element which is `a[1] - a[0]`.**
