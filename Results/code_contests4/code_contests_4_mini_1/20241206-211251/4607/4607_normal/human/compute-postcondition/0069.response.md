The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `x` is `a[0] + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `a` now contains its original elements plus one new element `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` appended to it while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
