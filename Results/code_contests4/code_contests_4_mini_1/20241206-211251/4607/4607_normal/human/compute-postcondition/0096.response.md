Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`; `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` is sorted. If all elements in `l` are equal, the call to `func_18(1)` was made but did not change any values. If `l` contains at least two different values, `func_18(0)` is called.***
