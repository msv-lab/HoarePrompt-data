The code `l = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `l`. This action overrides the previous state of `l`, which contained `n - 1` elements. Other variables such as `n`, `g`, `gc`, `i`, and `a` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `l` has been reset to an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` is now an empty list; `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`; `i` is less than `n - 1; `a` may contain additional elements based on the condition checks within the loop; `a` is sorted.**
