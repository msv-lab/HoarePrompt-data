The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program is exiting. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`, and the number of distinct elements in `g` is greater than 2; the function `func_18(0)` is called and the program is terminated.
