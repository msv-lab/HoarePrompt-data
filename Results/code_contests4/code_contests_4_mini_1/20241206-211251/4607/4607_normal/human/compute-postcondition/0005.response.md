The code `file.write(sep)` does not alter the values of `n`, `args`, or `at_start`. It simply writes the value of `sep` to a file, which is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is False, and the file has written the value of `sep`.**
