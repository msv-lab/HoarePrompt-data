The loop processes each element in `args`, writing them to `file` with `sep` between them after the first element. The loop will execute for each element in `args`, which is a non-empty iterable, and after all iterations, `at_start` will be `False`. The `sep` will be written before every element after the first one.

If `args` contains `n` elements, the final output state will reflect that all elements have been processed and written to the file.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `at_start` is False; `sep` has been written to the file between all elements after the first; each element in `args` has been written to the file as a string.**
