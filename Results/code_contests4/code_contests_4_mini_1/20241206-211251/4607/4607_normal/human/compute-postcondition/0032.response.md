The code `g.append(a[i + 1] - a[i])` appends the result of the expression `a[i + 1] - a[i]` to the list `g`. The variable `i` is currently 1, which means we will be accessing elements `a[2]` and `a[1]`. However, the values of `a` are not provided, so we cannot compute an exact numerical result. Since `n` is greater than 2, the operation `a[i + 1] - a[i]` is valid.

Thus, the output state will indicate the relationship between `i`, `n`, and the operation being performed without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, and we append the result of `a[2] - a[1]` to the list `g`.**
