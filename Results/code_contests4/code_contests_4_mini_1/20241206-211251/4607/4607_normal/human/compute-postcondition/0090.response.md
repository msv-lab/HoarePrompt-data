The loop iterates `n` times, where each iteration calculates the difference between consecutive elements of the sorted list `a` and appends this difference to the list `l`. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute all `n` iterations. 

After the completion of all iterations, `l` will contain `n - 1` elements, which are the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` after the last iteration, and `gc` will still be modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`. 

Thus, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`; `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` is sorted.**
