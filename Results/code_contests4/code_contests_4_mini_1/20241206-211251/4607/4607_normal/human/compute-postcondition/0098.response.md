The function `func_17` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it processes a list of integers on the cards, which contains positive integers, each not exceeding 10^8. The function operates under the constraint that the number of integers `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The specific output of the function has not been provided in this case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_17` is to work with a predefined list of positive integers, each not exceeding 10^8, and handle up to 100,000 such integers.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes a predefined list of positive integers, each not exceeding 10^8, with a maximum of 100,000 integers.**
