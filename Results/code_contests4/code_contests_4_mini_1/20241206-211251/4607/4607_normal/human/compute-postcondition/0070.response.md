Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is 0, and if the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not equal to `gc`, then `x` is set to `a[0] + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and the array `a` is updated to include the new element `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`.***
