The call to `func_18(x)` does not alter any variable values based on the initial state provided. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`; `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` is sorted; all elements in `l` are equal, as the length of the set of `l` is 1; the call to `func_18(1)` was made but did not change any values.**
