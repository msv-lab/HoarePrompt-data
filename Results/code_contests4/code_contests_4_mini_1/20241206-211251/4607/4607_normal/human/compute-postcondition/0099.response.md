Functionality: ** The function processes a sorted list of positive integers derived from function calls and determines specific conditions based on the differences between consecutive integers. If there is only one integer, it calls `func_18` with -1 and terminates. If there are two equal integers, it calls `func_18` with 1 and the integer value and terminates. If there are more than two distinct differences between consecutive integers, it calls `func_18(0)` and terminates. If there are exactly two distinct differences, it calculates potential new integers to add to the list and checks whether the differences become uniform. If they do, it calls `func_18` with 1 and the new integer; otherwise, it calls `func_18(0)`. The function ultimately does not return any values but instead invokes `func_18` multiple times with various arguments based on the conditions evaluated.**
