According to the code, the loop iterates over `args`. For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must be a non-empty iterable. The provided state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and other variables are initialized, but the state of `args` is not mentioned. Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `args` is a non-empty iterable.

Additionally, since `at_start` is True, it suggests that we may want to consider the state before the loop regarding any preparatory conditions, but it does not directly impact the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `args` must be a non-empty iterable.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
