Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`, there are more than 1 distinct elements in `g`, and 0 is an element of `l`. If there are at least 2 distinct elements in `g`, the function `func_18(0)` was called, and the program terminated due to exit().***
