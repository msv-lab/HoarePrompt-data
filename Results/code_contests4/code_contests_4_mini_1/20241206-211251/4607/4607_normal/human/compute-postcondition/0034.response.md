According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 2, indicating that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `i` equal to 2. For the loop to run again, `n` must still be greater than `2`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
