To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and initial state:

1. `i` is 2, which means `a[i]` refers to `a[2]` and `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[3]`.
2. The expression `abs(a[i + 1] - a[i])` calculates the absolute difference between the values at indices 3 and 2 of list `a`.
3. The output of this expression is appended to the list `l`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `a[2]` and `a[3]`, we cannot compute a specific numerical result for the absolute difference. However, we can denote that the value appended to `l` is the absolute difference of `a[3]` and `a[2]`.

Now, we compile this information into the output state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; appended value to `l` is abs(a[3] - a[2])**.
