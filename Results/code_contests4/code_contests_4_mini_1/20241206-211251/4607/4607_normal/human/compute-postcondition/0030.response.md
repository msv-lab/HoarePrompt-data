The code `l.append(abs(a[i + 1] - a[i]))` calculates the absolute difference between the elements of the list `a` at indices `i + 1` and `i`, and appends this result to the list `l`. 

Given that `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `g` contains an additional element which is `a[1] - a[0]`, we can infer that:

- `a[1]` and `a[0]` are valid indices since `n` is at least 2.
- The value `abs(a[i + 1] - a[i])` translates to `abs(a[1] - a[0])`.

Since `g` already contains `a[1] - a[0]`, we are now appending the value `abs(a[1] - a[0])` to the list `l`.

After executing the code, the output state reflects the following:

- The list `l` will now include the absolute difference calculated from `a[1]` and `a[0]`.

Thus, the Output State is: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `g` contains an additional element which is `a[1] - a[0]`, `l` is updated to include `abs(a[1] - a[0])`.**
