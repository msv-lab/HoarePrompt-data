According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive), which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`, which means the loop has executed once. To execute the loop a second time, `i` will be incremented by `1`, so `i` will become `1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. 

Since `i` is now `1`, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `2` (because `1 < n - 1` translates to `n > 2`).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1.**
