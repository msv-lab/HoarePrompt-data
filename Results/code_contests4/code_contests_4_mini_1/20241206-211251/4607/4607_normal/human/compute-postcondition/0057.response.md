`gc` is assigned the value of `l[0]`. The value of `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`. Since there are more than 1 distinct elements in `g`, it implies that `l` must also have distinct values. Therefore, `gc` takes on the first element of `l`, which is `l[0]`. The state of other variables remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is assigned the value of `l[0]**
