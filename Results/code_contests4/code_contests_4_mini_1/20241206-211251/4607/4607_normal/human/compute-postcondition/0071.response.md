According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates `n - 1` times, and since `i` is currently 0 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has executed for the first time. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` should be increased to 1. Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1, allowing for one more iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` must not equal `gc`.**
