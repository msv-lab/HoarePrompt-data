The function `func_18` is called with an argument that is the length of the list `l`. Since `l` is sorted in ascending order with unique elements, its length will be a positive integer that is at least 1 (because `n` is at least 2, which means `g` has at least 1 element). 

The output state reflects the values of `n`, `g`, and `l` as well as the fact that the function returns a value based on the length of `l`. However, the specific returned value from `func_18` is not defined in this context, so we state that the length has been passed to the function.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` is now sorted in ascending order with unique elements; `func_18` is called with the length of `l`.**
