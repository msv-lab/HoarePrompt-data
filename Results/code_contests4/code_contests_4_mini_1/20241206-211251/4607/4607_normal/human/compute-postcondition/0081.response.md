Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `a` may contain additional elements based on the condition checks within the loop. If the loop executes, `a` contains elements where each new element is calculated as `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` for the first instance where the condition is met. If the loop does not execute, `a` remains unchanged.**
