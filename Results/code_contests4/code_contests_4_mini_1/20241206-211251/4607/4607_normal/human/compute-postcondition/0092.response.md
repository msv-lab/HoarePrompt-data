The code `func_18(1)` is called, but the specific impact of this function on the program is not defined in the provided information. Since `func_18` does not modify any of the previously stated variables directly according to the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`; `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` is sorted; all elements in `l` are equal, as the length of the set of `l` is 1; the call to `func_18(1)` was made but did not change any values.
