The value of `l` is modified by appending the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` to it. Since `i` is 1, the elements being accessed are `a[2]` and `a[1]`. The length of `l` previously had `n - 1` elements, and this operation will increase the size of `l` by 1. The values of `n`, `g`, `gc`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains the previous elements plus the value of `a[2] - a[1]`, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`, `i` is 1, `a` is sorted.
