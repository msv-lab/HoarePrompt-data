The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2; `i` is 2; `x` is calculated as `a[2] + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2; a` is modified by appending a new value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
