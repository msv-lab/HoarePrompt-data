Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, and `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`. If there are more than 2 distinct elements in `g`, the function `func_18(0)` is called and the program is terminated.***
