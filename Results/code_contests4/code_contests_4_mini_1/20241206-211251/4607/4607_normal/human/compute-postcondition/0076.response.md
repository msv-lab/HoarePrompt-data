According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, which means `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Now, if `i` is incremented, it becomes 2. As long as `2` is still less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 3**.
