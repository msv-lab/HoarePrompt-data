The value of `x` is calculated as `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `x` uses the values of `a[1]` and `a[2]`. After calculating `x`, the code appends this value to the list `a`. The previous values of `a` are not specified, but the length of `a` will increase by 1 due to the append operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is 1, and `a` has one additional element which is `a[1] + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.
