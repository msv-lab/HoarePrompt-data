According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, becoming 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`, `i` is 1, `a` is sorted, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
