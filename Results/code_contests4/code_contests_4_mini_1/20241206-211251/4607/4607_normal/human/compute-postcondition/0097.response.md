Postcondition: ***If `g` contains only one distinct element, then `n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` is sorted in ascending order with unique elements, and `func_18` is called with the length of `l`. If `g` contains more than one distinct element, then `n` is at least 2; `g` still contains `n - 1` elements; `l` retains its elements representing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`; `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to the previous elements in `l`; `i` is set to `n - 1`; `a` is sorted. If all elements in `l` are equal, `func_18(1)` was called but did not change any values; if `l` contains at least two different values, `func_18(0)` is called.***
