The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is 1, and `a` has one additional element which is `a[1] + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
