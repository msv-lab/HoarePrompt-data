Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is False, `sep` has been written to the file between all elements after the first, and a value has been written to the file (either specified by `kwargs['end']` or a newline character). If the flush parameter has been popped from kwargs and its value is True, the file buffer is flushed.***
