Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `x` is the next element in `args`, `at_start` is False, and `sep` has been written to the file. If `at_start` is False, the conditions of `n`, `x`, and `sep` remain valid, allowing the loop to potentially execute a second time if `args` has at least one more element after the current `x`.***
