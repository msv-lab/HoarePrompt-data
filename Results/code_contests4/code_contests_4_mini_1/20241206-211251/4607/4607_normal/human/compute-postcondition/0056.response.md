Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`, and there are more than 1 distinct elements in `g`. If 0 is an element of `l`, then the function `func_18(0)` is called, and the program terminates.***
