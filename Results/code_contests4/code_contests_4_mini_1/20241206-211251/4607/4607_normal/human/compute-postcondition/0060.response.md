According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `l`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` contains `n - 1` elements, which is at least 2 since `n` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 which makes `i` equal to 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, the length of `l` must be greater than `i` (which is now 2). Since `l` has at least 2 elements, it must have at least 3 elements to satisfy this condition.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains at least 3 elements with at least 2 elements, `gc` is modified by func_14(gc, l[1]), `i` is 2**
