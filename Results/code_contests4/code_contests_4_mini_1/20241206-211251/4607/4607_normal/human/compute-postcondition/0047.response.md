The `l.sort()` method sorts the list `l` in ascending order. Since `l` contains unique elements derived from its previous state, the sorting will arrange those unique elements without duplicates. The values of `n` and `g` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` is now sorted in ascending order with unique elements.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` is now sorted in ascending order with unique elements.**
