The operation `l = list(set(l))` converts the list `l` into a set to remove duplicates and then converts it back into a list. The previous state indicates that `l` has one additional element calculated as `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])`, and since `n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements. The specific content of `l` is not provided, but we know it will be modified to contain unique elements.

The output state reflects that `l` has now been updated to only contain unique elements, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `g` contains `n - 1` elements; `l` now contains unique elements derived from its previous state.**
