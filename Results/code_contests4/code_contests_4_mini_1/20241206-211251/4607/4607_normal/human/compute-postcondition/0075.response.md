Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `gc` is modified by applying `func_14` to `l[0]` and all subsequent elements in `l`, `i` is 1, and if the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` does not equal `gc`, then `a` has one additional element which is `a[1] + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
