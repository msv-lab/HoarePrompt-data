The code `l.append(abs(a[i + 1] - a[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 1, this means we're calculating `abs(a[2] - a[1])`. Since `n` is greater than 2, we can confirm that `a` has at least three elements (i.e., `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`). The values of `a[1]` and `a[2]` will directly impact the result of the absolute difference.

The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2. The other variables (`n` and the contents of `g`) do not change as a result of this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, and we append `abs(a[2] - a[1])` to the list `l`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, and we append `abs(a[2] - a[1])` to the list `l`.**
