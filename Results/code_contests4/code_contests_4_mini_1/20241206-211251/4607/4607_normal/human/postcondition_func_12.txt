The function accepts an integer `x`, a list of positive integers `y`, and a non-negative integer `p`. It computes `x` raised to the power of the integer represented by `y` modulo `p`. The function returns 1 if `y` is 0 (as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), or if `p` is 1 (since any number modulo 1 is 0). However, the function does not handle cases where `p` is 0, which would lead to an undefined operation in modular arithmetic. If `y` is not zero, the function performs exponentiation by squaring to efficiently compute the result.
