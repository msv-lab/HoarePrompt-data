d is a tuple containing three elements: N (the number of books on Desk A), M (the number of books on Desk B), and K (the maximum total reading time in minutes), where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. The next N elements represent A (a list of integers where each integer A_i denotes the time to read the i-th book on Desk A), and the following M elements represent B (a list of integers where each integer B_i denotes the time to read the i-th book on Desk B), where 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9.
