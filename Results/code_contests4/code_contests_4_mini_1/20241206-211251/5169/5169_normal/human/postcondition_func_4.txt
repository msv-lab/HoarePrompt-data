The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers (N, M, K) and returns an empty list if N is less than 2. If N is 2 or greater, it returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to N, including the number 2. The function does not consider the reading times from the two lists mentioned in the tuple; these are ignored in the computation of prime numbers.
