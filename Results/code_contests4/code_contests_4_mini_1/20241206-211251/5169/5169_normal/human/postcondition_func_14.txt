The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers that are derived from the output of `func_12()`, which is split into individual string elements and converted to integers. The actual contents of the returned list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_12()`, which is not provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific integers that may be returned by this function.
