The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, along with two lists `fact` and `ifact`, and returns the value of `t`, calculated as `(fact[n] * ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) modulo MOD`. The function assumes that `n` and `r` are within the bounds specified (1 <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= r <= n) and does not handle cases where `n` or `r` are out of these bounds. If the lists `fact` or `ifact` do not contain valid values for the indices being accessed, this may lead to an index error.
