N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000; K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= 10^9; A is a list of N integers representing the reading times for books on Desk A, where each A[i] (1 <= i <= N) is in the range 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9; B is a list of M integers representing the reading times for books on Desk B, where each B[i] (1 <= i <= M) is in the range 1 <= B[i] <= 10^9.
