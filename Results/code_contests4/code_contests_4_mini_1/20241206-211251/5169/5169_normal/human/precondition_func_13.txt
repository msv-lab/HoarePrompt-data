N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of N integers where each A[i] (1 <= i <= N) represents the time in minutes to read the i-th book on Desk A (1 <= A[i] <= 10^9), and B is a list of M integers where each B[j] (1 <= j <= M) represents the time in minutes to read the j-th book on Desk B (1 <= B[j] <= 10^9).
