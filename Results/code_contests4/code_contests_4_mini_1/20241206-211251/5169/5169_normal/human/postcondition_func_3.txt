The function accepts a tuple `Sum` containing three elements (N, M, K), where N and M are integers representing the number of books on desks A and B, and K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum time allowed. It calculates and returns an integer value `ans` based on the formula `ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2`, treating `Sum` as a numerical value. The function does not validate the contents of the tuple or handle any potential edge cases related to the nature or validity of the input values.
