a is a tuple containing three elements: N (an integer representing the number of books on Desk A), M (an integer representing the number of books on Desk B), and K (a non-negative integer representing the maximum total reading time allowed). Additionally, a contains two lists: the first list of N integers represents the reading times for the books on Desk A, and the second list of M integers represents the reading times for the books on Desk B. Each reading time is a positive integer.
