The value of `check` is assigned `False`. Since there are no conditions or calculations being performed that would affect the other variables or states, the output state reflects that no changes have been made to `N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `a`, `b`, or `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is greater than 0; the element at index `ptr1` in array `a` is less than the element at index `ptr2` in array `b`; the value of `totaltime` plus the element at index `ptr1` in array `a` is greater than `k`; `check` is False.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is greater than 0; the element at index `ptr1` in array `a` is less than the element at index `ptr2` in array `b`; the value of `totaltime` plus the element at index `ptr1` in array `a` is greater than `k`; `check` is False.**
