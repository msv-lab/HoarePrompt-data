The value of `check` is assigned False, which is already its initial state. Therefore, the output state indicates that there are no changes to the values of the other variables, and that `check` remains False.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of the selected values from `a` and `b`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, `check` is False, and `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is greater than `k`.**
