The value of `ptr1` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `totaltime`, `N`, `M`, and `ptr2` remain unchanged, and `count` is already increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `totaltime` is increased by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `N`, `M`, `ptr1` is now increased by 1, `ptr2` remains unchanged, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`totaltime` is increased by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `N`, `M`, `ptr1` is now increased by 1, `ptr2` remains unchanged, and `count` is increased by 1.**
