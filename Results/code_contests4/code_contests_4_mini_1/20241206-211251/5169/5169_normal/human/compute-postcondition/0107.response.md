To analyze the state of the variables after the while loop completes, we note the following:

- `ptr1` remains equal to the number of elements added from `a`, unchanged throughout the loop.
- `ptr2` will either be equal to `m` if all elements from `b` were added without exceeding `k`, or it will be less than `m` if the loop exited early due to exceeding `k`.
- `totaltime` will be the sum of the selected values from both `a` and `b` that were added without exceeding `k`. 
- `count` will indicate the total number of values added to `totaltime`, which will include the values added from both `a` and `b`.
- `check` will be True if the loop completed without exceeding `k`, otherwise it will be False if the loop exited early.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is equal to `m` if all elements from `b` were added without exceeding `k` or less than `m` if it exited early, `totaltime` is the sum of the selected values from `a` and `b` added without exceeding `k`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, `check` is True if the loop completed without exceeding `k`, otherwise False.**
