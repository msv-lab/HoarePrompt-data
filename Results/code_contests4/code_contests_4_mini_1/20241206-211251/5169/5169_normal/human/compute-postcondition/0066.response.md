The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `check` was `True`, so it is updated to `False`. The states of the other variables (`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `count`, and the conditions involving `n`, `m`, `k`, and the sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of selected values from `a` and `b` such that the total does not exceed `k`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, `check` is False, and the sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` is greater than `k`.**
