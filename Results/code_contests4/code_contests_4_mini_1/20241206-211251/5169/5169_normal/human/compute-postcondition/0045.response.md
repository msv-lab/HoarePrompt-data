The value of `ptr1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ptr1` is unknown, but this operation will affect its value. The variables `N`, `M`, `totaltime`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`; `count` is increased by 1; `ptr1` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`; `count` is increased by 1; `ptr1` is increased by 1.**
