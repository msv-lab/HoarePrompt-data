The variable `totaltime` is incremented by the value of `b[ptr2]`. The values of `N` and `M` are not directly affected, but the execution of this code implies that `ptr2` is within the bounds of `b`, meaning `ptr2` is less than `M`. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `totaltime` based on the current value of `b[ptr2]`.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `totaltime` is increased by the value of `b[ptr2]**.
