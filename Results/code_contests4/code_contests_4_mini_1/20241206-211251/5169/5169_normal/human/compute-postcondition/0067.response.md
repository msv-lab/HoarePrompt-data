The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of selected values from `a` and `b` such that the total does not exceed `k`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, `check` is False, and the sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` is greater than `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
