Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than or equal to `m`, and `totaltime` is the sum of selected values from `a` and `b` such that the total does not exceed `k`. If the sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr1` is increased by 1, `count` is increased by 1, and `check` remains True. Otherwise, `check` is set to False, and the sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` is greater than `k`, causing a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
