Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is greater than 0; if the sum of `totaltime` and the element at index `ptr1` in array `a` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the sum of `totaltime` and the element at index `ptr1` in array `a` is greater than `k`, `check` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
