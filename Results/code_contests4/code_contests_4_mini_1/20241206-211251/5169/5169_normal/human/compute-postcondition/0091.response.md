The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of the selected values from `a` and `b`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, `check` is False, and `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is greater than `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
