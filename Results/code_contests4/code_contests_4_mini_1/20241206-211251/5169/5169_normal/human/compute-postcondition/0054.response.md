Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000. If `totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k`, then `totaltime` is increased by the value of `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `check` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
