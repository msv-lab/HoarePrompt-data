The value of `ptr2` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `ptr2` is less than `m`, so after execution, `ptr2` will still be less than `m`. The values of `ptr1`, `totaltime`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is now one more than before but still less than `m`, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is now one more than before but still less than `m`, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
