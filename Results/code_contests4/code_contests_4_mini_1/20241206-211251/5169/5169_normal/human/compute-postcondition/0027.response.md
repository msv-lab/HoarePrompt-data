Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; if `a[ptr1] < b[ptr2]`, then if the sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, `ptr1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `check` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If `a[ptr1]` is not less than `b[ptr2]`, then if the sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr2` is increased by 1; otherwise, `check` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop.***
