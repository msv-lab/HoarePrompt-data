The function `func_22` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it processes two lists, `A` and `B`, which represent the reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B respectively. The function evaluates the reading times based on the constraints of `N`, `M`, and `K`. 

The function returns a result based on the comparison of the total reading times from lists `A` and `B` relative to `K`. The specific output or results are not detailed in the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_22` is to process two lists of reading times for books and return a value based on their comparison to a given threshold `K`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the evaluation of reading times from two lists relative to a threshold K.**
