According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ptr1` and its comparison with `n`. If `ptr1` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ptr1` is less than `n`. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `ptr1` since it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than or equal to `m`, and `totaltime` is the sum of selected values from `a` and `b` such that the total does not exceed `k`.**
