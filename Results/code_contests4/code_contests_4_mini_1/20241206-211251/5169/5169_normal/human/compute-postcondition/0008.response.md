According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ptr1`, `n`, `ptr2`, and `m`. The loop will execute if both `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `ptr1` is 0, which is less than `n` (since `N` is at least 1, `n` must be at least 1).
- `ptr2` is 0, which is less than `m` (since `M` is at least 1, `m` must be at least 1).
- `n` and `m` are assigned values returned by `func_14()`, but we do not have their exact values.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that both `n` and `m` are greater than 0. Since `ptr1` and `ptr2` are initially 0, they will not prevent the loop from executing.

Therefore, no modifications to `ptr1` or `ptr2` are necessary. However, we need to verify that `n` and `m` are both at least 1.

State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is greater than 0.**
