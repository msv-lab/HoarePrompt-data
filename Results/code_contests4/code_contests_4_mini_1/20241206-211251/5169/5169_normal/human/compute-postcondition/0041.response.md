Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000. If `a[ptr1] < b[ptr2]` and if `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, `ptr1` is increased by 1, `ptr2` remains unchanged, and `count` is increased by 1. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` exceeds `k`, `check` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If `a[ptr1]` is not less than `b[ptr2]` and if `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr2` is increased by 1. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` exceeds `k`, `check` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop.***
