The function `func_14()` is called, which is expected to return three values assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, the specific output of `func_14()` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of the other variables (A and B) remains unchanged as they are not affected by this line.

Since we do not have the values from `func_14()`, we can only state that `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values returned by the function.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000; `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `B` is a list of `M` integers; `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_14()`.**
