Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `check` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
