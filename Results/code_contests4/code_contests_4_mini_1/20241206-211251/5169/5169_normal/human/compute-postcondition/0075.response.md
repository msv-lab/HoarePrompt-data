Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than or equal to `m`, and `totaltime` is the sum of selected values from `a` and `b` such that the total does not exceed `k`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr1` is increased by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]` (ensuring it does not exceed `k`), and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `check` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
