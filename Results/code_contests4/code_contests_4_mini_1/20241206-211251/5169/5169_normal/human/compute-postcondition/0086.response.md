Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated to `totaltime + b[ptr2]`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, `check` is True if the loop completed without exceeding `k`, otherwise check is False if the loop exited early due to exceeding `k`, and the sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
