Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr2` is increased by 1, `totaltime` is updated to `totaltime + b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `check` is True if the loop completed without exceeding `k`. Otherwise, if `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is greater than `k`, `ptr2` remains less than `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of the selected values from `a` and `b`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, and `check` is False, indicating that the loop exited early due to exceeding `k`.***
