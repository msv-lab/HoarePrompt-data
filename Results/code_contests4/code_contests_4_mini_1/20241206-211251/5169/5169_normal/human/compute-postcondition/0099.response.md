Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr2` is increased by 1 (still less than `m`), `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ptr1` remains equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `check` is `False`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
