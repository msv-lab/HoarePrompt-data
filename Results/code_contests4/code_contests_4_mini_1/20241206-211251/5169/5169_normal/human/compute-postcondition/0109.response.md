Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than or equal to `n`, `ptr2` is less than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of selected values from `a` and `b` such that the total does not exceed `k`, and `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`. If `check` is False, `count` is printed. If `check` is True, `ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is equal to `m` if all elements from `b` were added without exceeding `k`, otherwise less than `m` if it exited early, `totaltime` remains the sum of the selected values from `a` and `b`, `count` is printed, and `check` indicates whether the loop completed successfully without exceeding `k`.***
