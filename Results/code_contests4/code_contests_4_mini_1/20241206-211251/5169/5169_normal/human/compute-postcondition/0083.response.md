Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a` such that their sum `totaltime` does not exceed `k`, `ptr2` is less than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of the selected values from `a` and `b` that were added without exceeding `k`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, and `check` is True if the loop completed without exceeding `k`, otherwise check is False if the loop exited early due to exceeding `k`.**
