The variable `totaltime` is incremented by the value of `b[ptr2]`. The initial state indicates that `ptr2` is less than `m`, but we do not know the specific values of `totaltime`, `b`, or `ptr2`. Therefore, the state of `totaltime` will change, but we cannot determine its exact value after the operation without knowing `b[ptr2]`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]**.
