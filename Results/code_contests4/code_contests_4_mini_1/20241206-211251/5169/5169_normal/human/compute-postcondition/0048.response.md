Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, `check` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
