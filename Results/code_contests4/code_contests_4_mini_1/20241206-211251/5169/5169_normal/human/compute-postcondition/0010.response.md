Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is greater than 0; the element at index `ptr1` in array `a` is less than the element at index `ptr2` in array `b`; and the sum of `totaltime` and the element at index `ptr1` in array `a` is less than or equal to `k`.***
