Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of the selected values from `a` and `b`, `count` is the total number of values added to `totaltime`, `check` is False (indicating that the loop exited early due to exceeding `k`), and `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is greater than `k`.***
