The `check` variable is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect any other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is `False`. 

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is `False`**.
