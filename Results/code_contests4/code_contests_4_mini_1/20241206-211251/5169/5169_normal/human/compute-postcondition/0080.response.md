The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not change the values of `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, or any other variables. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `check` is now `False`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is the sum of selected values from `a` and `b` such that the total does not exceed `k`, and for the loop to execute again, `totaltime + a[ptr1]` must be less than or equal to `k`; `check` is False**.
