According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ptr2` and its relationship to `m`. The loop will continue executing as long as `ptr2` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `ptr2` is less than `m`, which means the loop can execute again. No adjustments are necessary for `ptr2` since it already satisfies the loop condition. 

State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`**
