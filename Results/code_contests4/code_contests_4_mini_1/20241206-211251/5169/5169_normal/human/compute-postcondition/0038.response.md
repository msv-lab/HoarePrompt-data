The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `N` and `M` remain unchanged, and the conditions for the loop to execute again are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `check` is False.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers such that 1 <= `N`, `M` <= 200000; `check` is False**
