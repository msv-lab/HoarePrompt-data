In the provided code snippet, the variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state indicates that `ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, and `ptr2` is less than `m`. There are no changes to `ptr1` or `ptr2`, as only `check` is affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `ptr1` and `ptr2`, along with the new value of `check`.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to the number of elements added from `a`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `check` is False**
