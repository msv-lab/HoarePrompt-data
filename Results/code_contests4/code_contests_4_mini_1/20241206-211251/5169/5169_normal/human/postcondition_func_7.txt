The function accepts a tuple `d`, a search value `x`, and a default value `default`. It returns two instances of `default` if `x` is not found in `d`. If `x` is found, it returns the indices of the first and last occurrences of `x` in `d`. If `d` is empty, it will also return `default` for both indices.
