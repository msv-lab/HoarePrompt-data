The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a list of integers `primes`, and returns the total number of divisors of `n` based on its prime factorization. If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 1, as 1 has exactly one divisor, which is itself. If `n` is 0, the function does not explicitly handle this case, but it will not return a meaningful divisor count since 0 has an infinite number of divisors. The function calculates the number of divisors by iterating over the list `primes` and counting how many times each prime divides `n`. The final result is the product of these counts plus one for the power of each prime in the factorization.
