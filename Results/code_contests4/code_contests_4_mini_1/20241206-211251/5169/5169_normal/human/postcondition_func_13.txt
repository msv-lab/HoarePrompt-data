The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers derived from the output of the function `func_12()`, which is assumed to be a string that can be converted to integers. The actual values depend on the output of `func_12()`, and there are no checks for the format of that output, meaning if `func_12()` returns a non-numeric string, it could lead to errors when converting to integers.
