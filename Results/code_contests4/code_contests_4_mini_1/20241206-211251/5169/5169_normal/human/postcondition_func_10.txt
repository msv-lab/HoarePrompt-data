The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` (the number of books on Desk A) and `k` (the maximum allowed reading time in minutes), and returns the total number of complete reading time slots required to read all books on Desk A. It calculates this by performing integer division of `n` by `k` and adds one if there is any remaining reading time after dividing, indicating that additional time is needed for the last incomplete slot. If `k` is zero, this function may lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code.
