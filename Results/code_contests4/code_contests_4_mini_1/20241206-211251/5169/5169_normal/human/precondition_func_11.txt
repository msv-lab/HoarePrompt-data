N and M are integers representing the number of books on desks A and B respectively, where 1 <= N, M <= 200000; K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum time allowed, where 1 <= K <= 10^9; A and B are lists of integers where A[i] and B[i] (1 <= i <= N, M) represent the time in minutes to read each book, and each value satisfies 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^9.
