N and M are integers representing the number of books on desks A and B respectively, such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000; K is a non-negative integer representing the total time limit, where 1 <= K <= 10^9; A and B are lists of integers representing the time in minutes to read each book on desks A and B respectively, where each A_i and B_i satisfies 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9.
