The function accepts no parameters and processes two lists of integers representing reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B. It calculates the total reading time from both lists while ensuring that the total does not exceed a given threshold `K`. It counts how many books can be read without exceeding this limit and prints this count. If not all books can be read without exceeding `K`, it will print the count before attempting to read the remaining books from Desk A and then Desk B if possible. The function does not return any value; it only prints the count of books read.
