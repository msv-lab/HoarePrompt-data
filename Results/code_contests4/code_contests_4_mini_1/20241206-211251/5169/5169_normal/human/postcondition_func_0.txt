The function accepts an integer `mod` and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorial values from 0! to 200004!, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of the factorial values modulo `mod` for all integers from 0 to 200004. The function handles the calculation of both factorials and their inverses correctly, but it assumes that `mod` is a prime number to utilize Fermat's Little Theorem for calculating the inverses. If `mod` is not prime, the inverses may not be valid.
