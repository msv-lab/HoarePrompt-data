You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.

It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).

Consider the following action:

* Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.



How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
B_1 B_2 \ldots B_M


Output

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are integers representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B respectively, where 1 <= N, M <= 200000; K is a positive integer representing the maximum total reading time allowed, where 1 <= K <= 10^9; A_i are integers representing the reading time for each book on Desk A, and B_i are integers representing the reading time for each book on Desk B, where 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9 for all valid i.

    ifact = [0] * 200005
    ifact[200004] = pow(fact[200004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(200004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing values of factorials from 0! to 200004!, `i` is 0, `ifact` is a list where `ifact[k]` for `k` in range from 0 to 200004 is the modular inverse of `k!` modulo `mod`.
    return fact, ifact
    #The program returns the list 'fact' containing values of factorials from 0! to 200004! and the list 'ifact' where 'ifact[k]' is the modular inverse of 'k!' modulo 'mod' for 'k' in the range from 0 to 200004.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `mod` and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorial values from 0! to 200004!, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of the factorial values modulo `mod` for all integers from 0 to 200004. The function handles the calculation of both factorials and their inverses correctly, but it assumes that `mod` is a prime number to utilize Fermat's Little Theorem for calculating the inverses. If `mod` is not prime, the inverses may not be valid.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple containing three integers N, M, and K where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9; p is a tuple of two lists containing integers A and B, where A has N integers such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N, and B has M integers such that 1 <= B[j] <= 10^9 for 1 <= j <= M.
def func_2(n, p):
    """ returns N inverse modulo p """
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns N inverse modulo p, where N is the first integer in the tuple n and p is represented by the tuple containing the two lists A and B.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers and a tuple `p` containing two lists of integers. It returns the modular inverse of the first integer in `n` (denoted as N) with respect to the second integer in `p` (which is implicitly derived from the lists A and B in `p`). The function does not explicitly handle cases where the modular inverse does not exist, such as when N and p are not coprime.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= r <= n; fact is a list of integers of length n+1, and ifact is a list of integers of length n+1, where each integer is less than or equal to 10^9.
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    """ takes 4 arguments: n , r and factorial and inverse factorial lists"""
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % MOD % MOD
    return t
    #The program returns the value of t, which is calculated as fact[n] multiplied by ifact[r] and ifact[n - r], then taken modulo MOD, taken modulo MOD again.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, along with two lists `fact` and `ifact`, and returns the value of `t`, calculated as `(fact[n] * ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) modulo MOD`. The function assumes that `n` and `r` are within the bounds specified (1 <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= r <= n) and does not handle cases where `n` or `r` are out of these bounds. If the lists `fact` or `ifact` do not contain valid values for the indices being accessed, this may lead to an index error.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Sum is a tuple containing three elements: N and M are integers representing the number of books on desks A and B respectively (1 <= N, M <= 200000), and K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum time in minutes allowed (1 <= K <= 10^9). Additionally, A and B are lists of integers representing the time in minutes to read each book on desks A and B respectively (1 <= A[i], B[j] <= 10^9 for all valid indices i and j).
def func_4(Sum):
    """this function returns the maximum n for which Summation(n) <= Sum"""
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2
    return ans
    #The program returns the calculated value of ans based on the formula ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2, where Sum is treated as a numerical value from the tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `Sum` containing three elements (N, M, K), where N and M are integers representing the number of books on desks A and B, and K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum time allowed. It calculates and returns an integer value `ans` based on the formula `ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2`, treating `Sum` as a numerical value. The function does not validate the contents of the tuple or handle any potential edge cases related to the nature or validity of the input values.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple containing three elements: an integer N (number of books on Desk A), an integer M (number of books on Desk B), and an integer K (maximum minutes allowed), followed by two lists of integers representing the reading times for the books on Desk A and Desk B, respectively, with lengths N and M.
def func_5(n):

    if (n < 2) :
        return list()
        #The program returns an empty list
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a tuple containing three elements: an integer N (number of books on Desk A), an integer M (number of books on Desk B), and an integer K (maximum minutes allowed), followed by two lists of integers representing the reading times for the books on Desk A and Desk B, respectively, with lengths N and M; and N is greater than or equal to 2.
    prime = [(True) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    return r
    #The program returns all odd prime numbers p such that p is less than or equal to N, where N is an element of the tuple n and N is greater than or equal to 9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers (N, M, K) and returns an empty list if N is less than 2. If N is 2 or greater, it returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to N, including the number 2. The function does not consider the reading times from the two lists mentioned in the tuple; these are ignored in the computation of prime numbers.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of books on two desks, and start is a positive integer that defaults to 1.
def func_6(n, start):
    """ returns a list of all divisors till n """
    divisors = []
    for i in range(start, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n / i == i:

            else:
                divisors.extend([i, n // i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n`, `n` is a positive integer.
    return divisors
    #The program returns all unique divisors of the positive integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and an optional positive integer `start`, and it returns a list of all unique divisors of `n` starting from the `start` value up to the square root of `n`. If the `start` parameter is greater than the square root of `n`, the function will return an empty list, which is a potential edge case not covered in the annotations.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B combined, primes is a list of integers where the first N integers represent the time to read each book from Desk A and the next M integers represent the time to read each book from Desk B. The total time to read books must not exceed K, which is a positive integer.

    """ returns the number of divisors, two arguments n and the sieve till n """
    divs_number = 1

            return divs_number
        
        t = 1
        
        while n % i == 0:
            t += 1
            n //= i
        
        divs_number *= t
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divs_number` is the total number of divisors of the original `n`, `n` is either 1 or 0, `primes` is a list of integers processed, and `K` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a list of integers `primes`, and returns the total number of divisors of `n` based on its prime factorization. If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 1, as 1 has exactly one divisor, which is itself. If `n` is 0, the function does not explicitly handle this case, but it will not return a meaningful divisor count since 0 has an infinite number of divisors. The function calculates the number of divisors by iterating over the list `primes` and counting how many times each prime divides `n`. The final result is the product of these counts plus one for the power of each prime in the factorization.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a tuple containing three elements: N (the number of books on Desk A), M (the number of books on Desk B), and K (the maximum total reading time in minutes), where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. The next N elements represent A (a list of integers where each integer A_i denotes the time to read the i-th book on Desk A), and the following M elements represent B (a list of integers where each integer B_i denotes the time to read the i-th book on Desk B), where 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9.
def func_8(d, x, default):

    if (left == -1) :
        return default, default
        #The program returns two instances of the variable 'default'
    else :
        return left, right
        #The program returns the indices 'left' and 'right', where 'left' is the index of the first occurrence of 'x' in tuple 'd' and 'right' is the index of the last occurrence of 'x' in tuple 'd', confirming that 'x' is found in 'd'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `d`, a search value `x`, and a default value `default`. It returns two instances of `default` if `x` is not found in `d`. If `x` is found, it returns the indices of the first and last occurrences of `x` in `d`. If `d` is empty, it will also return `default` for both indices.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple containing three integers N, M, and K, where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9; y is a tuple containing two lists of integers A and B, where A has N integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^9) and B has M integers (1 <= B[i] <= 10^9).

    return x
    #The program returns the last non-empty tuple 'x' derived from the elements in 'y', which is empty, meaning 'x' is likely None or an empty tuple
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `x`, which is expected to contain three integers, and a tuple `y`, which is expected to contain two lists of integers. However, the function does not utilize the contents of `x` or `y` correctly; instead, it treats `x` as a number and attempts to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function will return the last non-empty value of `x` based on the GCD calculation, which is not aligned with the expected input types and usage. If `y` is empty, `x` will be returned as it is, which could be an integer or a tuple, but this behavior does not match the provided annotations.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a tuple containing three elements: N (an integer representing the number of books on Desk A), M (an integer representing the number of books on Desk B), and K (a non-negative integer representing the maximum total reading time allowed). Additionally, a contains two lists: the first list of N integers represents the reading times for the books on Desk A, and the second list of M integers represents the reading times for the books on Desk B. Each reading time is a positive integer.

    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the tuple 'a' are in non-decreasing order and no element comparison has failed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `a` and checks if the reading times (the last two elements) are in non-decreasing order, returning `True` if they are and `False` if any reading time exceeds the following one. It does not validate the number of books or consider the maximum reading time allowed.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of books on Desk A, k is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowed reading time in minutes, and the lists of reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B are provided as input, with each reading time being a positive integer.
def func_11(n, k):

    #The program returns the number of complete time slots of reading books on Desk A given by n // k, plus 1 if there is a remainder when n is divided by k, indicating that there is additional reading time required.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` (the number of books on Desk A) and `k` (the maximum allowed reading time in minutes), and returns the total number of complete reading time slots required to read all books on Desk A. It calculates this by performing integer division of `n` by `k` and adds one if there is any remaining reading time after dividing, indicating that additional time is needed for the last incomplete slot. If `k` is zero, this function may lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code.

    #The program returns a line from standard input, which is a string that has been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. It does not handle any specific edge cases related to the input values or formats; it simply reads a line from input.

#Function 13:

    #The program returns a list of integers resulting from the function 'func_12()', which is converted from a string output to integers using the map function. The specific values depend on the output of 'func_12()'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers derived from the output of the function `func_12()`, which is assumed to be a string that can be converted to integers. The actual values depend on the output of `func_12()`, and there are no checks for the format of that output, meaning if `func_12()` returns a non-numeric string, it could lead to errors when converting to integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers that are derived from the output of `func_12()`, which is split into individual string elements and converted to integers. The actual contents of the returned list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_12()`, which is not provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific integers that may be returned by this function.

#Function 16:

However, it is important to note that the function assumes `func_9(a, b)` does not return zero, as this would lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code.

#Function 18:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes two lists of integers representing reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B. It calculates the total reading time from both lists while ensuring that the total does not exceed a given threshold `K`. It counts how many books can be read without exceeding this limit and prints this count. If not all books can be read without exceeding `K`, it will print the count before attempting to read the remaining books from Desk A and then Desk B if possible. The function does not return any value; it only prints the count of books read.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
