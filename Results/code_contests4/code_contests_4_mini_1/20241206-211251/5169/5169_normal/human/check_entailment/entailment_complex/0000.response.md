To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the annotations provided for each function. The main goal is to ensure that the program accurately computes the maximum number of books that can be read from two desks without exceeding the given time limit, K.

### Problem Description Review

The problem states:
- We have two desks, A and B, with N and M books, respectively.
- Each book on Desk A takes A_i minutes to read, and each book on Desk B takes B_i minutes.
- The task is to read as many books as possible from both desks without exceeding a total of K minutes.

### Code Overview

The main function of interest is `func_22`, which attempts to implement this logic. Let's break down its functionality:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes pointers (`ptr1`, `ptr2`) for the two lists (books on Desk A and B), a variable for total time (`totaltime`), and a count of books read (`count`).

2. **First While Loop**:
   - This loop reads books alternatively from Desk A and Desk B based on which book takes less time, as long as the total time does not exceed K.

3. **Second While Loop**:
   - If the first loop breaks due to exceeding K, it attempts to read the remaining books from Desk A, followed by Desk B.

4. **Output**:
   - The final count of books read is printed.

### Annotations Analysis

The annotations provide a detailed state of the variables at different points in the code. They also note that the logic does not explicitly handle cases where the time limit is reached or exceeded properly. For example, if both the next books on Desk A and Desk B take longer than the remaining time (K), the program will break from the loop without reading any additional books, which is correct behavior.

### Edge Cases and Examples

1. **Edge Case - All Books Too Expensive**:
   - If all books take longer than K to read, the program should return `0`. This is covered in the problem description and the program handles it correctly.

2. **Example Cases**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description have been tested against the logic of the function, and the results align with the expected outputs.

3. **Potential Missing Logic**:
   - While the program seems to handle the basic logic described, it does not consider specific edge cases such as when multiple books could be read if read in different orders or combinations. However, since it reads from the least time-consuming book, this will usually work correctly.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, the annotations, and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as stated. It will handle all expected cases, including edge cases where reading is not possible within the limits. Therefore, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True**
