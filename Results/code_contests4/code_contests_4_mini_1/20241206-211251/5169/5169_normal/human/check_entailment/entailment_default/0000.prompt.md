You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.

It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).

Consider the following action:

* Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.



How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
B_1 B_2 \ldots B_M


Output

Print an integer representing the maximum number of books that can be read.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(mod=mod):

    for i in range(200004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
    return (fact, ifact)
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts an integer `mod` and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorial values from 0! to 200004!, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of the factorial values modulo `mod` for all integers from 0 to 200004. The function handles the calculation of both factorials and their inverses correctly, but it assumes that `mod` is a prime number to utilize Fermat's Little Theorem for calculating the inverses. If `mod` is not prime, the inverses may not be valid.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, p):
    """ returns N inverse modulo p """
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers and a tuple `p` containing two lists of integers. It returns the modular inverse of the first integer in `n` (denoted as N) with respect to the second integer in `p` (which is implicitly derived from the lists A and B in `p`). The function does not explicitly handle cases where the modular inverse does not exist, such as when N and p are not coprime.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    """ takes 4 arguments: n , r and factorial and inverse factorial lists"""
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % MOD % MOD
    return t
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, along with two lists `fact` and `ifact`, and returns the value of `t`, calculated as `(fact[n] * ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) modulo MOD`. The function assumes that `n` and `r` are within the bounds specified (1 <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= r <= n) and does not handle cases where `n` or `r` are out of these bounds. If the lists `fact` or `ifact` do not contain valid values for the indices being accessed, this may lead to an index error.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(Sum):
    """this function returns the maximum n for which Summation(n) <= Sum"""
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2
    return ans
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts a tuple `Sum` containing three elements (N, M, K), where N and M are integers representing the number of books on desks A and B, and K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum time allowed. It calculates and returns an integer value `ans` based on the formula `ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2`, treating `Sum` as a numerical value. The function does not validate the contents of the tuple or handle any potential edge cases related to the nature or validity of the input values.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(n):
    """ returns a list of prime numbers till n """
    if n < 2:
        return list()
    prime = [True for _ in range(n + 1)]

    r = [2]
    for p in range(3, n + 1, 2):
        if prime[p]:
            r.append(p)
    return r
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers (N, M, K) and returns an empty list if N is less than 2. If N is 2 or greater, it returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to N, including the number 2. The function does not consider the reading times from the two lists mentioned in the tuple; these are ignored in the computation of prime numbers.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(n, start=1):
    """ returns a list of all divisors till n """
    divisors = []
    for i in range(start, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):

                divisors.append(i)
            else:
                divisors.extend([i, n // i])
    return divisors
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and an optional positive integer `start`, and it returns a list of all unique divisors of `n` starting from the `start` value up to the square root of `n`. If the `start` parameter is greater than the square root of `n`, the function will return an empty list, which is a potential edge case not covered in the annotations.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n, primes):
    """ returns the number of divisors, two arguments n and the sieve till n """
    divs_number = 1
    for i in primes:

        while n % i == 0:
            t += 1
            n //= i
        divs_number *= t
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a list of integers `primes`, and returns the total number of divisors of `n` based on its prime factorization. If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 1, as 1 has exactly one divisor, which is itself. If `n` is 0, the function does not explicitly handle this case, but it will not return a meaningful divisor count since 0 has an infinite number of divisors. The function calculates the number of divisors by iterating over the list `primes` and counting how many times each prime divides `n`. The final result is the product of these counts plus one for the power of each prime in the factorization.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(d, x, default=-1):
    """ Takes 2 arguments an iterable and an element. returns a tuple (firstoccurence,lastoccurence) -1 if not found """

    if left == -1:
        return (default, default)
    else:
        return (left, right)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a tuple `d`, a search value `x`, and a default value `default`. It returns two instances of `default` if `x` is not found in `d`. If `x` is found, it returns the indices of the first and last occurrences of `x` in `d`. If `d` is empty, it will also return `default` for both indices.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    """ returns greatest common divisor of x and y """
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts a tuple `x`, which is expected to contain three integers, and a tuple `y`, which is expected to contain two lists of integers. However, the function does not utilize the contents of `x` or `y` correctly; instead, it treats `x` as a number and attempts to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function will return the last non-empty value of `x` based on the GCD calculation, which is not aligned with the expected input types and usage. If `y` is empty, `x` will be returned as it is, which could be an integer or a tuple, but this behavior does not match the provided annotations.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a):
    """ returns True/False """
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a tuple `a` and checks if the reading times (the last two elements) are in non-decreasing order, returning `True` if they are and `False` if any reading time exceeds the following one. It does not validate the number of books or consider the maximum reading time allowed.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n, k=1):
    return n // k + (n % k != 0)
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` (the number of books on Desk A) and `k` (the maximum allowed reading time in minutes), and returns the total number of complete reading time slots required to read all books on Desk A. It calculates this by performing integer division of `n` by `k` and adds one if there is any remaining reading time after dividing, indicating that additional time is needed for the last incomplete slot. If `k` is zero, this function may lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a string from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. It does not handle any specific edge cases related to the input values or formats; it simply reads a line from input.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    return int(func_12())
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the integer result of the function `func_12()`, which relies on the external variables N, M, K, A, and B. It is important to note that the actual behavior of `func_12()` is not defined in the provided code, and any potential edge cases or errors that might arise within `func_12()` are not addressed in this function.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    return map(int, func_12().split())
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers derived from the output of the function `func_12()`, which is assumed to be a string that can be converted to integers. The actual values depend on the output of `func_12()`, and there are no checks for the format of that output, meaning if `func_12()` returns a non-numeric string, it could lead to errors when converting to integers.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    return list(map(int, func_12().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers that are derived from the output of `func_12()`, which is split into individual string elements and converted to integers. The actual contents of the returned list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_12()`, which is not provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific integers that may be returned by this function.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    return func_12().split()
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts no parameters and returns the output of the function `func_12()` split into a list of strings. There are no checks or validations for the output of `func_12()`, and it assumes that `func_12()` will return a string that can be split; if `func_12()` returns an empty string or a non-string type, the behavior is not defined in this function.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // func_9(a, b)
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the absolute value of the element-wise product of the two lists divided by the result of `func_9` applied to those lists. However, it is important to note that the function assumes `func_9(a, b)` does not return zero, as this would lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18(a, sep=' ', end='\n'):
    print(sep.join(map(str, a)), end=end)
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function accepts a string `a`, a separator `sep`, and an end string `end`, and prints the contents of `a` formatted as a string with `sep` as the separator between elements. The function does not return any value; it only handles output.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    return defaultdict(int)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a defaultdict of integers, which is a dictionary that provides default values of 0 for any key that does not exist. It does not perform any calculations or operations involving the variables N, M, K, A, and B mentioned in the comments, as they are not utilized within the function.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_20():
    return defaultdict(list)
''' 

 Output decription for function20:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns an empty defaultdict of lists, which can be used to store values indexed by keys. However, since it returns an empty structure, it does not perform any operations or provide any specific values or keys.
Function number 21 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_21(s):
    return sys.stdout.write(s)
''' 

 Output decription for function21:  The function accepts a string `s`, which contains formatted input including integers N, M, K and lists of reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B. It returns the same string `s` by writing it to standard output without modifications.
Function number 22 :

 Output decription for function22:  The function accepts no parameters and processes two lists of integers representing reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B. It calculates the total reading time from both lists while ensuring that the total does not exceed a given threshold `K`. It counts how many books can be read without exceeding this limit and prints this count. If not all books can be read without exceeding `K`, it will print the count before attempting to read the remaining books from Desk A and then Desk B if possible. The function does not return any value; it only prints the count of books read.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
