The provided program is intended to read books from two desks (A and B) while keeping track of the total reading time, ensuring it does not exceed a specified limit (K). The goal is to maximize the number of books read within this time constraint.

To assess the correctness, let's analyze the key components of the program, specifically in `func_22`, which implements the main logic intended to solve the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of books (N and M), the maximum reading time (K), and the individual reading times for each book on both desks A and B.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes pointers (`ptr1` and `ptr2`) to track the current book being read from each desk, a variable (`totaltime`) to accumulate the total reading time, and a counter (`count`) to count the number of books read.

3. **Main Loop**: The main while loop iteratively reads the books, comparing the reading times of the top books from both desks and choosing the one with the lesser reading time, provided that adding this book does not exceed the maximum allowed time (K):
   - If a book can be read without exceeding K, it is added to the `totaltime`, and the count is incremented.
   - If reading the next book would exceed K, the loop breaks and the current count of books read is printed.

4. **Remaining Books**: After the first loop, if K has not been exceeded, the function attempts to read any remaining books from Desk A, followed by Desk B, again checking that the total time does not exceed K.

5. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the total count of books read.

### Conclusion on Correctness

The algorithm correctly implements the logic required to maximize the number of books read while adhering to the time constraint. The approach is greedy â€” always selecting the book with the lesser reading time from the two available desks, ensuring that it respects the time constraint K.

### Edge Cases Covered
- When the total reading time of all books exceeds K, it correctly counts only those that can be read within the limit.
- If all books can be read within K, it sums them all.
- It handles the scenario where no books can be read if all individual reading times exceed K.

### Final Verdict
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of books that can be read given the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
