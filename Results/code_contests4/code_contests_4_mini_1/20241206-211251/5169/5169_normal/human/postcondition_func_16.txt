The function accepts two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the absolute value of the element-wise product of the two lists divided by the result of `func_9` applied to those lists. However, it is important to note that the function assumes `func_9(a, b)` does not return zero, as this would lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code.
