The function accepts a tuple `n` containing three integers and a tuple `p` containing two lists of integers. It returns the modular inverse of the first integer in `n` (denoted as N) with respect to the second integer in `p` (which is implicitly derived from the lists A and B in `p`). The function does not explicitly handle cases where the modular inverse does not exist, such as when N and p are not coprime.
