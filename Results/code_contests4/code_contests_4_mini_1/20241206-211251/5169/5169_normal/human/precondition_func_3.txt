Sum is a tuple containing three elements: N and M are integers representing the number of books on desks A and B respectively (1 <= N, M <= 200000), and K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum time in minutes allowed (1 <= K <= 10^9). Additionally, A and B are lists of integers representing the time in minutes to read each book on desks A and B respectively (1 <= A[i], B[j] <= 10^9 for all valid indices i and j).
