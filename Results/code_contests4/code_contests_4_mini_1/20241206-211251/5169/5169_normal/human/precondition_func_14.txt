N and M are integers representing the number of books on desks A and B respectively, both in the range 1 to 200000; K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum total reading time, with a value up to 10^9; A is a list of N positive integers where each integer A_i (1 <= i <= N) represents the reading time for the i-th book on desk A (1 <= A_i <= 10^9); B is a list of M positive integers where each integer B_i (1 <= i <= M) represents the reading time for the i-th book on desk B (1 <= B_i <= 10^9).
