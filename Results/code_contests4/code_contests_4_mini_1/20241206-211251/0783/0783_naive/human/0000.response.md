To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code thoroughly.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have a chessboard of size `n x m`.
2. There are specific movements allowed defined by `a` and `b`.
3. We need to find out the minimum number of moves required to move the candy to one of the corners of the chessboard or determine if it's impossible.

### Program Overview:
The program reads the dimensions of the chessboard and the starting position, along with the movement parameters. It then checks each corner of the board to see if the candy can reach there using the specified moves.

### Key Logic in the Program:
- It calculates the distance to each corner using `dx` and `dy`.
- It checks whether the distance is divisible by `a` and `b` respectively and if the parity (even or odd) of the number of moves in each direction matches.
- It updates the minimum number of moves required to reach any of the corners if the conditions are met.
- Finally, it checks if the maximum allowable moves left in the board are less than `a` or `b`, which indicates that it's impossible to make further moves.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program uses integer division (`/`) which in Python 2 (as indicated by `raw_input()`) would result in a float. This could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly. In Python 3, this should be `//` for integer division.
2. The condition where it checks if the positions are reachable does not account for the scenario where the starting position is already at a corner.
3. The logic that determines if it's impossible (the `v` variable) might not cover all edge cases, especially how it handles cases where moves are possible but may not lead to a corner effectively.

### Example Cases:
1. If we take the input `5 5 1 1 1 1`, the expected output should be `0` since (1,1) is already a corner. The program currently would incorrectly return "Poor Inna and pony!" because it does not check for this case initially.
2. The program should also correctly handle cases where the movements would allow reaching a corner but the conditions of distance and parity aren't satisfied.

Given these observations, there are cases where the program does not produce the correct output based on the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the scenario where the starting position is already at a corner and does not ensure that integer division is used correctly to avoid unintended float results.
