To determine the correctness of the provided annotated program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and see if it adheres to the requirements of the task.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Parameters:** 
   - The program accepts six integers: `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`.
   - These represent the dimensions of the chessboard, the initial position of the candy, and the movement increments in the x and y directions, respectively.

2. **Movement Rules:**
   - The candy can be moved in four possible directions based on the values of `a` and `b`.
   - The goal is to move the candy to one of the four corners of the chessboard, which are `(1, 1)`, `(1, m)`, `(n, 1)`, `(n, m)`.

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - The program must output the minimum number of moves required to reach a corner or indicate if it's impossible with the message "Poor Inna and pony!".

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Variable Setup:** 
   - The program initializes a variable `v` to a very high value, which will eventually hold the minimum number of moves necessary to reach any corner.

2. **Looping Through Corners:**
   - The program iterates through each corner and calculates `dx` and `dy`, which are the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates between the current position and the corner.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - It checks if the candy can be moved to the corner based on the movement rules:
     - If both `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the number of moves required in both directions (after division) has the same parity (both even or both odd), then the move is possible.
     - If a direct move to a corner is possible (i.e., `dx` and `dy` are both 0), it directly sets `v` to 0.

4. **Final Moves Calculation:**
   - After checking all corners, if `v` remains unchanged from its initial value, it indicates that no valid moves were found.
   - The program also checks if the current position is such that moving the candy is impossible based on the board dimensions and the values of `a` and `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs either the minimum number of moves or the message indicating impossibility.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The core logic correctly implements the mechanics of the problem as described. It checks each corner for valid moves based on the movement rules and ensures that the moves are feasible given the constraints of the chessboard.
- The conditions for determining if the candy can be moved to a corner are accurate and consider both the distance and the required parity of moves.
- The output is correctly formatted based on whether a valid path to a corner exists or not.

### Conclusion:
Since the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
