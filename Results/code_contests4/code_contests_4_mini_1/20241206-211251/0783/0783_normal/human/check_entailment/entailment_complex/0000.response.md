Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is valid in Python 2 but not in Python 3. In Python 3, it should use `input()`. This would cause an error when running the program in Python 3 environments.

2. **Distance Calculation and Conditions**: The program checks if the candy can reach the corners based on the conditions:
   - It calculates `dx` and `dy` as the absolute differences from the current position to each corner.
   - It checks if `dx % a == 0` and `dy % b == 0` and if the number of moves in both directions are even or odd, which is correct in principle. However, it uses integer division `dx / a` and `dy / b` which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `dx // a` and `dy // b` to perform floor division).

3. **Incorrect Output Logic**: The program has a condition `print('Poor Inna and pony!', v)[v < 1 << 55]` which does not clearly meet the requirement of returning either the number of moves or the specific message "Poor Inna and pony!". The way it prints the result is confusing and does not strictly follow the problem's output format.

4. **Logic for Edge Cases**: The additional logic that sets `v` back to `1 << 60` based on `max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b` is not clearly justified in the problem description. The problem requires a valid number of moves to reach a corner, and this check might incorrectly determine unreachable cases.

Overall, the program has a flawed structure and logic that prevents it from accurately determining the minimum moves required or correctly identifying when the candy cannot reach a corner. These issues mean that the program does not meet the problem description requirements in all potential scenarios.
