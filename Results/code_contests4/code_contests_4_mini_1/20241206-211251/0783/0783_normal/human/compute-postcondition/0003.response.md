The value of `dx` is assigned the result of `abs(x - c[0])`. However, the variable `x` is not provided in the initial state, and `c[0]` is the first element of the tuple `c`, which is 1. Since `x` is unknown, the calculation of `dx` cannot be completed. The output state will reflect that `dx` has been calculated using the absolute difference between `x` and 1, but the value of `x` remains unspecified.

Output State: **`v` is 1152921504606846976, `dx` is abs(x - 1)**
