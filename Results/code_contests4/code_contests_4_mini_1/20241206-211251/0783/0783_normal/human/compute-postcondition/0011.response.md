Postcondition: ***`v` is 1152921504606846976. If `dx + dy` equals 0, then `v` remains unchanged, and `dx` is equal to abs(x - 1) while `dy` is equal to abs(y - c[1]). Otherwise, `v` is updated to the minimum of `1152921504606846976` and `max(dx / a, dy / b)` if `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and both `dx / a` and `dy / b` have the same parity. If any of these conditions are not met, `v` remains unchanged.***
