Postcondition: ***`v` is 1152921504606846976, `c` is (n, 1), `dx` cannot be determined due to undefined `x`, and `dy` is abs(y - 1) where `y` is unknown. If `dx % a == 0` and `dy % b == 0` and `(dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2)`, then the value of `v` is updated to the minimum of 1152921504606846976 and the maximum of (dx / a, dy / b), which cannot be calculated due to undefined variables.***
