The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `abs(y - c[1])`. However, the values of `y` and `c[1]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `dy`. The other variables, `v` and `dx`, remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`v` is 1152921504606846976, `dx` is abs(x - 1); `dy` is abs(y - c[1]) but its value cannot be determined.**
