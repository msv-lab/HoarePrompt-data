The variable `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - c[1])`, where `c[1]` is the second element of the tuple `c`, which is 1. The value of `y` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `dy`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is 1152921504606846976, `c` is (n, 1), `dx` is calculated as abs(x - n) but cannot be determined due to undefined x, and `dy` is abs(y - 1) where y is unknown.

Output State: **`v` is 1152921504606846976, `c` is (n, 1), `dx` is calculated as abs(x - n) but cannot be determined due to undefined x, and `dy` is abs(y - 1) where y is unknown.**
