Postcondition: ***`v` is 1152921504606846976. If `dx + dy` equals 0, then `v` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and `dx / a` has the same parity as `dy / b`, then `v` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the maximum of (`dx / a`) and (`dy / b`).***
