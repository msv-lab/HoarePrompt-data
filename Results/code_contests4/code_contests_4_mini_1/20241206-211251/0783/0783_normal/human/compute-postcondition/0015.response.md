The value of `v` is assigned the value `0`, and it overwrites the previous value of `v`, which was `1152921504606846976`. The values of `dx` and `dy` remain unaffected as they are not mentioned in the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is 0; `dx` is abs(x - n); `dy` is abs(y - c[1]) but their specific values are unknown.

Output State: **`v` is 0; `dx` is abs(x - n); `dy` is abs(y - c[1]) but their specific values are unknown.**
