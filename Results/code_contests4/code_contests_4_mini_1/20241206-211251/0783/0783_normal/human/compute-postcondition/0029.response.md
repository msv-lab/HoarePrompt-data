Postcondition: ***`v` is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of (`dx / a`, `dy / b`) for each condition met. If `v` is `1 << 60` and either `max(n - x, x - 1) < a` or `max(m - y, y - 1) < b` holds true, then `v` remains `1 << 60`. If the conditions are not met, `v` will remain unchanged from its initial value.***
