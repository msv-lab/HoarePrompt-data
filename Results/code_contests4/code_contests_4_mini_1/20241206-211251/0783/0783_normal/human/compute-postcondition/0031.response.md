The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as defined in the function signature. However, it operates within the constraints of six integer variables: `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, `1 ≤ j ≤ m`, and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. The function's output is not specified in the given information, so we cannot determine the return value or any conditions that would lead to different outputs. Therefore, without further details on the output behavior, we cannot provide a complete functionality description.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but operates within the constraints of the integers n, m, i, j, a, and b, which are defined by specific ranges. The return value is not specified.**
