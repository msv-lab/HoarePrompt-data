The value of `v` is assigned 0, which directly changes its previous value of 1152921504606846976 to 0. The states of the other variables (`dx`, `dy`, and their relationship) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is 0, `dx` remains as abs(x - 1), `dy` remains as abs(y - c[1]), and the sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0.

Output State: **`v` is 0, `dx` remains as abs(x - 1), `dy` remains as abs(y - c[1]), and the sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0.**
