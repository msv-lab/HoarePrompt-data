Postcondition: ***`v` is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of (`dx / a`, `dy / b`) for each condition met, where `c` takes values from [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]. `dx` and `dy` are calculated as abs(x - c[0]) and abs(y - c[1]) respectively. `v` is updated based on the conditions met. Additionally, `v` is non-zero, and either the maximum of (`n - x`) or (`x - 1`) is less than `a` or the maximum of (`m - y`) or (`y - 1`) is less than `b`. If any of the conditions were not met during any iteration, `v` remains unchanged from its initial value.***
