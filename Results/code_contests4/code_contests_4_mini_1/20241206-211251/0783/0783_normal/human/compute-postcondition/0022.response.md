The value of `v` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables `c`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is 0, `c` is (n, 1), `dx` is calculated as abs(x - n) but cannot be determined due to undefined x, and `dy` is abs(y - 1) where y is unknown.

Output State: **`v` is 0, `c` is (n, 1), `dx` is calculated as abs(x - n) but cannot be determined due to undefined x, and `dy` is abs(y - 1) where y is unknown.**
