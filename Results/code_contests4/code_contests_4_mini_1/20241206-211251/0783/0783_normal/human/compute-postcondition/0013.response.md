The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `abs(x - c[0])`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `c` is the tuple `(n, 1)`, which means `c[0]` is equal to `n`. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `dx` without knowing `x`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship and dependencies of the variables involved.

Output State: **`v` is 1152921504606846976; `dx` is abs(x - n)**
