Output State: **`v` is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of (`dx / a`, `dy / b`) for each condition met, where `c` takes values from [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]. `dx` and `dy` are calculated as abs(x - c[0]) and abs(y - c[1]) respectively. If any of the conditions are not met during any iteration, `v` will remain unchanged from its initial value.**
