To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

The program is designed to find the minimum number of moves required to move a piece of candy from its starting position `(x, y)` to one of the corners of an `n x m` chessboard, following specific movement rules defined by the parameters `a` and `b`. The allowed movements enable the candy to shift diagonally based on the values of `a` (for vertical movement) and `b` (for horizontal movement).

Letâ€™s break down the program:

1. It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It initializes a variable `v` to a large number (representing the minimum number of moves).
3. It then loops through the four corners of the chessboard: `(1, m)`, `(n, 1)`, `(n, m)`, and `(1, 1)`.
4. For each corner, it calculates the required horizontal distance `dx` and vertical distance `dy` from the candy's current position to the corner.
5. It checks if the candy can reach the corner:
   - If both `dx` and `dy` are divisible by `a` and `b` respectively, and if the number of moves required in both directions (after dividing) is either both even or both odd, it calculates the maximum of the two required moves and updates `v` with the minimum moves needed.
6. Finally, it checks if there are any constraints (if the candy can move towards the edges) that would prevent it from making any moves and adjusts `v` accordingly.
7. It outputs either the minimum number of moves or the message "Poor Inna and pony!" if no valid moves are found.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Directly on Corners**: 
   If the candy starts directly on one of the corners, the expected output should be `0`. The program correctly handles this case with `if 0 == dx + dy: v = 0`.

2. **Inaccessible Moves**: 
   If the initial position and the required moves don't allow reaching any corner, the program should output "Poor Inna and pony!". This is handled through the checks based on `dx`, `dy`, and the conditions involving `a` and `b`.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: 
   The program checks if the maximum distance to the edges exceeds `a` or `b`, which is important when the candy is close to the edges of the board.

### Test Case Analysis:

- For the input `5 5 2 3 1 1`, the program outputs "Poor Inna and pony!", which is correct since it cannot reach any corner with the given moves.
- For the input `5 7 1 3 2 2`, the program finds the minimum moves correctly as `2`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to handle various edge cases correctly and adheres to the problem description. The logic for calculating the minimum moves and the conditions for determining if a move is possible are implemented as intended.

Thus, based on the analysis and the reasoning provided, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
