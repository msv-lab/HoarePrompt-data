Correctness: **False**

The given program does not adhere to the problem description. The problem requires sorting a deck of cards by performing a series of operations where you can split the deck into contiguous parts and reverse their order. However, the provided code does not implement any logic for sorting the deck of cards. Instead, it checks if a power of three (i.e., 1, 3, 9, 27, etc.) equals `n`, which is irrelevant to the sorting of the deck.

For instance, if the input is:

```
4
3 1 2 4
```

The expected output should be a series of operations that sorts the deck, such as:

```
2
3 1 2 1
2 1 3
```

However, the provided program will output "NO" for this input, indicating that it is not performing any sorting operations, thereby failing to meet the problem requirements. This demonstrates that the program does not work as expected for valid inputs, confirming its incorrectness.
