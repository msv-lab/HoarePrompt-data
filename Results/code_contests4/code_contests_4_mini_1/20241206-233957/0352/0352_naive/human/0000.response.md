Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description of sorting a deck of cards. Instead, it seems to check if a number `n` can be expressed in the form of powers of 3 (i.e., `n = 3^k` for some integer `k`), which is unrelated to the task of sorting a deck of cards using the described operations. 

For instance, given the input:
```
4
3 1 2 4
```
The program would not generate any operations to sort the deck, which is a requirement of the problem. Thus, it fails to meet the problem's requirements entirely. 

Here's a counterexample for clarity: If the input is `n=4` and the deck is `[3, 1, 2, 4]`, the expected output should include operations that sort the deck, but the program outputs "NO", indicating that it does not even attempt to sort the cards as required.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not implement any logic related to the sorting of the deck of cards.
