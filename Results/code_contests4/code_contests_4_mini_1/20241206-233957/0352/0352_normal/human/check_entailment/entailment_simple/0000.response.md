Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires a function that sorts a deck of cards using a specified operation of splitting and reversing contiguous parts of the deck. In contrast, the given program does not perform any operations on the card deck; it only checks if the number \( n \) is 3 or more and prints "YES" or "NO" based on this condition.

Here are the specific reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Lack of Sorting Logic**: The program does not implement any logic to sort the deck of cards. Instead, it merely checks a condition related to \( n \) and outputs a string based on that condition.

2. **Input Handling**: The program does not read the second line of input, which is necessary to obtain the list of cards that need to be sorted. It only reads the integer \( n \).

3. **No Operations Executed**: The operations that are supposed to be performed on the deck (splitting and reversing parts of the deck) are entirely absent. The program fails to implement the operations required to achieve a sorted deck. 

4. **Incorrect Output**: The output format required by the problem description includes the number of operations performed and the details of each operation. The program does not generate any such output, thereby failing to meet the output requirements.

In conclusion, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, as it does not attempt to sort the deck or implement the specified operations.
