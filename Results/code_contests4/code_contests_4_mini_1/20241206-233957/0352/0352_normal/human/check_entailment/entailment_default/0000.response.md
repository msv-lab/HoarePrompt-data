The given problem description outlines a requirement to sort a deck of cards using specific operations. The provided program, however, does not address this task at all. Instead, it checks whether the input integer \( n \) is a power of 3, which is completely unrelated to sorting a deck of cards.

### Assessment:
1. **Relevance to Problem Description**: The program does not implement any logic to sort the deck of cards or perform operations as described in the problem statement. It only checks if \( n \) is a power of 3.
  
2. **Handling of Cases**: The program does not handle any cases related to the sorting of a card deck. It does not split the deck into parts or reverse them, nor does it produce the required output regarding the number of operations performed or their descriptions.

3. **Output Hints**: The output hints state that the program checks if \( n \) is a power of 3, which is a completely different functionality from what the problem description requires. The output hints do not agree with the problem description, as they describe an entirely different function.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement about sorting a deck of cards, it is incorrect. There are no operations performed on the card deck, and the output does not match the expected format.

Correctness: **False**.
