Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that sorts a deck of cards using a specific operation involving splitting and reversing parts of the deck, with a maximum of n operations. 

However, the actual function instead checks if the number `n` is a power of 3 and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on that condition. It does not perform any sorting operations on the list of cards, nor does it follow the logic outlined in the problem description for sorting the deck. 

In particular:
- The program does not take the list of cards `c` into account at all, despite it being mentioned in the annotations.
- It fails to implement the required operations of splitting and reversing the card deck.
- The output format that is needed according to the problem description is completely missing.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not implement the required functionality to sort the deck of cards as specified in the problem description.
