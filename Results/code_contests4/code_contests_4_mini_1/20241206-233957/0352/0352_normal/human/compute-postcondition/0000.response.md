The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which represents the input from the user and is guaranteed to be an integer within the range of 1 to 52. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.**
