The variable `i` is initialized to the value 1. The value of `n` and the list `c` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `i` is 1**
