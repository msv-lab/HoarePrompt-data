To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the initial conditions and the code provided.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52.
   - `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `sq` is initialized to False.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `i` equals `n` during the loop execution, `sq` is set to True.
   - On each iteration, `i` is multiplied by 3.

3. **Iterations**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` becomes 3 (since 1 * 3 = 3).
   - The loop checks if `i` (which is now 3) is less than or equal to `n`. If true, it continues.
   - The loop will keep executing as long as `i` remains less than or equal to `n` and will multiply `i` by 3 each time.

   Let's analyze how `i` evolves:
   - If `n` is 1, `i` becomes 3 after the first iteration and the loop stops (i.e., `sq` remains False).
   - If `n` is 2, `i` becomes 3 after the first iteration and the loop stops (i.e., `sq` remains False).
   - If `n` is 3, `i` becomes 3 in the first iteration, `sq` becomes True, and then `i` is multiplied to 9 which causes the loop to exit.
   - For any `n` from 4 to 52, `i` will similarly reach 3 in the first iteration, set `sq` to True (if `n` is 3), and then become greater than `n` in subsequent iterations.

4. **Final State**:
   - The loop terminates when `i` exceeds `n`, and `i` will always be a power of 3 (1, 3, 9, 27, ...).
   - `sq` will be True if at least one iteration finds `i` equal to `n`, which happens only when `n` is exactly 1 or 3; for `n` greater than 3, `sq` remains True after the first iteration.
   - The final value of `i` after the last multiplication will be a power of 3 greater than `n`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is greater than `n`, `sq` is True if `n` is 3 or more, otherwise `sq` is False, `n` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged**
