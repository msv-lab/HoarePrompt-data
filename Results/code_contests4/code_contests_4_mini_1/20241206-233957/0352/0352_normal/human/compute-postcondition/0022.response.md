The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on two constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52, and `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. 

The function likely processes the list `c` in relation to the integer `n` and produces a specific output based on these constraints. However, the exact output is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 52) and a list c of n unique integers (each between 1 and n).**
