The value of `i` is multiplied by 3. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, but it is indicated that `i` is an integer that can take any value. Therefore, after the operation, `i` will be 3 times its previous value. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `i` is multiplied by 3.**
