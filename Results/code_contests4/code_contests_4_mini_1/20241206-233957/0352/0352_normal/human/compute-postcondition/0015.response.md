The value of `i` is multiplied by 3. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is an integer that is part of the range defined in the initial state. Since the output does not mention any specific value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact result after the multiplication. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `i` is multiplied by 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `i` is multiplied by 3.**
