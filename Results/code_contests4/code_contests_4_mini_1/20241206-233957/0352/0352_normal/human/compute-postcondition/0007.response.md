The value of `i` is assigned the value `i * 3`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, which is an integer in the range from 1 to 52, `i` will be updated to `3 * n`. The values of `n`, `c`, and `sq` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `i` is equal to `3 * n`; `sq` is set to True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `c` is a list of `n` unique integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `i` is equal to `3 * n`; `sq` is set to True.**
