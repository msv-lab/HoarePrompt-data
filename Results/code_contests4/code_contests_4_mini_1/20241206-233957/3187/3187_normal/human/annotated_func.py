#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), m is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), and for each of the m lines, there are two integers representing pairs of colors (from 1 to n) which harmonize with each other.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, m = rints()
    edges, ans = [rints() for _ in range(m)], [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ans[i - 1].append([i, i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), `edges` is a list of `m` elements, each being a list of integers, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a list with the format [[i, i]] for `i` from 1 to `n`.
    for (i, j) in enumerate(edges):
        ans[j[0] - 1].append([i + n + 1, j[0]])
        
        ans[j[1] - 1].append([i + n + 1, j[1]])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `m` is non-negative and less than or equal to min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)); `edges` is a list of `m` elements; `ans` contains `n` elements, each being a list that includes the initial `[[i, i]]` for `i` from 1 to `n` plus the lists appended for each edge processed.
    for i in range(n):
        print(len(ans[i]))

            print(*j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `ans` contains `n` non-empty iterables, each `ans[i]` has been fully printed, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and `j` is the last element of `ans[n-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes a list of edges representing pairs of harmonizing colors. It constructs a result list for each color and prints the number of entries for each colorâ€™s list, followed by the entries themselves. Each list will include the color itself and any additional colors from the edges. The function does not return any value.
