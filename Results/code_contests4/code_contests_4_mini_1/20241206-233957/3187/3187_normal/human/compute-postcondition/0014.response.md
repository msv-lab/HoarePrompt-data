To analyze the given code snippet, we need to break down the assignment and understand the variables involved:

1. `j` is the second element of the `edges` list, meaning `j` is a tuple or list where `j[0]` and `j[1]` are defined.
2. The variable `i` is 1.
3. The variable `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
4. `ans` is a list that has at least `j[0]` elements, and `ans[j[0] - 1]` is a valid index in `ans`.

The line of code:
```python
ans[j[0] - 1].append([i + n + 1, j[0]])
```
is modifying the `ans` list at the index `j[0] - 1`.

- The value `i + n + 1` is calculated as follows:
  - `i` is 1.
  - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
  - Therefore, `i + n + 1` will range from `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` to `1 + 100 + 1 = 102`, meaning the result of `i + n + 1` will be between 3 and 102.

The `ans[j[0] - 1]` is updated to include the new list `[i + n + 1, j[0]]`, which is `[value_between_3_and_102, j[0]]`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state will reflect the updated `ans` along with the values of `n`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is 1; `j` is the second element of edges; `ans[j[0] - 1]` now includes the list `[value_between_3_and_102, j[0]]` appended to it.**
