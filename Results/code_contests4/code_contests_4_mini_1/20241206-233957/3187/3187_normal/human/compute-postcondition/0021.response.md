In the provided code snippet, `print(len(ans[i]))` is executed. The variable `i` is 0, which means we are accessing the first element of the list or array `ans`. The length of this element is then calculated using the `len()` function and printed. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, it does not affect the length of `ans[i]`, but we assume that `ans` is defined elsewhere and contains at least one element.

The output state reflects the operation performed, focusing on how `i` and `ans` are used:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, and the length of `ans[0]` has been printed.**
