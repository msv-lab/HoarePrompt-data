According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `ans[i]`. If `ans[i]` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is the last element of `ans[0]`. The loop iterates over `ans[i]`, which is `ans[1]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `ans[1]` must contain at least one more element than it currently has. If `j` is the last element of `ans[1]`, then for the loop to execute again, `j` would need to be updated to the next element in `ans[1]`.

Thus, the next state should reflect that `i` remains 1, and `j` needs to be the next element of `ans[1]`, which means `ans[1]` must contain at least 2 elements for the loop to run a second time.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `ans[0]` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is the next element in `ans[1]`, `ans[1]` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements**.
