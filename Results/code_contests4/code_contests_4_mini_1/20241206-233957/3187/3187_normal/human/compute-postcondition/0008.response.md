`ans[i - 1]` refers to the fourth element of the `ans` list since `i` is 3. The previous value of `ans` is `[[1, 1], [2, 2]]`, so `ans[2]` currently does not exist. Therefore, `ans[2]` will be created and will contain the appended value `[3, 3]`. After execution, the state of `ans` will be updated to `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [[3, 3]]]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), `edges` is a list of `m` elements, each being a list of integers, `ans` is [[1, 1], [2, 2], [[3, 3]]], `i` is 3**
