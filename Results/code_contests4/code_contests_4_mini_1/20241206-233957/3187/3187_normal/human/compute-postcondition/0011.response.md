The code appends a list to the `ans` list at the index `j[0] - 1`. The list being appended includes the value `i + n + 1` and `j[0]`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression `i + n + 1` simplifies to `n + 1`. The value of `j` is the first element of the `edges` list, denoted as `j[0]`. 

The output state will reflect the change in `ans` due to this append operation, without affecting the other variables `n`, `m`, `edges`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `j` is the first element of the edges list, and `ans[j[0] - 1]` now includes the list `[n + 1, j[0]]`.**
