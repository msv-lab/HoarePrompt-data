According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, meaning `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` will be 2 in the subsequent iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `ans[0]` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is the last element of `ans[1]`, `ans[1]` is a non-empty iterable, and all elements of `ans[1]` have been printed, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
