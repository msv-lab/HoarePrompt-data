According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans[i]`. For the loop to execute, `ans[i]` must be a non-empty iterable. As stated, `i` is 1, so we need to ensure that `ans[1]` is a non-empty iterable. The variable `j` is already set to the last element of `ans[0]`, but this does not affect the loop execution directly. Hence, we need to focus on the state of `ans[i]`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `ans[1]` must be a non-empty iterable. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `ans[0]` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is the last element of `ans[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[1]` is a non-empty iterable**
