According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the iterable `ans[i]`. For the loop to run a second time, `ans` must have more than one element at index `i`, and `j` will take the next element from `ans[i]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` is the first element of `ans[0]`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must remain 0, and `j` must be set to the next element in `ans[0]`, assuming that `ans[0]` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `j` is the second element of `ans[0]`, for the loop to execute again, `ans[0]` must have at least 2 elements.**
