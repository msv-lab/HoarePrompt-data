According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ans[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[i]` must contain at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` has at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is a valid index, and `ans[i]` contains at least 2 elements. Since `j` is the second element in `ans[i]`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must now be the third element in `ans[i]`, and the index for `j` will be incremented.

State: **`ans` is defined with at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is set to a valid index, for the loop to execute one more time `ans[i]` must contain at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in `ans[i]`.**
