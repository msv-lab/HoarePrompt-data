The code appends a list containing the values `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` to the element of `ans` indexed by `j[1] - 1`. The previous value of `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. The value of `j[1]` is the second element of the `edges` list.

Calculating the new value to be appended:
- The value of `i + n + 1` becomes `0 + n + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 1`.
- `j[1]` remains unchanged.

Since `ans[j[1] - 1]` now has the list `[n + 1, j[1]]` appended to it, the output state shows that the state of `ans` is updated accordingly. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `j` is the first element of the edges list, and `ans[j[1] - 1]` now includes the list `[n + 1, j[1]]` appended to it.**
