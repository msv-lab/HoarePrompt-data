The code `print(*j)` is designed to unpack the elements of the iterable `j` and print them. Given that `ans` is defined with at least `i + 1` elements and `i` is set to a valid index, `j` must be defined as `ans[i]`, which is an iterable. The values of `j` will be printed out as individual arguments.

Since the exact contents of `j` are not provided, we can only state that it will print the elements of `ans[i]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that operation without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`ans` is defined with at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is set to a valid index; `j` is the iterable `ans[i]`, and its elements are printed.**
