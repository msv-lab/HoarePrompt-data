According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the bounds defined in the `range(1, n + 1)`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

The loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), `edges` is a list of `m` elements, each being a list of integers, `ans` is [[1, 1], [2, 2]], `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
