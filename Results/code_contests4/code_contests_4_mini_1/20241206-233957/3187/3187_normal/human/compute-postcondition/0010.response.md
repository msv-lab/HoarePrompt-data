According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the `edges` list. For the loop to execute at least once, the `edges` list must contain at least one element (i.e., `m` must be greater than 0). Since `m` is defined to be a non-negative integer and can be 0, we need to ensure that `m` is adjusted to be at least 1. 

Furthermore, we also have to consider the initialization of the loop variables `i` and `j`. When the loop executes for the first time, `i` will be 0, and `j` will be the first element of the `edges` list. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to state that `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is the first element of the `edges` list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `j` is the first element of the edges list**
