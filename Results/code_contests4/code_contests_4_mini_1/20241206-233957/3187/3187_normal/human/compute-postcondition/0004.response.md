The code appends the list `[i, i]` to the `i - 1` index of the `ans` list. Given that `i` is 1, it means we are appending the list `[1, 1]` to the first (0th index) of the `ans` list. The values of `n`, `m`, and `edges` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), `edges` is a list of `m` elements, each being a list of integers, `ans` is a list with the first element being [[1, 1]], `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), `edges` is a list of `m` elements, each being a list of integers, `ans` is a list with the first element being [[1, 1]], `i` is 1.**
