Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes a list of edges representing pairs of harmonizing colors. It constructs a result list for each color and prints the number of entries for each colorâ€™s list, followed by the entries themselves. Each list will include the color itself and any additional colors from the edges. The function does not return any value. **
