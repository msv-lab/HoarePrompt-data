The code assigns a new list to `ans[j[0] - 1]` by appending the list `[i + n + 1, j[0]]`. The value of `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, while `j[0]` is used as an index for `ans`. Thus, the value being appended is `[2 + n + 1, j[0]]`, which simplifies to `[n + 3, j[0]]`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values and the modification made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is 2; `j` is the third element of edges; `ans[j[0] - 1]` is updated with the value `[n + 3, j[0]]`.**
