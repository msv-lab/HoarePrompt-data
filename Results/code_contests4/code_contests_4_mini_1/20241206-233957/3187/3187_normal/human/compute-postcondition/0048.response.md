The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by its definition. It operates within the constraints that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq \min(1000, \frac{n(n-1)}{2})\). Additionally, for each of the `m` lines, there are two integers representing pairs of colors (from 1 to `n`) which harmonize with each other. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot provide details on what it returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate based on the defined constraints and relationships of `n`, `m`, and the pairs of colors, although the exact output is not described. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the constraints of n and m, with pairs of colors that harmonize with each other. The output is not specified.**
