The code appends a new list containing `[i, i]` to the `ans` list at the index `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index `1` of `ans` will receive the value `[2, 2]`. The initial state of `ans` is `[[1, 1]]`, so after the operation, `ans` will be updated to `[[1, 1], [2, 2]]`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), `edges` is a list of `m` elements, each being a list of integers, `ans` is [[1, 1], [2, 2]], `i` is 2**
