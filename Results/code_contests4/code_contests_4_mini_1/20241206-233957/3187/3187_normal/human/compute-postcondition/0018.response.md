To analyze the given code snippet, we start with the initial state where:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is defined as the third element of `edges`.
- `ans[j[0] - 1]` is updated with the value `[n + 3, j[0]]`.

Now, the code line being executed is:

```
ans[j[1] - 1].append([i + n + 1, j[1]])
```

We can break it down as follows:

1. `j[1]` is an index that will access the `ans` list.
2. The expression `i + n + 1` calculates the value to be appended. Given `i` is 2, this becomes `2 + n + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 3`.
3. Thus, we are appending the list `[n + 3, j[1]]` to `ans[j[1] - 1]`.

The variables `n` and `j` directly influence the output. However, since `n` is unspecified but is within the range of 1 to 100, we denote it as such. The value of `ans` at index `j[1] - 1` is modified to include the new list.

The output state reflects the changes made:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is 2; `j` is the third element of edges; `ans[j[1] - 1]` now includes `[n + 3, j[1]]`.**
