You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ivan is a novice painter. He has n dyes of different colors. He also knows exactly m pairs of colors which harmonize with each other.

Ivan also enjoy playing chess. He has 5000 rooks. He wants to take k rooks, paint each of them in one of n colors and then place this k rooks on a chessboard of size 10^{9} × 10^{9}.

Let's call the set of rooks on the board connected if from any rook we can get to any other rook in this set moving only through cells with rooks from this set. Assume that rooks can jump over other rooks, in other words a rook can go to any cell which shares vertical and to any cell which shares horizontal.

Ivan wants his arrangement of rooks to have following properties:

  * For any color there is a rook of this color on a board;
  * For any color the set of rooks of this color is connected;
  * For any two different colors a b union of set of rooks of color a and set of rooks of color b is connected if and only if this two colors harmonize with each other.



Please help Ivan find such an arrangement.

Input

The first line of input contains 2 integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000,    (n(n-1))/(2))) — number of colors and number of pairs of colors which harmonize with each other.

In next m lines pairs of colors which harmonize with each other are listed. Colors are numbered from 1 to n. It is guaranteed that no pair occurs twice in this list.

Output

Print n blocks, i-th of them describes rooks of i-th color.

In the first line of block print one number a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5000) — number of rooks of color i. In each of next a_{i} lines print two integers x and y (1 ≤ x,    y ≤ 10^{9}) — coordinates of the next rook.

All rooks must be on different cells.

Total number of rooks must not exceed 5000.

It is guaranteed that the solution exists.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), m is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), and for each of the m lines, there are two integers representing pairs of colors (from 1 to n) which harmonize with each other.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, m = rints()
    edges, ans = [rints() for _ in range(m)], [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ans[i - 1].append([i, i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), `edges` is a list of `m` elements, each being a list of integers, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a list with the format [[i, i]] for `i` from 1 to `n`.
    for (i, j) in enumerate(edges):
        ans[j[0] - 1].append([i + n + 1, j[0]])
        
        ans[j[1] - 1].append([i + n + 1, j[1]])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `m` is non-negative and less than or equal to min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)); `edges` is a list of `m` elements; `ans` contains `n` elements, each being a list that includes the initial `[[i, i]]` for `i` from 1 to `n` plus the lists appended for each edge processed.
    for i in range(n):
        print(len(ans[i]))
        
        for j in ans[i]:
            print(*j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `ans` contains `n` non-empty iterables, each `ans[i]` has been fully printed, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and `j` is the last element of `ans[n-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes a list of edges representing pairs of harmonizing colors. It constructs a result list for each color and prints the number of entries for each color’s list, followed by the entries themselves. Each list will include the color itself and any additional colors from the edges. The function does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
