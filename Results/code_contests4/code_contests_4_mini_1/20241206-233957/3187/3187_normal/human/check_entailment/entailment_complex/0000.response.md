Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Rook Placement**: The problem states that each color must have a connected set of rooks on the board and that rooks can be placed at any coordinate on a chessboard of size \(10^9 \times 10^9\). However, the program places rooks at coordinates that are derived from their indices and the edges provided, which could lead to overlapping coordinates or non-unique placements, violating the requirement that all rooks must be on different cells.

2. **Connectedness Requirement**: The program does not guarantee that the sets of rooks corresponding to each color are connected as required. While it attempts to append additional entries based on the harmonizing edges, it does not ensure that the union of sets of rooks for two colors is connected only if they harmonize, and it also does not ensure that the sets of rooks of each individual color are connected.

3. **Output Format**: The output format specified in the problem requires specific coordinates for the rooks, and while the program does intend to print coordinates, the logic used to generate them does not meet the problem's constraints regarding connectedness and uniqueness. 

4. **Harmonizing Pairs**: The program does not adequately handle the harmonizing pairs. The output must reflect that if two colors harmonize, their rooks can connect, but there is no clear mechanism in the code that ensures this.

In summary, the program fails to produce a valid arrangement of rooks that meets all the criteria specified in the problem description, particularly regarding connectedness and uniqueness of the rook placements.
