d is a positive integer representing the total length of the loop line (2 ≤ d ≤ 1,000,000,000), n is a positive integer representing the number of stores (2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), m is a positive integer representing the number of orders (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), di are integers representing the locations of stores (1 ≤ di ≤ d - 1) that are all different, and ki are integers representing the delivery destination locations (0 ≤ ki ≤ d - 1).
