The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`, `sum` is initialized to 0, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
