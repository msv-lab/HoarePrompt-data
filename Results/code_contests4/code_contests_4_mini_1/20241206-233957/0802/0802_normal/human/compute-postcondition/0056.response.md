The value of `sum` is incremented by `i`. The previous value of `sum` is 3, and since `i` is greater than or equal to 2, we cannot determine the specific value of `i`. Therefore, after execution, `sum` will be equal to `3 + i`. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`sum` is `3 + i`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2**
