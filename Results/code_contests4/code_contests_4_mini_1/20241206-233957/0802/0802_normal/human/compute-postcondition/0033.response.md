The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is now equal to `2`; `i` is 3.
