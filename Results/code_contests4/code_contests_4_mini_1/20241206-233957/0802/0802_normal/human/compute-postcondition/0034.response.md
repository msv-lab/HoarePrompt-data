Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. There is no need to make any adjustments to the program state for it to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is now equal to `2`; `i` is 3**
