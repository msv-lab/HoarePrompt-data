Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to modify any state variables to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`, `sum` is initialized to 0, `i` is 3**
