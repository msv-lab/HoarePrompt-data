The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were in. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is initialized to 0; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
