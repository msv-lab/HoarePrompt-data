According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the collection `K`. If `K` has more elements remaining, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sum` is now equal to `2 + i`, where `i` is an integer that satisfies the given condition. The variable `k` will take on the next value from `K` in the next iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are more elements in `K` to iterate over. If `k` was the current element in the last iteration, then for the next iteration, `k` must be the next element in `K`, and the condition for `i` remains unchanged.

State: **`sum` is now equal to `2 + i`, for the loop to execute one more time `K` must have at least one more element, and `k` will be the next element in `K`.**
