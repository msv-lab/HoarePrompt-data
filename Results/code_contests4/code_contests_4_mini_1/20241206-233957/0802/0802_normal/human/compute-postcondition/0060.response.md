The `f.close()` statement closes the file that was opened for writing. The values of the variables `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, and `sum` remain unchanged, but the action indicates that no further writing can be done to the file 'output.txt'. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is the total of all `i` values found for each `k` in `K`, where each `i` satisfies the loop termination condition; the file 'output.txt' is now closed.
