The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is now equal to `2`; `i` is 1; and either `(k + 1) % 8` is in `S` or `(k - 1) % 8` is in `S`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
