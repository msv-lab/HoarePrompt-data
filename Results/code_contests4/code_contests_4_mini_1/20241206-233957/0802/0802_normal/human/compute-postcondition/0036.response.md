Postcondition: ***`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is now equal to `2`; `i` is 3. If `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
