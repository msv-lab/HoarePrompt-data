The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`, `sum` is initialized to 0, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`, `sum` is initialized to 0, `i` is 3**
