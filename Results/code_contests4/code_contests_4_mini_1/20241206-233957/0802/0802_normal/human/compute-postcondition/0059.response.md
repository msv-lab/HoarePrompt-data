Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is the total of all `i` values found for each `k` in `K`, where each `i` satisfies the loop termination condition; a file named 'output.txt' is opened for writing, and the string representation of `sum` is written to the file.**
