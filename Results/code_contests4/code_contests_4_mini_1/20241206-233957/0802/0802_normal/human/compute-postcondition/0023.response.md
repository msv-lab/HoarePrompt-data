According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `K`. Since `K` is a non-empty substring, it has at least one character, and the loop continues to iterate over each character in `K`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `k` is the last character of `K`, and `i` satisfies the loop termination condition. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `K` should have at least one more character beyond the current position of `k`.

However, since `K` is a substring starting from index `3 + n - 1`, it's unclear how many characters are left in `K` without additional information about its length. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the state accurately for the next iteration without knowing the length of `K`.

Thus, we can say that after adjusting for the next potential iteration, `i` would increment by 1, but we can't definitively set a condition for `K` without more context.

State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`, `sum` is now equal to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `K` must have at least one more character beyond the current position of `k`.**
