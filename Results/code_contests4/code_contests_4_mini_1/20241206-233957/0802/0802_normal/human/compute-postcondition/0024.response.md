`i` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state does not provide any previous value for `i`, but since `i` is being explicitly set to `1`, it will now hold this value. The other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is now equal to `i + 1`, which would be `2` since `i` is `1`.
