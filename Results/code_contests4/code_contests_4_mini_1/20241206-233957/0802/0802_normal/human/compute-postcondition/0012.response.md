The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is initialized to 0; `i` is 2; if either `(k + i) % 8` is in `S` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
