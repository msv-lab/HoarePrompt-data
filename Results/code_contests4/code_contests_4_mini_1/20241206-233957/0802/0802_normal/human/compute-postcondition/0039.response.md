In this code snippet, the variable `sum` is incremented by the value of `i`. The initial value of `sum` is `2`, and `i` is an integer that will be determined based on the condition involving `k`, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. 

Since `i` will be incremented until the condition is met, it can take on various values, but we don't know its exact value at this moment. Thus, after executing the code, `sum` will be updated to `2 + i`. The value of `i` is unknown, so we cannot specify the exact new value of `sum`.

The output state reflects the change in the value of `sum` without affecting the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is now equal to `2 + i`, where `i` is an integer that satisfies the given condition.

Output State: **`sum` is now equal to `2 + i`, where `i` is an integer that satisfies the given condition.**
