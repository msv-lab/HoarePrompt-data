The loop iterates over each character in the substring `K`. For each character `k`, it initializes `i` to 1 and continuously increments `i` until it finds a value such that either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is present in the set `S`. Once it finds such an `i`, it adds that value to `sum`. 

Since `K` is a non-empty substring, the loop will execute for each character in `K`. The final value of `sum` will be the cumulative total of all values of `i` found during each iteration of the loop.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `sum` will be equal to the total of all `i` values that met the termination condition for each character in `K`.

Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is the total of all `i` values found for each `k` in `K`, where each `i` satisfies the loop termination condition.**
