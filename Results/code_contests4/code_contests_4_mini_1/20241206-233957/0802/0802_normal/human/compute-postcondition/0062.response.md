Functionality: ** The function reads integer inputs from a file, where the first three integers represent the length of the loop line `d`, the number of stores `n`, and the number of orders `m`. It gathers the locations of the stores into a set and the delivery destination locations into a list. For each delivery location, it calculates the smallest integer `i` such that either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` matches one of the store locations. The function then sums these `i` values and writes the total to an output file. The function does not handle any termination condition for the input reading beyond the specified three integers and will fail if the input does not meet the expected format. Additionally, it does not explicitly check for edge cases like out-of-bounds errors or invalid input.**
