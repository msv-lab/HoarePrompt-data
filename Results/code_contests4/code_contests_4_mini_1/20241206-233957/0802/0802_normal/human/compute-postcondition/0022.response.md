The value of `sum` is incremented by `i`, where `i` is a variable that satisfies the condition of terminating the loop. Since `sum` is initialized to 0, after execution, `sum` will be equal to `i`. The states of the other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is now equal to `i`; `i` satisfies the loop termination condition.
