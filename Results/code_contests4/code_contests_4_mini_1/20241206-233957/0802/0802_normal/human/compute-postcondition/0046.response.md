The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is equal to 3, `i` is 2, and if either `(k + 1) % 8` is in `S` or `(k - 1) % 8` is in `S`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
