Since the `while` loop is defined as `while True`, this means that the loop is designed to execute indefinitely, regardless of the state of any variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`, `sum` is initialized to 0, `i` is 1**.
