According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless a break statement is encountered. Since there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing again, there is no need to adjust any states. 

State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is initialized to 0; `i` is 2**.
