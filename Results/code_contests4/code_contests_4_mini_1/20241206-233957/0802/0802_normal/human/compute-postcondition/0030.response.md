Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is now equal to `2`; `i` is 2; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
