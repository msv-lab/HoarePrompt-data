Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to continue.

State: **`sum` is equal to 3, `i` is 2, and if either `(k + 1) % 8` is in `S` or `(k - 1) % 8` is in `S`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
