Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely. This means that the loop will execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables provided.

Since no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute, I will simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`d`, `n`, `m` are positive integers; `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`; `K` is a substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`; `sum` is now equal to `2`; `i` is 1**
