The value of `i` is assigned to `1`. The previous value of `sum` is `2 + i`. Since `i` is now `1`, `sum` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is now equal to `2 + 1`, which is `3`, and `i` is `1`.

Output State: **`sum` is now equal to `3`, `i` is 1**
