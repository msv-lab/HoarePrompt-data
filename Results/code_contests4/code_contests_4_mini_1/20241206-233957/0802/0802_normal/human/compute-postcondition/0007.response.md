The variable `i` is assigned the value `1`. Other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `S` is a set of sorted integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `K` is a non-empty substring of the input starting from index `3 + n - 1`, `sum` is initialized to 0, `i` is 1.
