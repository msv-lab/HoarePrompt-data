Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the recurrence formula for approximating the cube root of a positive integer `q` as specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple datasets until it encounters `-1`, which is the termination condition, in accordance with the problem statement.

2. **Initial Guess**: It correctly initializes `x` with `q / 2.0`, which is a valid starting point for the iterative method.

3. **Iterative Calculation**: The while loop continuously refines the value of `x` using the formula:
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2}
   \]
   This is in line with the recurrence relation provided.

4. **Stopping Condition**: The loop checks if the absolute difference \( |x^3 - q| \) is less than \( 0.00001 \times q \) to determine when to stop the iteration. This correctly implements the condition for "small enough" as described.

5. **Output Format**: The program formats the output to six decimal places, which satisfies the requirement for the output precision.

Given that the program adheres strictly to the problem requirements and correctly handles the computation and stopping criteria, it should work correctly for all valid inputs in the specified range. No edge cases are identified that would cause the program to fail based on the outlined logic.
