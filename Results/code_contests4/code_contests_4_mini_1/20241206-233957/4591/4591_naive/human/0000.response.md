Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the method to approximate the cube root of a positive integer \( q \) using the recurrence formula as described in the problem statement. 

1. It initializes \( x_1 \) as \( \frac{q}{2} \).
2. It iteratively updates \( x_n \) using the formula \( x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2} \).
3. The loop continues until the condition \( |x_n^3 - q| < 0.00001 \cdot q \) is satisfied, which meets the requirement of stopping when the difference is small enough.
4. The program correctly handles multiple datasets and stops processing when it encounters -1.

Since the logic adheres to the problem requirements and correctly handles the edge cases outlined (such as the termination condition), there do not appear to be any errors or missing logic. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
