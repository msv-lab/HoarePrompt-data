Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it can execute indefinitely as long as the program continues running. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`line` is the first positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is `q / 2.0`, `diff` is `q * 1e-05`**
