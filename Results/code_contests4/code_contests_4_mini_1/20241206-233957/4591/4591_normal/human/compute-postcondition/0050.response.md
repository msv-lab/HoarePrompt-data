In the provided code snippet, `x` is updated using the formula `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`. 

1. The current value of `x` is 1.5 and `q` is 3.
2. First, we calculate `x ** 3`, which is `1.5 ** 3 = 3.375`.
3. Next, we compute `x ** 3 - q`, which is `3.375 - 3 = 0.375`.
4. Then we calculate `3 * x * x`, which is `3 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 6.75`.
5. Now we can compute the fraction: `(x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`, which is `0.375 / 6.75 = 0.05555555556`.
6. Finally, we update `x`: `x = 1.5 - 0.05555555556 = 1.44444444444`.

The other variables (`line` and `diff`) are not affected, so the output state reflects the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`line` is 3, `q` is 3, `x` is approximately 1.44444444444, `diff` is 0.00003**.
