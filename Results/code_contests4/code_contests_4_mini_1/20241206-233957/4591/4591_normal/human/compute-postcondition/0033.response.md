According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely unless a break condition is met. Since there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing again, I do not need to make any adjustments to the program state. 

State: **`line` is 2, `q` is 2, `x` is approximately 1.3333, `diff` is 2e-05.**
