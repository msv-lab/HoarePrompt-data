The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is the first positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is updated, `diff` is `q * 1e-05`, and the absolute value of `x` cubed minus `q` is less than `diff`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
