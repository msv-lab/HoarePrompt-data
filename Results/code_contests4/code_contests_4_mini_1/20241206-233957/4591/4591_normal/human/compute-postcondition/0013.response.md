The variable `x` is updated using the formula `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`. The value of `x` is changed based on its current value and the value of `q`. The value of `diff` is also provided but does not directly affect the calculation of `x`. 

Since `line` and `diff` are not utilized in the expression for `x`, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `x` after applying the calculation.

Output State: **`line` is the first positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, and `x` is updated to `x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`**.
