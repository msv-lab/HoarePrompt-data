According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input data from `stdin`. The loop will run as long as there are positive integers to process, and it will stop when it encounters -1. 

To ensure that the loop executes, there must be at least one positive integer (q) provided before the -1. The loop will start processing from the first line of input. We also need to consider that initially, the loop variable `line` will be assigned the first line of input. 

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, we need the following conditions:
1. There is at least one dataset (a positive integer q).
2. `line` should be the first positive integer q read from the input.

State: **for the loop to execute the first time, `line` is the first positive integer q from stdin (where q > 0)**
