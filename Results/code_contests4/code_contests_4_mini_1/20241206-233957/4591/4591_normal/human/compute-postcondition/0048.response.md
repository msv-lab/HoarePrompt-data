The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `q * 1e-05`. Given that `q` is 3, we calculate `diff` as follows:

`diff = 3 * 1e-05` which results in `diff = 0.00003`.

The values of `line` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is 3, `q` is 3, `x` is 1.5, and `diff` is 0.00003.

Output State: **`line` is 3, `q` is 3, `x` is 1.5, `diff` is 0.00003**
