The value of `x` is updated based on the formula provided. The initial value of `x` is `q / 2.0`, and `q` is a positive integer. The expression calculates a new value for `x` using the formula `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`. This updates `x` based on its current value and the value of `q`. The other variables `line` and `diff` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`line` is the first positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is updated, `diff` is `q * 1e-05`**
