`q` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, where `line` is the first positive integer read from standard input (stdin). Since `line` is a positive integer, `q` will also be that positive integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is the first positive integer q from stdin, `q` is that positive integer.

Output State: **`line` is the first positive integer q from stdin, `q` is that positive integer**
