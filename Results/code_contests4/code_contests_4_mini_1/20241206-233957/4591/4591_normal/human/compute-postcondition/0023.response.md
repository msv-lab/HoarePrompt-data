`q` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, where `line` is the first positive integer + 1. Since `line` is a positive integer, `q` will be the integer representation of `line`, which is also a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is the first positive integer + 1; `q` is the integer value of `line`.

Output State: **`line` is the first positive integer + 1; `q` is the integer value of `line`**
