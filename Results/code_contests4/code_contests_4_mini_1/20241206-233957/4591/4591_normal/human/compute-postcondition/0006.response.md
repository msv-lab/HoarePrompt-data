The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `q * 1e-05`. The value of `q` is a positive integer, so `diff` becomes a small positive value, specifically `q` multiplied by 0.00001. The values of `line` and `x` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is the first positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is `q / 2.0`, and `diff` is `q * 1e-05`.

Output State: **`line` is the first positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is `q / 2.0`, `diff` is `q * 1e-05`**
