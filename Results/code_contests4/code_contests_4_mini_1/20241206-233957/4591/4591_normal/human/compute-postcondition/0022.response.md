According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. The variable `line` represents the current line being read from `stdin`, and since `line` is the first positive integer, it indicates that there are more lines to read as long as there is input available. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is the first positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line available in `stdin` to read, which means `line` should be incremented and will represent the next positive integer.

State: **`line` is the first positive integer + 1, for the loop to execute again there must be another line in stdin.**
