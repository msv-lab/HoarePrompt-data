To assess the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze both the code and the problem description, looking for any discrepancies or edge cases that may not be handled properly.

### Problem Description:
The task is to compute the cube root of a positive integer `q` using an iterative method defined by the recurrence relation:
1. Start with `x_1 = q / 2`
2. Update using `x_{n+1} = x_n - (x_n^3 - q) / (3 * x_n^2)`
3. Stop when `|x^3 - q| < 0.00001 * q`
4. Read multiple datasets until `-1` is encountered.

### Analyzing the Code:
```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

for line in stdin:
    q = int(line)
    if q == -1:
        break
    x = q / 2.0
    diff = q * 1e-05
    while True:
        x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)
        if abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff:
            break
    print('{:.6f}'.format(x))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads from standard input and terminates when it encounters `-1`. It assumes that all inputs are valid integers, which is consistent with the problem description but does not handle any invalid input scenarios.

2. **Initial Approximation**: The program initializes `x` as `q / 2.0`, which is correct.

3. **Iterative Calculation**: The while loop continues to update `x` using the specified recurrence relation until the stopping condition is met. The condition `abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff` ensures that the approximation is sufficiently close to the actual cube root.

4. **Output Formatting**: The result is printed with six decimal places, which matches the problem requirement.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle invalid input types. If non-integer input is provided, it will raise an error.
- The code does not explicitly handle the case when `q = 1`, where the cube root is exactly `1.0`. However, since the method used is iterative and the stopping condition is based on the difference, it should correctly converge to `1.0` without issues.
- Since `q` must be a positive integer, the program implicitly assumes valid input according to the constraints.

### Output Hints:
The output hints accurately describe the program's functionality, including reading multiple datasets, calculating the cube root iteratively, and formatting the output.

### Conclusion:
The code meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases within the valid input constraints (positive integers less than \(2^{31}\)). The only limitation is the lack of input validation for non-integer or invalid input types, but since the problem states that it assumes valid input, this does not detract from the correctness of the implementation based on the described functionality.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
