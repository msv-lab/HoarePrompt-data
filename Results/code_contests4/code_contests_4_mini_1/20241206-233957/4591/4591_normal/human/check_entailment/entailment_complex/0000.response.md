Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the algorithm to approximate the cube root of a positive integer \( q \) as specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple datasets of positive integers until it encounters -1, which signals the end of input. This aligns with the problem description that states that multiple datasets will be provided and the input will terminate with -1.

2. **Initial Approximation**: The program initializes \( x \) to \( \frac{q}{2} \), which is consistent with the problem description that suggests starting with a positive number approximately equal to \( \frac{q}{2} \).

3. **Recurrence Formula**: The iterative method used in the while loop correctly implements the recurrence formula:
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2}
   \]
   This formula is applied in the loop to refine the approximation of the cube root.

4. **Stopping Condition**: The condition for stopping the iteration is when \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \cdot q \). The code correctly translates this condition into:
   \[
   \text{if } abs(x^3 - q) < diff
   \]
   where \( diff \) is defined as \( q \cdot 1e-05 \), matching the problem's requirement.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the result formatted to six decimal places as required by the problem description.

6. **Multiple Datasets**: The program is designed to handle up to 50 datasets efficiently, adhering to the constraints outlined in the problem description.

Given these points, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and correctly implements the algorithm for calculating the cube root of \( q \).
