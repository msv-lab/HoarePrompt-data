Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement for finding the cube root of a positive integer \( q \). Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple datasets from standard input until it encounters `-1`, which is the termination signal. This aligns perfectly with the problem description that states the input consists of multiple datasets ending with `-1`.

2. **Initial Guess for x**: The program sets the initial guess \( x \) to \( \frac{q}{2} \), as specified in the problem description.

3. **Recurrence Formula**: The program correctly applies the recurrence formula:
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2}
   \]
   This is implemented in the `while True` loop, where \( x \) is updated according to the formula.

4. **Convergence Condition**: The program checks if \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \cdot q \) to determine when to stop the iteration. This matches the requirement stated in the problem description for deciding when the approximation is "small enough".

5. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the final value of \( x \) formatted to six decimal places, which adheres to the requirement that the output result may contain an error of \( 0.00001 \) or less.

6. **Handling of Multiple Datasets**: The program processes up to 50 datasets, consistent with the problem constraints.

Overall, this program correctly implements the iterative method for approximating the cube root of \( q \) as described, and handles input and output as specified. Thus, it fulfills all the requirements of the problem description.
