`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so `j` becomes 3. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 2, and `i` remains 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 2**
