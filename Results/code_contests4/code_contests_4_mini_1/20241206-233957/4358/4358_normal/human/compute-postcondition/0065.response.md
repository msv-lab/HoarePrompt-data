`b` is appended with the value `1`. Since `a` is now `[[b], b]`, it is important to note that `b` is a list that is referenced in both positions within `a`. Therefore, appending `1` to `b` will affect both instances of `b` in `a`. The output state does not affect the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `a` now contains `[[b, 1], b]`, and `b` has been modified to include `1`.**
