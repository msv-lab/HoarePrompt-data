The value of `n` is assigned the value from `input()`, which accepts user input. Since `n` is defined as an integer in the initial state, it will now be a string representation of the input value. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of the input value; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the input value; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'**.
