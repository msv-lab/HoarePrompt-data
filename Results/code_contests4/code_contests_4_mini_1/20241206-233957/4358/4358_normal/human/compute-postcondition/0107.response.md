`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 1, `j` becomes 2. The values of `n`, `p`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `j` is 2, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `j` is 2, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.**
