To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the loop:

```
while j < len(s):
```

Here, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of the string `s`. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0.
- `p` is a map object of distinct integers.
- `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix.
- `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `a` is [].
- `b` is an empty list.
- `s` is an input string.

Steps to evaluate:
1. **Evaluate `len(s)`**: For the loop to execute, the condition `j < len(s)` must be satisfied. Since `j` is currently 0, `len(s)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **Current state of `j`**: The variable `j` is already set to 0, which is fine as long as `len(s)` is greater than 0.

Since we need `len(s)` to ensure that it's greater than 0, we can conclude:

State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` is [], `b` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `len(s)` must be greater than 0**
