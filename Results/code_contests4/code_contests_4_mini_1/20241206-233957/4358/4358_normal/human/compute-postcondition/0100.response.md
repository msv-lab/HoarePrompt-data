Initial State: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1; `j` is 3; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` and `p[i]` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.

In the code snippet, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. Since `tmp` holds the value of `p[i]`, this means `p[j]` will now store the value that was originally in `p[i]`. Other variables such as `n` and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1; `j` is 3; `p[j]` now holds the value of `p[i]` (the original value of `p[i]` before the assignment).

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1; `j` is 3; `p[j]` now holds the value of `p[i]`**.
