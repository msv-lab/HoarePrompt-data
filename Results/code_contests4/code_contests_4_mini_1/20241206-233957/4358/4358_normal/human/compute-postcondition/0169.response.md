The variable `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which was previously assigned the value of `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, after this assignment, `p[j]` will now hold the same value as `p[i]`. The value of `tmp` remains unchanged. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]` (which is now the value of `tmp`), and `tmp` is the original value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, and `tmp` is the original value of `p[i]`**.
