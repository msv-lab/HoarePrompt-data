`j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1, `j` is 3, and the assignment cannot be completed due to undefined variables `p` and `tmp`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1, `j` is 3, and the assignment cannot be completed due to undefined variables `p` and `tmp`.**
