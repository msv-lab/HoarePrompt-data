Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and if `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, and `tmp` holds the original value of `p[i]`. If `p[i]` is not greater than `p[j]`, the state of `p` and `tmp` remains unchanged.**
