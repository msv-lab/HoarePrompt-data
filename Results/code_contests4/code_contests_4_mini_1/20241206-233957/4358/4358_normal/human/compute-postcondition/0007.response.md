The variable `b` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous values of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `A`, `__author__`, `i`, `j`, `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` is [], and `b` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` is [], `b` is an empty list**
