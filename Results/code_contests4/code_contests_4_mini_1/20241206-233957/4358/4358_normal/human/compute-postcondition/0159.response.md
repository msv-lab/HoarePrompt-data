The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since `i` is initially 2, after execution, `i` becomes 3. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 3**
