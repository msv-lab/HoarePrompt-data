The variable `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after the execution, `j` will be 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and the condition regarding `s[j]` has not been evaluated in this context.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
