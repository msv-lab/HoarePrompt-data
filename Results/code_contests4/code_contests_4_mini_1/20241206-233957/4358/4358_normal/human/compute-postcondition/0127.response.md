Given the initial state:

- `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4
- `j` is 4
- `i` is 1
- `p` is modified at index 1 to hold the value of `p[4]`
- `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`

Now, analyzing the code:

1. `tmp` is already assigned the value of `p[1]` before the execution of `p[j] = tmp`.
2. `p[j]` refers to `p[4]`, and it is being assigned the value of `tmp`, which is `p[1]`.
3. Therefore, the value at index 4 of the list `p` will now hold the value that was previously at index 1.

This operation modifies `p`, specifically the value at index 4, without affecting the other variables. The output state indicates the changes to `p` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `j` is 4, `i` is 1, `p[4]` now holds the value of `p[1]**
