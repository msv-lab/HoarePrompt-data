Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 3, and `i` is 1. If `a[i][j]` equals 1 and `a[j][i]` equals 1, the value of `p` at index 1 is updated to the value at index 3, and the value of `p[j]` is updated to `tmp`. If the condition is not met, the values of `p` remain unchanged.***
