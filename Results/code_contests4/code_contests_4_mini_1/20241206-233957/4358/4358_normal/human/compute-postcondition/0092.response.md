The assignment attempts to assign the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`, but since `p` and `i` are undefined variables, the operation cannot be executed, and thus the output state cannot reflect any changes to them. The values of `n` and `j` remain unaffected, and the status of `tmp` is still indeterminate.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1, `j` is 2, but `tmp` cannot be determined due to undefined variables `p` and `i`.**
