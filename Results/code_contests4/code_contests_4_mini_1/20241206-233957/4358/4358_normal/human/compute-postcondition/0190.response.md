The value of `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `j` will be `1 + 1`, which equals 2. The previous value of `n`, which is a string representation of a number greater than 1, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
