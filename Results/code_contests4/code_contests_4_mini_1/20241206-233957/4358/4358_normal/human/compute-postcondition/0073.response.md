The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
