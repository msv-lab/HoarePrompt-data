According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, it is also greater than 2 (as it's a string representation of a number greater than 1). Therefore, the loop can execute again. No adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1, `j` is 2**
