Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, and `p` remains unchanged unless `p[i] > p[j]` is true and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` equal 1, in which case `p[1]` is updated to `p[3]` and `p[j]` is updated to `tmp`. If the condition is not met, the values of `p` remain unchanged.***
