The variable `tmp` is assigned the value `p[i]`. However, the values of `p` and `i` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine what `tmp` will hold. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1, `j` is 2, but `tmp` cannot be determined due to undefined variables `p` and `i`.**
