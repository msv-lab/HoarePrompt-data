The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since it is given that `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, after this assignment, `p[i]` will now be equal to `p[j]`, and the previous value of `p[i]` is no longer relevant for this state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, the value of `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, the value of `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1.**
