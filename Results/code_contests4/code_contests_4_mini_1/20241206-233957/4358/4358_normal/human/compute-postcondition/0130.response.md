The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 4, so after execution, `j` becomes 5. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `j` is 5, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `j` is 5, `i` is 1**
