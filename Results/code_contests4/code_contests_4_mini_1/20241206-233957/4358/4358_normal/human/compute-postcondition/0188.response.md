The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n` and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, and the potential swap conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, and potential swap conditions remain unchanged.**
