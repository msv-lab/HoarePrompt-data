The value at index `j` of `p` is assigned to the value at index `i` of `p`. Since it is given that `j` is 2, the value at index `j` is taken from `p` and it replaces the value at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 2, `p` is updated at index `i` to the value at index `j`, `i` is 1, the value at index `i` of `p` is now equal to the value at index `j` of `p`, the value at index `i` of `a` is equal to 1, and the value at index `j` of `a` is also equal to 1; `tmp` remains unchanged since it is only assigned the value at index `i` of `p` prior to the update.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 2, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, `i` is 1, the value at index `i` of `a` is equal to 1, and the value at index `j` of `a` is also equal to 1; `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` of `p`.**
