The value of `b` is an empty list at the beginning. The code `b.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `b`. After this operation, the list `b` will contain one element, which is `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` is [b], and `b` is now [0].

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` is [b], and `b` is now [0]**.
