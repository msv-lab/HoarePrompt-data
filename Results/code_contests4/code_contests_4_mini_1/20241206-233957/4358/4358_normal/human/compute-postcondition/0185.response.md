Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `tmp` holds the original value of `p[0]`. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, and if `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, and `n` remains greater than 3 for the loop to execute again. If `p[i]` is not greater than `p[j]`, no changes are made to `p[i]`, `p[j]`, or `n`.***
