Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than its initial value and greater than 3. If the value at index `i` in the list `p` is greater than the value at index `j`, and if `a[i][j]` equals 1 and `a[j][i]` equals 1, then `p[i]` becomes equal to `p[j]`, while `p[j]` takes the value of `p[i]` before the operation.***
