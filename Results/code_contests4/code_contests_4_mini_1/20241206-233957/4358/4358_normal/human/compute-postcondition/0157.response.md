The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 5, so after execution, `j` becomes 6. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 5, `j` is 6, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 5, `j` is 6, `i` is 2**
