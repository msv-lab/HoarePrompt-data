The code attempts to assign the value of `tmp` to the `p` array at the index `j`. However, both `p` and `tmp` are undefined variables, which means this assignment cannot be completed successfully. The values of `n` and `j` do not affect the assignment and remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and notes the issue with the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1; `j` is 2; assignment cannot be completed due to undefined variables `p` and `tmp`.**
