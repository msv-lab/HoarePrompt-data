The code attempts to assign a value to `p[j]`, but `p` is not defined. This will result in an error because you cannot assign a value to an index of an undefined variable. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is an issue due to the undefined variable `p`. The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `j` is 4, `i` is 2; an error occurs due to `p` being undefined.**
