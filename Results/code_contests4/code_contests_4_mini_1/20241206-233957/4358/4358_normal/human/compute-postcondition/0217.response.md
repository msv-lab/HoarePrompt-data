`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so after execution, `j` will be 2 + 1, which is 3. The state of the other variables does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than the initial value of `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than the initial value of `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
