The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since it is stated that `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, after the assignment, `p[i]` will no longer be greater than `p[j]`, as `p[i]` will now take on the value of `p[j]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, and after conversion, `n` is greater than 1; `j` is 1; the value of `p[i]` is now equal to the value of `p[j]`; `a[i][j]` is equal to 1; `a[j][i]` is also equal to 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before the assignment.
