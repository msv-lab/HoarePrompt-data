Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, and if `a[i][j]` equals 1 and `a[j][i]` equals 1, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`, and `p[3]` is updated to hold the value of `p[1]`. If `p[i]` is not greater than `p[j]`, the values of `p` remain unchanged.***
