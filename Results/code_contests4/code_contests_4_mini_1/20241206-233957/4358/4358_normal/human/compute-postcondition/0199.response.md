The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `p[i]`, `p[j]`, `a[i][j]`, `a[j][i]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
