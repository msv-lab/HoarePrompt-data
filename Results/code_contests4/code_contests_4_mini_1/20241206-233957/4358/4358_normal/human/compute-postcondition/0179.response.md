The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `tmp` holds the original value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `tmp` holds the original value of `p[i]`**
