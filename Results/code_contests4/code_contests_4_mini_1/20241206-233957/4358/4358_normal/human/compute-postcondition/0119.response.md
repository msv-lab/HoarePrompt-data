The variable `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Given that `j` is 3 and `i` is 1, the value at index `j` (3) of the list `p` will be assigned to the index `i` (1) of the same list. The values of `n`, `j`, `p`, and `tmp` are not directly affected by this assignment, but the value at `p[1]` will change to the value currently at `p[3]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 3, `p` has its value at index 1 updated to the value at index 3, `i` is 1, and `tmp` remains unchanged as the value of `p[1]` before the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 3, `p` has its value at index 1 updated to the value at index 3, `i` is 1, and `tmp` remains unchanged.**
