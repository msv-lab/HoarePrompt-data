According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is equal to `n`, which means `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 (as `i` needs to be less than `n`). 

Therefore, we need to adjust the condition for `n` to ensure it is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, and potential swap conditions remain unchanged**.
