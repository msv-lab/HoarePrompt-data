The code attempts to assign the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`. However, `p` is undefined, which will cause an error during execution. As a result, no values of other variables change because the assignment does not occur. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `p` is undefined, causing an error in execution.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `p` is undefined, causing an error in execution.**
