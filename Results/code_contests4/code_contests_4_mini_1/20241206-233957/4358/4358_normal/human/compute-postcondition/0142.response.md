Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 3, `j` is 3, `i` is 2. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are 1, then `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, while `p[j]` remains unchanged. The original value of `p[i]` is stored in `tmp`, and `p[j]` is set to the value of `tmp`. If the condition is false, `p[i]` and `p[j]` remain unchanged.***
