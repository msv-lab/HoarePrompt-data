The code `a.append(b)` appends the list `b` to the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` is an empty list (`a` is `[]`), and `b` is a list that contains integers based on the string `s`, where each element is 1 if the corresponding character in `s` is '1' and 0 if it is '0'. The values of `n`, `p`, `A`, `__author__`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

After executing the code, `a` will now contain one element, which is the list `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` has been updated accordingly while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of string `s`, `a` is [b], `b` is a list containing integers where each element is 1 if the corresponding character in `s` is '1' and 0 if it is '0'.**
