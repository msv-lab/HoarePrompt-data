The statement `b.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `b`. Since `b` is currently an empty list, after executing this code, `b` will contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a` is now [[b], b], `b` is now [0].
