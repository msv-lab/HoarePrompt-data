The value of `j` is assigned the result of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `j` will be set to 1. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix filled with the binary representations of the input strings, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list containing `n` lists.
