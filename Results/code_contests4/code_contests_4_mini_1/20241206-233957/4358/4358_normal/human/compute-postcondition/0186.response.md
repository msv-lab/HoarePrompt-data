The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `tmp`, and the values in `p`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, and `tmp` holds the original value of `p[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, and `tmp` holds the original value of `p[0]**
