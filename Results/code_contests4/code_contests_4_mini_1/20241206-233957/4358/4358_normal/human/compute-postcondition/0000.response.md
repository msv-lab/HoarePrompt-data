Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`; `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix where for all integers `i`, `j` (1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `n`), `A[i][j]` = `A[j][i]` holds, and `A[i][i]` = 0 for all integers `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`); `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'.**
