Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than its initial value and greater than 3. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` and `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `tmp`, which is `p[i]`. If the condition does not hold, there are no changes to `p[j]` or `tmp`.***
