`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `j` is 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
