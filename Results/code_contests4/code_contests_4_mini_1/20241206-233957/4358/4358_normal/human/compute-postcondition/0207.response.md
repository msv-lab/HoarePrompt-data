According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. 

Since `j` is currently 4, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 4. The condition of `n` being a string representation of a number greater than 3 does not ensure that `n` is also greater than 4. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
