The code initializes `b` as an empty list. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables directly, but it changes the value of `b` to an empty list. 

The previous state of `b` is a sequence of integers, but after executing the code, `b` is now empty. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2; `p` is a map object of distinct integers; `A` is an n x n binary matrix; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `a` is now [[b], b]; `b` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2; `p` is a map object of distinct integers; `A` is an n x n binary matrix; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `a` is now [[b], b]; `b` is now an empty list.**
