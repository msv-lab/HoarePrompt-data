The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 1 to 2. The other variables `n`, `p`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1; `j` is 2; if `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` is set to 1, `a[j][i]` is also set to 1, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1; `j` is 2; if `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` is set to 1, `a[j][i]` is also set to 1, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.**
