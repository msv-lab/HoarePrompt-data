The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The values of `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `j` is 5, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `j` is 5, `i` is 2**
