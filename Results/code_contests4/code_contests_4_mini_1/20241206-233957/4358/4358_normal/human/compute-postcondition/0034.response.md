Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` is [b], `b` is now an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time then `len(s) > 0, and the character at index `j` of string `s` is '1'.***
