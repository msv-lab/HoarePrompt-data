According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is 1 and `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a numerical value greater than 1, since `j` is currently 1.

To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `n` must be converted from its string representation to an integer and this integer must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` needs to be converted to an integer greater than 1**
