Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 3, and the value at index `i` in the list `p` is greater than the value at index `j`. If `a[i][j]` equals 1 and `a[j][i]` equals 1, then `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]` after the operation, and `p[j]` takes the value of `p[i]` before the operation.***
