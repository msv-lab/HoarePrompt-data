The value of `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` of `p`, and since `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, `tmp` is equal to `p[j]`. Now, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which means `p[j]` remains unchanged. The states of all other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 2, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, `i` is 1, the value at index `i` of `a` is equal to 1, and the value at index `j` of `a` is also equal to 1; `tmp` is still equal to the value of `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 2, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, `i` is 1, the value at index `i` of `a` is equal to 1, the value at index `j` of `a` is also equal to 1; `tmp` is still equal to the value of `p[j]`**
