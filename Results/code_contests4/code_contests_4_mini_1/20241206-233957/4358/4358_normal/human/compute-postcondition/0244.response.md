`i` is assigned the value `0`, which overwrites its previous value of `n` (a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0). The values of `j`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 0; `j` is equal to `n`; `p` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 0; `j` is equal to `n`; `p` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged.**
