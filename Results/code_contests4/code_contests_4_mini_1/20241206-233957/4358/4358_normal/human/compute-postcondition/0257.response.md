The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. 

1. `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 300 \).
2. `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`.
3. `A` is an \( n \times n \) binary matrix with the properties: 
   - For all integers \( i, j \) where \( 1 \leq i < j \leq n \), \( A[i][j] = A[j][i] \) (symmetric).
   - \( A[i][i] = 0 \) for all integers \( i \) where \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the relationships defined by the inputs. However, the specific output based on these parameters is not detailed here.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a list `p` of `n` distinct integers, and an \( n \times n \) binary matrix `A`, and performs operations based on these inputs, returning a specific result.**
