The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. After execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `j`, and `p`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, and `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, and `p` remains unchanged.**
