The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `b` remains unchanged as it is not explicitly affected.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `b` remains unchanged.**
