`p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The initial state indicates that `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, which means after the assignment, `p[i]` will now hold the same value as `p[j]`. Therefore, `p[i]` will no longer be greater than `p[j]`, and the value of `p[j]` is unchanged. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 3, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, `p[j]` remains unchanged, `tmp` is assigned the original value of `p[i]`.**
