The code attempts to assign a value to `p[j]`, but `p` is undefined, which will cause an error in execution. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the program does not proceed further due to the error.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and an error occurs due to `p` being undefined.**
