Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `len(s)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. If `s[j]` is '1', then `a` is updated to [b with an appended value 1]. Otherwise, `a` is updated to [b, 0], where `b` contains 0 appended to it.***
