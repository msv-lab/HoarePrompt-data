The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 4, so after execution, `j` will be 5. The values of the other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 5.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 5**
