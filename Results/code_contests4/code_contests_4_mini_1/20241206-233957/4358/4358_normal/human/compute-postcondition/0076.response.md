The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 3, `j` is equal to the length of `s`, `a` is now [[b], b, b], `b` contains a binary representation of the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 3, `j` is equal to the length of `s`, `a` is now [[b], b, b], `b` contains a binary representation of the string `s`.**
