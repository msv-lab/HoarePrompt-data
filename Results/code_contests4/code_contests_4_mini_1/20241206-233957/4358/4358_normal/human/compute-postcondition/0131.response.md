Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, and `p` remains unchanged unless the conditions `p[i] > p[j]` and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` being equal to 1 are satisfied, in which case `p[1]` would be updated to `p[j]` and `p[j]` would be updated to `tmp`.**
