The code attempts to assign a value to `tmp` from the list `p` using the index `i`. However, the initial state does not define the variable `p`, so we cannot determine the value of `tmp`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `p` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `p` is undefined.**
