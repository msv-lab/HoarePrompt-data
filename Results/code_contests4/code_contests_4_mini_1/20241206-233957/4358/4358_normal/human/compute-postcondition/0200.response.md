According to the code, the loop execution depends on the relationship between `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 3 (since `j` is currently 3). Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
