The `p` variable is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes an input string from `raw_input()`, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a string representation of the input value, and `p` will now hold a map object containing the integer representations of the split input values. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the input value; `p` is a map object of distinct integers; `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'**
