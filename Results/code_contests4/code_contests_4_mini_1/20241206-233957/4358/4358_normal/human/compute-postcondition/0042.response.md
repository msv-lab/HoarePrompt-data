The code `b.append(0)` appends the integer 0 to the list `b`. The variable `b` is currently an element of the list `a`, which means the change will affect `a` as well since `a` references `b`. The initial values of other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `a` is [b, 0], and `b` now contains the integer 0 appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `a` is [b, 0], `b` contains 0 appended to it.**
