The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is known to be 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `j`, `p`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n`, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n`, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, and `a` remains unchanged.**
