The code `b.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `b`. Since `b` is currently an empty list, after execution, `b` will contain the element `1`. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `A`, `__author__`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a` is now [[b], b], `b` is now [1], `s` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a` is now [[b], b], `b` is now [1], `s` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `s` is '1'**.
