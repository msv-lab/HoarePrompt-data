Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 3, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, and if `a[i][j]` is 1 and `a[j][i]` is 1, then `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, while `p[j]` remains unchanged. The value of `tmp` is assigned to the original value of `p[i]`, and `p[j]` is set to the value of `tmp`, which is equal to its original value. Otherwise, if the condition is false, no changes are made to `p[i]` or `p[j]`.***
