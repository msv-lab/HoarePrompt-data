The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The values of `j`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is a string representation of a number greater than its initial value, `p` and `a` are unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `n` is a string representation of a number greater than its initial value, `p` and `a` are unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.**
