The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. The Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than the initial value of `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than the initial value of `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`**
