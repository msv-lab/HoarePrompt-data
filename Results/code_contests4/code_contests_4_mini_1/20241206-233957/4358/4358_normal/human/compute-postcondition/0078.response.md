The value of `i` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `i` was equal to `n`, which is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `i` is now 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than or equal to 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix filled with the binary representations of the input strings, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of the last string `s`, `a` is a list containing `n` lists.**
