The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `len(s)`, `a` is now [[b], b], and `b` contains a sequence of integers (0s and 1s).**
