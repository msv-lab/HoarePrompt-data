The code attempts to assign a value to `p[j]`, but `p` is undefined, which leads to an error in execution. The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, and since there is an error, no further calculations or assignments can take place. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 5, `j` is 5, `i` is 2, and an error occurs due to undefined variable `p`.**
