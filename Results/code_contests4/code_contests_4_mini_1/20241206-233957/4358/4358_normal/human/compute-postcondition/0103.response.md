The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 3 to 4. The other variables `n`, `p`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `j` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `j` is 4**
