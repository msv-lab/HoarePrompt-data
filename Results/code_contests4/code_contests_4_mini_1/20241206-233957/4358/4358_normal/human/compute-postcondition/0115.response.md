Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `j` is 2, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is 1. If the value at index `i` of `p` is greater than the value at index `j` of `p` and if `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, then `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, and `tmp` remains equal to the value of `p[j]`.***
