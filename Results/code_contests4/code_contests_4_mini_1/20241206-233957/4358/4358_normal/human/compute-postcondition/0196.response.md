The variable `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `tmp`, meaning that the output state will reflect that `p[j]` is now assigned an unknown value, while `n`, `i`, `j`, `p[i]`, `p[j]`, `a[i][j]`, and `a[j][i]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, and `p[j]` is now assigned the value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, and `p[j]` is now assigned the value of `tmp`.**
