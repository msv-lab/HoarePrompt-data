The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before the assignment. The code then assigns the value of `tmp` to `p[j]`. Since `p[i]` and `p[j]` were previously equal, after this operation, `p[j]` retains its value, and `p[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1; `j` is 1; `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`; `a[i][j]` is equal to 1; `a[j][i]` is also equal to 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0 and greater than 1; `j` is 1; `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`; `a[i][j]` is equal to 1; `a[j][i]` is also equal to 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.**
