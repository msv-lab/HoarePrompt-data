Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 2, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a` is now [[b], b], and `s` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j` of `s` is '1', then `b` is now [1]. Otherwise, if the character at index `j` of `s` is not '1', then `b` is now [0].***
