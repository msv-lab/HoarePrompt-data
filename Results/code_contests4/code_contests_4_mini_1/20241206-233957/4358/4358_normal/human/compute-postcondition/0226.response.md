The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `a`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than its initial value and greater than 3; `j` is increased by 1; `p` and `a` are unchanged.**
