The value of `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which was previously assigned the original value of `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, this means that `p[j]` will be updated to the same value that it already had. Therefore, the states of `n`, `j`, `i`, `p[i]`, and `p[j]` do not change as a result of this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 3, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`, `p[j]` remains unchanged, `tmp` is assigned the original value of `p[i]`, and `p[j]` is set to the value of `tmp`, which is equal to its original value.**
