The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a string representation of a number greater than its initial value and greater than 3, but it does not provide information about `p` or `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific values of `tmp`, `p`, or `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than its initial value and greater than 3; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, but the specific value is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than its initial value and greater than 3; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, but the specific value is unknown.**
