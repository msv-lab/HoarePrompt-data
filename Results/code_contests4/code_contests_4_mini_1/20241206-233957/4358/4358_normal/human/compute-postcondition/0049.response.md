The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a number greater than 1, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an n x n binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
