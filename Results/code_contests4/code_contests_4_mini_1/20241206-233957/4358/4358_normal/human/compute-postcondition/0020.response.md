`j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a number greater than 0, `p` is a map object of distinct integers, `A` is an `n` x `n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `a` is [].
