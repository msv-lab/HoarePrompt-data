The function accepts an integer `n`, a list `p` of `n` distinct integers, and an \( n \times n \) binary matrix. It processes these inputs to swap elements in `p` based on conditions defined by the binary matrix `A`. The result is a space-separated string of the integers in `p` after the potential swaps are performed. Note that the function does not handle invalid inputs or cases where `n` is not properly defined, which may lead to incorrect behavior.
