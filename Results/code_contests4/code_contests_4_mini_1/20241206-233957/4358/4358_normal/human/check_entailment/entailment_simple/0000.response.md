The provided program attempts to find the prettiest permutation of a given permutation `p` based on a binary matrix `A` that indicates which elements can be swapped. However, the implementation does not correctly follow the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Improper Input Handling**: 
   - The `input()` function captures input as a string, and while converting `p` to a list of integers, it uses `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which is an incorrect usage in Python 3 (it should be `input()` instead of `raw_input()`). This would lead to a `NameError` if run in Python 3.

2. **Incorrect Swap Logic**: 
   - The program attempts to sort the permutation by comparing elements and checking if they can be swapped based on the adjacency matrix `A`. However, it does not effectively use the connectivity given by `A` to determine which elements can ultimately reach each other. The current logic only checks one swap at a time without considering the entire connectivity component defined by the matrix `A`.

3. **Redundant Sorting Logic**:
   - The program has the same nested loop repeated three times for swaps, which is unnecessary. Even if the swapping logic were correct, repeating it multiple times does not contribute to solving the problem in a more efficient manner.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output is a string `s` which is built up with elements of `p`, but it does not remove the trailing space. This can lead to formatting issues when outputting.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the prettiest permutation as defined in the problem description. The necessary checks for the connectivity of elements based on the matrix `A` are missing, and the implementation of swaps does not reflect the complete set of possible swaps allowed by the matrix.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
