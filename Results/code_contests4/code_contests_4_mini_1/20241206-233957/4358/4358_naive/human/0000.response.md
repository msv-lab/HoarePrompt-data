To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided Python code and see if it adheres to the requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: 
   - An integer `n` representing the size of the permutation.
   - A list of integers forming the permutation `p`.
   - An `n x n` binary matrix `A` where `A[i][j] = 1` allows swapping elements `p[i]` and `p[j]`.

2. **Output**: 
   - A prettiest permutation of `p` that can be obtained by allowed swaps.

3. **Prettiest Permutation**: 
   - A permutation is prettier if there exists an index `k` such that the first `k-1` elements are the same in both permutations but `ak < bk`.

### Code Analysis:
- The program reads inputs correctly, storing the permutation and the adjacency matrix.
- It attempts to sort the permutation `p` by checking every possible pair for swapping.
- However, the sorting logic is flawed:
  - The swappings are conditionally based on the adjacency matrix, but they do not ensure that every reachable element can be swapped into its correct position. 
  - The code tries to swap elements multiple times without ensuring that the adjacency conditions are fully respected, which may lead to not achieving the prettiest permutation.

### Potential Cases Where It Fails:
- Consider a case where the adjacency matrix does not allow certain swaps but the initial permutation is already not the prettiest:
  ```
  Input:
  4
  4 3 2 1
  0000
  0000
  0000
  0000
  ```
  Here, no swaps are allowed since all entries in the adjacency matrix `A` are `0`. The output should remain `4 3 2 1`, but the prettiest permutation is `1 2 3 4`, which cannot be achieved due to the lack of allowed swaps. Therefore, the expected output is not produced.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic for swapping and the failure to achieve the prettiest permutation under certain conditions, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
