Correctness: **False**.

The program only checks for the exact combinations of the syllable counts (5, 5, 7) and its permutations explicitly listed in the conditions. However, it fails to account for other valid permutations that could be formed with the numbers 5, 7, and any additional valid number that could be between 1 and 10.

For instance, the input `7 5 5` is not checked by the current conditions, and thus the program would incorrectly output `NO` when it should output `YES`. 

The code needs to verify whether any permutation of the inputs matches the required syllable counts of 5, 7, and 5. The current implementation lacks a general case to handle all valid arrangements of A, B, and C effectively.
