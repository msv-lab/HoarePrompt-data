Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem states that a Haiku can be constructed if the phrases have syllable counts of 5, 7, and 5 in any order. However, the program only checks for three specific arrangements of the syllable counts (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), and (7, 5, 5). 

There are other valid combinations that would also satisfy the Haiku requirements. For instance:
- If the input is (6, 5, 4), the program would output "NO", but this case satisfies the syllable requirement of 5, 7, and 5, and thus should return "YES" if any of the numbers were adjusted to fit the requirement.
- The program fails to generalize for any combination of inputs that could potentially match the Haiku form.

Therefore, the program does not cover all possible valid cases and does not meet the problem description's requirements comprehensively. It is limited to a specific set of conditions that do not account for all valid permutations of the syllable counts.
