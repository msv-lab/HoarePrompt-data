You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Iroha loves Haiku. Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables, in this order.

To create a Haiku, Iroha has come up with three different phrases. These phrases have A, B and C syllables, respectively. Determine whether she can construct a Haiku by using each of the phrases once, in some order.

Constraints

* 1≦A,B,C≦10

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


A B C


Output

If it is possible to construct a Haiku by using each of the phrases once, print `YES` (case-sensitive). Otherwise, print `NO`.

Examples

Input

5 5 7


Output

YES


Input

7 7 5


Output

NO
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10.
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if (a == 5 and b == 5 and c == 7) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (a == 5 and b == 7 and c == 5) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            if (a == 7 and b == 5 and c == 5) :
                print('YES')
            else :
                print('NO')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 10. If `a` is equal to 7, `b` is equal to 5, and `c` is equal to 5, then "YES" is printed. Otherwise, "NO" is printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 10. If `a` is 5, `b` is 7, and `c` is 5, then the output is 'YES'. If `a` is equal to 7, `b` is equal to 5, and `c` is equal to 5, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 10. If `a` is 5, `b` is 5, and `c` is 7, then 'YES' is printed. If `a` is 5, `b` is 7, and `c` is 5, then 'YES' is printed. If `a` is 7, `b` is 5, and `c` is 5, then 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, entered by the user. It checks if the integers match the specific combinations of (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), or (7, 5, 5) and prints 'YES' if any of these combinations are met. If none of the combinations match, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and can handle inputs within the range of 1 to 10 for each integer.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
