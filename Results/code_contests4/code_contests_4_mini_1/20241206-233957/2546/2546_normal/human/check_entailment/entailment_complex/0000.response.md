The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description.

**Explanation of the Issues:**

1. **Combinatorial Check:**
   The problem description states that a Haiku can be formed if the three phrases can be arranged to have 5, 7, and 5 syllables. This means the program should check for all permutations of (5, 7, 5) rather than just the specific combinations (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), and (7, 5, 5). For example, the input (7, 5, 5) should correctly output "YES" since it can be rearranged to (5, 7, 5), but this is already handled by the existing checks.

2. **Missing Valid Combinations:**
   The program currently checks for a limited set of combinations and does not account for any other arrangements. For example, if the input is (5, 5, 7), it returns "YES" correctly, but if the input is (5, 7, 5), it also returns "YES". However, if the input is (7, 5, 5), it also returns "YES", which is the only valid combination it checks explicitly. 

3. **Inefficiency:**
   The function checks each combination separately. A more efficient solution would simply check if the sorted values of the input match the sorted values of (5, 5, 7).

Given these issues, the program does not cover all the necessary combinations for a Haiku, and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
