Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 10; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input values. It is not the case that `a` is 5, `b` is 7, and `c` is 5. Therefore, at least one of the following holds: `a` is not equal to 5, or `b` is not equal to 7, or `c` is not equal to 5. Additionally, `a` is not equal to 5 or `b` is not equal to 7 or `c` is not equal to 5.***
