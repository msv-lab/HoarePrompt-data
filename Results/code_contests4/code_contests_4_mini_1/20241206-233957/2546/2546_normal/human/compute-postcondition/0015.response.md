Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, entered by the user. It checks if the integers match the specific combinations of (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), or (7, 5, 5) and prints 'YES' if any of these combinations are met. If none of the combinations match, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and can handle inputs within the range of 1 to 10 for each integer. **
