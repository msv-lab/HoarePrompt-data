Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 10. If `a` is 5, `b` is 5, and `c` is 7, then 'YES' is printed. If `a` is 5, `b` is 7, and `c` is 5, then 'YES' is printed. If `a` is 7, `b` is 5, and `c` is 5, then 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, 'NO' is printed.***
