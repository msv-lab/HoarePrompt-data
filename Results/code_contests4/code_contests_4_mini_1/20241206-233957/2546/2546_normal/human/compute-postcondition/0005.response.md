The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `A`, `B`, `C`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged and are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 10; `a` is 5, `b` is 7, `c` is 5; print output is 'YES'.**
