The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers that are expected to be within the range of 1 to 10. However, since the function does not take any parameters, it does not directly utilize `A`, `B`, or `C` as inputs. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value or the conditions under which it returns specific outputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
