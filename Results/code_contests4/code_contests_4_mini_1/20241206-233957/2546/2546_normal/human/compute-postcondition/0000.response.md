The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input received through `raw_input()`, which is split into three parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not directly affected but represent the potential values that `a`, `b`, and `c` can take, as they are within the range of 1 to 10. Therefore, after executing the code, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold integer values based on the input provided.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 10; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input values.**
