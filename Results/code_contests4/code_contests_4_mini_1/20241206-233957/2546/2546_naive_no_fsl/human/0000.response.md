Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for constructing a Haiku. Specifically, it only checks for three hardcoded arrangements of the syllable counts (5, 5, 7) and its permutations. However, it does not account for all possible combinations of A, B, and C that could satisfy the Haiku requirements.

For example, the input `5 7 5` should also yield "YES", as it can form a Haiku with 5 syllables (first phrase), 7 syllables (second phrase), and 5 syllables (third phrase). However, this input is not covered by any of the conditional checks in the code.

Thus, there are valid combinations that the program overlooks, making it incorrect.
