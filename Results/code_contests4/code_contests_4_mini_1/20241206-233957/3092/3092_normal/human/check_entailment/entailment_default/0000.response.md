The provided program attempts to solve the problem of ensuring all substrings of a given string `s` are distinct by counting the number of changes needed to achieve that. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program checks if the length of the string `n` is less than or equal to 26 (the number of unique lowercase English letters). 
2. If `n` is greater than 26, the program immediately returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make all substrings distinct since there are not enough unique characters to make changes.
3. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the program calculates the number of changes needed by subtracting the number of unique characters in `s` from `n`. This is based on the assumption that the number of duplicate characters will dictate how many changes are needed.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `n` is 26 and all characters in `s` are unique, the output should be `0` since all substrings would already be distinct.
2. If `n` is 26 and there are duplicates, it should count the number of changes needed correctly.
3. The program does not consider cases where there are more than 26 characters in the string `s`. Since there can be up to `n` characters but only 26 unique lowercase letters, if `n > 26`, it should return `-1`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function calculates the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s` when `n` is less than or equal to 26, and returns `-1` otherwise. 

The hints align with the code, so the output hints confirm that the implementation matches the logic described in the problem statement. 

### Conclusion:
While the program provides a solution for strings of length `n <= 26`, it does not handle cases involving multiple occurrences of the same substring correctly for larger strings. For example:
- If `s = "aabbcc"`, with `n = 6`, the program would return `0` (since there are 3 unique characters), which is incorrect since multiple substrings would still be the same (e.g., "aa", "bb", "cc", etc.).

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
