The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Understanding of Distinct Substrings**:
   The problem requires determining the minimum number of changes needed to ensure all substrings of the string `s` are distinct. This means that the program must identify cases where duplicate substrings exist and count how many changes are necessary to eliminate these duplicates.

2. **Handling of Input Length**:
   The program checks if `n` (the length of the string) is less than or equal to 26. If it is, it computes `result` as `n - len(set(s))`, which gives the number of characters in `s` that are not unique. This is a step towards addressing the problem, but it does not fully solve it. If `s` has all unique characters, then no changes are necessary, which is correctly identified.

3. **Incorrect Handling for `n > 26`**:
   If `n` is greater than 26, the program sets `result` to `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make all substrings distinct. This logic is flawed because the problem does not state that having more than 26 characters makes it impossible to achieve distinct substrings. It simply states that characters can be changed. The program fails to consider that one can always change characters to ensure all substrings are unique, regardless of the length of the string.

4. **Missing Logic for Actual Changes**:
   The program does not evaluate how many changes are needed if `n` is less than or equal to 26. The calculation `n - len(set(s))` does not accurately reflect the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct; it only reflects the number of duplicates in terms of character frequency.

5. **Conclusion**:
   The program does not handle all scenarios appropriately, particularly when `n > 26`, and does not correctly compute the minimum number of changes required. It does not fully solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
