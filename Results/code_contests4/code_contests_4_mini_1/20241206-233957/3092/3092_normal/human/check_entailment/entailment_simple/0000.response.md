The given program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Unique Characters**: The program assumes that if the length of the string `s` is less than or equal to 26, it can simply calculate the number of changes needed by subtracting the number of unique characters from `n`. This is incorrect because even if the string has a unique character count less than 26, it does not guarantee that all substrings will be distinct. For example, the string "aabb" has unique characters but has many repeating substrings.

2. **Incorrect Output for Length Greater than 26**: The program immediately returns -1 for any string longer than 26 characters without checking if it is possible to create distinct substrings. While it is true that if `n > 26`, at least one substring will have to repeat (since there are only 26 lowercase letters), the program does not assess how many changes might be necessary to achieve distinct substrings, nor does it provide a valid mechanism to determine if it is possible.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Logic**: The program lacks logic to systematically count and replace characters in `s` to ensure all substrings are distinct. It oversimplifies the problem and fails to explore the necessary conditions to achieve distinct substrings.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases. 

Correctness: **False**
