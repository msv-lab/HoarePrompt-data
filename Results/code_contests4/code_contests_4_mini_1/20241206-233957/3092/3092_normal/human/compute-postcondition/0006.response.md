The variable `result` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables, `n` and `s`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters; `result` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters; `result` is -1**.
