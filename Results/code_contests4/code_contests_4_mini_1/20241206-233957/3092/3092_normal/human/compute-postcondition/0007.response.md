Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `result` is calculated as `n - len(set(s))`, which represents the difference between the length of `s` and the number of unique characters in `s`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, `result` is set to -1.***
