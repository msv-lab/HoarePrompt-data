The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. Here, `n` is an integer that falls within the range of 1 to 100,000, and `s` is a string composed of lowercase English letters with a length equal to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on them. However, the specific output or processing logic has not been provided, so we cannot detail the return values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and a string parameter `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters.**
