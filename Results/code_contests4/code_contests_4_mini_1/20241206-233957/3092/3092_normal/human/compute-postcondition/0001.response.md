The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but it is specified that `n` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. The variable `s` is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters.**
