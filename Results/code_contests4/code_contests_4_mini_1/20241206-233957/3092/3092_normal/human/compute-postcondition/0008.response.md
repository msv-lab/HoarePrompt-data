Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters, we have two scenarios based on the value of `n`:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `result` would be calculated as `n - len(set(s))`, which represents the difference between the length of `s` and the number of unique characters in `s`.
2. If `n` is greater than 26, `result` would be set to -1.

The code provided is `print(str(result))`, which outputs the value of `result` as a string. 

Since the exact values for `n` and `s` are not given in the initial state, the output state will depend on those conditions. Therefore, the output state can be summarized based on the two possible conditions:

Output State: **If `n` ≤ 26, `result` is calculated as `n - len(set(s))`; If `n` > 26, `result` is -1.**
