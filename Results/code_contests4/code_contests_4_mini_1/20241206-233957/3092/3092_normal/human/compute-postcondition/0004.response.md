The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - len(set(s))`. Here, `set(s)` creates a set of unique characters from the string `s`, and `len(set(s))` calculates the number of unique characters in `s`. 

Since `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100000, and we know that `n` is less than or equal to 26, the resulting value of `len(set(s))` can range from 1 to 26 based on the unique characters in the string `s`. 

Thus, `result` will be calculated as follows: 
- If all characters in `s` are unique, `result` will be `n - len(set(s))`, which will be `n - n = 0`.
- If there are some repeated characters in `s`, `result` will be a positive integer, specifically `n - k`, where `k` is the number of unique characters.

Therefore, taking into account the initial conditions and the assignment to `result`, the output state can be expressed as:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters; `result` is `n - len(set(s))`.**
