The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates and prints the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s`. If `n` is greater than 26, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly to the output.
