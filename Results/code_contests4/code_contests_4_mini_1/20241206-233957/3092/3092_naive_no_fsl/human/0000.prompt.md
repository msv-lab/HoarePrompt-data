You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A wise man told Kerem "Different is good" once, so Kerem wants all things in his life to be different. 

Kerem recently got a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Since Kerem likes it when things are different, he wants all substrings of his string s to be distinct. Substring is a string formed by some number of consecutive characters of the string. For example, string "aba" has substrings "" (empty substring), "a", "b", "a", "ab", "ba", "aba".

If string s has at least two equal substrings then Kerem will change characters at some positions to some other lowercase English letters. Changing characters is a very tiring job, so Kerem want to perform as few changes as possible.

Your task is to find the minimum number of changes needed to make all the substrings of the given string distinct, or determine that it is impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of the string s.

The second line contains the string s of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Output

If it's impossible to change the string s such that all its substring are distinct print -1. Otherwise print the minimum required number of changes.

Examples

Input

2
aa


Output

1


Input

4
koko


Output

2


Input

5
murat


Output

0

Note

In the first sample one of the possible solutions is to change the first character to 'b'.

In the second sample, one may change the first character to 'a' and second character to 'b', so the string becomes "abko".
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = raw_input()
    if n <= 26:
        result = n - len(set(s))
    else:
        result = -1
    print(str(result))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
