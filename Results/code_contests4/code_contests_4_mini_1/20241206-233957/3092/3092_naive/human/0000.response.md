To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program logic.

**Problem Description Recap:**
1. We need to ensure all substrings of a given string `s` are distinct.
2. We can change some characters in the string to achieve this.
3. We need to find the minimum number of changes required or determine if it's impossible.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The program starts by reading the integer `n` which represents the length of the string `s`.
2. It then reads the string `s`.
3. If `n` is less than or equal to 26 (the number of distinct lowercase English letters), it calculates the number of changes required by subtracting the size of the set of characters in `s` from `n`.
4. If `n` exceeds 26, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make all substrings distinct since there aren't enough distinct characters available.

**Potential Cases:**
1. For strings of length greater than 26, the program correctly identifies that it's impossible to make all substrings distinct and returns `-1`.
2. For strings of length less than or equal to 26, the program calculates the required changes based on the count of distinct characters.

**Testing Validity with Examples:**
- For `n = 2` and `s = "aa"`, the result should be `1`, as changing one 'a' to any other character (e.g., 'b') would make the substrings distinct.
- For `n = 4` and `s = "koko"`, the result should be `2`, as changing two characters (both 'k' and 'o' can be changed, for example) will help achieve distinctness.
- For `n = 5` and `s = "murat"`, the result should be `0` since all characters are distinct.

**Counterexample to Consider:**
The program fails to handle cases where the distinct character count is equal to `n` but still has repeating substrings. For example:
- If `n = 6` and `s = "abcabc"`, the number of distinct characters is 3, but multiple substrings like "abc", "ab", "bc" repeat. The program would return `3` (6 - 3) but does not take into account that even with 3 distinct characters, not all substrings can be made distinct.

Thus, this logic does not fully address the problem requirements, as it doesn't consider the implications of substring repetitions within the character limitations.

Correctness: **False**.
