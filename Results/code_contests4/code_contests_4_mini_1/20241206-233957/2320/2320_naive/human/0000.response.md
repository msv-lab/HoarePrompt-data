To evaluate the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Vanya can walk in an `n x n` field filled with `m` apple trees located at given coordinates.
2. Vanya moves in a direction defined by the vector `(dx, dy)`.
3. The program needs to determine the starting coordinates to maximize the number of apple trees Vanya can encounter before returning to a previously visited cell.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    (g, tmp_x, tmp_y) = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
    return (g, x, y)

(n, m, dx, dy) = map(int, raw_input().split())
count = [0] * n
for i in range(0, m):
    (x, y) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (g, t, k) = func_1(n, dy)
    k = -k * y
    rep_x = ((x + k * dx) % n + n) % n
    count[rep_x] = count[rep_x] + 1

ans_x = 0
for x in range(0, n):
    if count[x] > count[ans_x]:
        ans_x = x
print(ans_x, 0)
```

### Key Observations:
1. The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and uses it for calculations related to Vanya's movement.
2. The program initializes a count array to track the number of apple trees Vanya can encounter from each starting position.
3. It reads the apple tree coordinates and calculates a representative x-coordinate for each tree based on its starting position and the movement vector.

### Potential Issues:
1. The handling of the coordinates in the `rep_x` calculation may not accurately reflect all paths Vanya can take based on the movement vector.
2. The output only returns `ans_x` and `0`, which implies that it assumes all starting positions can only have a y-coordinate of `0`. However, the problem description does not restrict the starting y-coordinate in any way.

### Test Case:
Consider a case where:
- `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `dx = 1`, `dy = 1`
- Apple tree coordinates: `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`

Expected behavior:
- From `(0, 0)`, Vanya can move to `(1, 1)` and then back to `(0, 0)`.
- Starting from `(1, 1)`, Vanya can move to `(2, 2)` (which wraps around to `(0, 0)` and then back to `(1, 1)`).

However, the program may not correctly account for the count of apple trees based on y-coordinates since it always outputs `0` as the second coordinate.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fully adhere to the problem's requirements because it restricts the output's y-coordinate to `0`, which is not specified in the problem. As a result, it may not return the optimal starting cell for all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
