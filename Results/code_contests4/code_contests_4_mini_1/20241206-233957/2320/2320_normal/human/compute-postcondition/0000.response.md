Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers representing the size of the field (n), the number of apple trees (m), and the movement vector (dx, dy) such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n; `b` is equal to 0; followed by m pairs of integers (xi, yi) representing the coordinates of the apple trees with 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1.***
