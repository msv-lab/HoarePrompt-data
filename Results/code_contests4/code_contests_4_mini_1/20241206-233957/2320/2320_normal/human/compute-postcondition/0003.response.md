To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet.

The code `g, tmp_x, tmp_y = func_1(b, a % b)` calls a function `func_1` with the arguments `b` and `a % b`. The output of this function is expected to return three values which are assigned to `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y`.

Since we don't have the specific implementation of `func_1`, but we know that `b` is greater than 0 and that `a` and `b` are integers, we can infer the following:

1. The expression `a % b` calculates the remainder of `a` when divided by `b`, resulting in a value that must be in the range of `0` to `b-1`.
2. The function `func_1` will process these two values (`b` and `a % b`) and will yield three outputs: `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y`.

However, without specific details on what `func_1` does, we cannot determine the exact values of `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y`. Therefore, we can only state the relationship of the variables involved after execution.

Output State: **`g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` are assigned values from `func_1(b, a % b)`; `b` is greater than 0; `a % b` is in the range of `0` to `b-1`.**
