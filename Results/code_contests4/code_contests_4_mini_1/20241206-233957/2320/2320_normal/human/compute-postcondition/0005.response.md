The value of `y` is assigned the result of the expression `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`. The values of `tmp_x` and `tmp_y` are affected by the function `func_1(b, a % b)`, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Given that `b` is greater than 0, the division `a / b` is valid, and the result will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b`. 

Since `tmp_x` and `tmp_y` are derived from the function call and their exact values are unknown, we can express `y` in terms of these variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `y` based on the provided variables.

Output State: **`g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` are assigned values from `func_1(b, a % b)`, `b` is greater than 0, `a % b` is in the range of `0` to `b-1`; `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`; `y` is calculated as `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`**.
