The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the size of the field (n), the number of apple trees (m), and the movement vector (dx, dy) under the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n. 

After executing the function body, the output varies based on the following cases:
- Case 1: If certain conditions are met, the function returns the integer `a`, followed by the integers 1 and 0.
- Case 2: If the conditions for Case 1 are not met, the function returns the values of `g`, `x` (which is assigned the value of `tmp_y`), and `y` (calculated as `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and based on specific conditions, it returns either a set of integers or a combination of calculated values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns either the integer `a` followed by 1 and 0, or returns the values of `g`, `x`, and `y` based on certain conditions.**
