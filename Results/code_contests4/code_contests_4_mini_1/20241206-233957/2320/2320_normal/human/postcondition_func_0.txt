The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a`, 1, and 0. If `b` is greater than 0, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and then calculates values `x` and `y` based on the results of that call. The final return values are `g`, `x`, and `y`, where `g` is the result of the recursive call, `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`, and `y` is calculated as `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`. The function effectively implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, returning the greatest common divisor and coefficients for expressing it as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.
