You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vanya decided to walk in the field of size n × n cells. The field contains m apple trees, the i-th apple tree is at the cell with coordinates (xi, yi). Vanya moves towards vector (dx, dy). That means that if Vanya is now at the cell (x, y), then in a second he will be at cell <image>. The following condition is satisfied for the vector: <image>, where <image> is the largest integer that divides both a and b. Vanya ends his path when he reaches the square he has already visited. 

Vanya wonders, from what square of the field he should start his path to see as many apple trees as possible.

Input

The first line contains integers n, m, dx, dy(1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n) — the size of the field, the number of apple trees and the vector of Vanya's movement. Next m lines contain integers xi, yi (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1) — the coordinates of apples. One cell may contain multiple apple trees.

Output

Print two space-separated numbers — the coordinates of the cell from which you should start your path. If there are several answers you are allowed to print any of them.

Examples

Input

5 5 2 3
0 0
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 1


Output

1 3


Input

2 3 1 1
0 0
0 1
1 1


Output

0 0

Note

In the first sample Vanya's path will look like: (1, 3) - (3, 1) - (0, 4) - (2, 2) - (4, 0) - (1, 3)

In the second sample: (0, 0) - (1, 1) - (0, 0)
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the size of the field (n), the number of apple trees (m), and the movement vector (dx, dy) such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n; followed by m pairs of integers (xi, yi) representing the coordinates of the apple trees with 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return a, 1, 0
        #The program returns the integer 'a', followed by the integers 1 and 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are integers representing the size of the field (n), the number of apple trees (m), and the movement vector (dx, dy) such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n; followed by m pairs of integers (xi, yi) representing the coordinates of the apple trees with 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1. The value of `b` is greater than 0.
    g, tmp_x, tmp_y = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
    return g, x, y
    #The program returns the values of g, x (which is assigned the value of tmp_y), and y (calculated as tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a`, 1, and 0. If `b` is greater than 0, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and then calculates values `x` and `y` based on the results of that call. The final return values are `g`, `x`, and `y`, where `g` is the result of the recursive call, `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`, and `y` is calculated as `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`. The function effectively implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, returning the greatest common divisor and coefficients for expressing it as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
