Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem describes a scenario where Vanya needs to determine the best starting cell in a grid (field) to collect as many apple trees as possible while moving in a specified direction. The output should be the coordinates of this starting cell.

However, the provided function `func_1(a, b)` is an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and their coefficients in a linear combination. This function does not address the problem of finding a starting cell in the grid from which Vanya can collect the maximum number of apple trees. 

Specifically, the following aspects demonstrate the program's failure to meet the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function only computes the GCD and does not consider the grid, the apple tree positions, or Vanya's movement. It doesn't implement any logic to evaluate the cells in the grid or to track which cells have been visited.

2. **Output Requirements**: The problem requires the identification of a specific starting position (coordinates) that maximizes the number of apple trees visited. This is not addressed anywhere in the provided code.

3. **Input Handling**: The program doesnâ€™t accept or process the input values for the field size, number of apple trees, or their coordinates. It simply works with two integer inputs, which do not represent the actual problem as described.

In conclusion, since the program does not align with the problem description and fails to implement the necessary logic to solve the problem, it is incorrect.
