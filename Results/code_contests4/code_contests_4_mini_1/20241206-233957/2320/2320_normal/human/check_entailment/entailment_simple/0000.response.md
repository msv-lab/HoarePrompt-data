Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the functionality described in the problem statement. 

Here are the key reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` appears to be a helper function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the problem description requires a function that determines the optimal starting coordinates for Vanya's walk to maximize the number of apple trees visited. The program does not address this requirement.

2. **Input Handling**: The function does not take in the required parameters as specified in the problem (i.e., the field size `n`, the number of trees `m`, the movement vector `(dx, dy)`, and the coordinates of the apple trees). Instead, it operates only on two parameters `a` and `b`, which do not correspond to the problem's input structure.

3. **Output**: The function only returns three integers, which do not represent the coordinates of the optimal starting cell for Vanya as required by the problem statement. The output format specified in the problem is two space-separated numbers, but this program does not comply with that requirement.

4. **Logic Implementation**: There is no logic in the provided function that simulates Vanya's movement through the grid or counts the number of apple trees encountered during his walk, which is a crucial part of the problem.

In summary, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description, as it fails to implement the necessary logic to determine the optimal starting position for Vanya to maximize the number of apple trees he visits. Thus, the correctness of the program is false.
