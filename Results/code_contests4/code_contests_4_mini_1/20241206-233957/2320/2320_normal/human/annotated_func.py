#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the size of the field (n), the number of apple trees (m), and the movement vector (dx, dy) such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n; followed by m pairs of integers (xi, yi) representing the coordinates of the apple trees with 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return a, 1, 0
        #The program returns the integer 'a', followed by the integers 1 and 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are integers representing the size of the field (n), the number of apple trees (m), and the movement vector (dx, dy) such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n; followed by m pairs of integers (xi, yi) representing the coordinates of the apple trees with 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1. The value of `b` is greater than 0.
    g, tmp_x, tmp_y = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
    return g, x, y
    #The program returns the values of g, x (which is assigned the value of tmp_y), and y (calculated as tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a`, 1, and 0. If `b` is greater than 0, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and then calculates values `x` and `y` based on the results of that call. The final return values are `g`, `x`, and `y`, where `g` is the result of the recursive call, `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`, and `y` is calculated as `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`. The function effectively implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, returning the greatest common divisor and coefficients for expressing it as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.
