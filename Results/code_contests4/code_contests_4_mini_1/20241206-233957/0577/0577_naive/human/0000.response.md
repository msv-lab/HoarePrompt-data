Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to solve the problem of counting distinct names among the k-sons of a person in a family tree. However, there are several issues that could lead to incorrect output.

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 (it should use `input()`). This will cause an error if the program is run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Data Structure Initialization**: The program initializes `child`, `query`, and `ans` with sets or dictionaries, but the way it handles these structures may lead to unexpected results. For example, `ans` is initialized as a dictionary with sets, but the logic for populating and accessing these sets is not straightforward and may lead to incorrect counts.

3. **Error in Logic for k-sons**: The logic within the `func_1` function that computes the distinct names for k-sons is convoluted and may not correctly account for all cases. For instance, if a person has multiple children with the same name, the program may not handle these duplicates correctly when counting unique names.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not appear to handle cases where a person has no ancestors or when `ki` is greater than the depth of the tree for a given `vi`. For example, if `vi = 1` and `ki = 3` in a tree where person 1 has only two generations of descendants, the program should return 0, but the logic may not account for this properly.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program uses `print(answer[i])`, which will print each answer on a new line. However, according to the problem statement, the output should be whitespace-separated integers on a single line.

Given these potential issues, the program does not correctly implement the specified functionality in all scenarios, making it incorrect.
