The statement `answer[j] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the index `j` of the list `answer`. The variables `x`, `dep`, `nowlistindex`, `previous_nowlistindex`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. The previous values of `j`, which is assigned the value from `query[x][previous_nowlistindex + 3]`, determine which index of `answer` is being modified. Thus, the output state reflects the assignment made to `answer[j]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `nowlistindex` is `previous_nowlistindex + 2`; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][previous_nowlistindex + 3]`; `answer[j]` is 0.**
