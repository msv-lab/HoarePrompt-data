According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans[x]`. For the loop to execute, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element. Given that the length of `ans[x]` is currently less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, it implies that `ans[x]` could potentially be empty. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes for the first time, `ans[x]` must have at least one element, which means we need to adjust the state of `ans[x]`.

State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[x]` must have at least 1 element**
