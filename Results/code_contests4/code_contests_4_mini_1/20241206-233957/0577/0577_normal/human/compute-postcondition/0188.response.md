The operation `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list or array `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The variables `x`, `dep`, `answer`, and `ans` remain unchanged in their values except for the specific list being cleared. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared.**
