Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `answer` remains unchanged. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
