Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `answer` remains unchanged. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is now empty. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]` and is updated accordingly.***
