The code assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. The variable `fa[x]` represents the ancestor of `x`, and since `ans[fa[x]]` has at least one element, `j` is a valid index. The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is copied to `ans[x][j]`, meaning `ans[x][j]` will now hold the same value as `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is copied to `ans[x][j]`, and `j` is not in `ans[x]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is copied to `ans[x][j]`, and `j` is not in `ans[x]**.
