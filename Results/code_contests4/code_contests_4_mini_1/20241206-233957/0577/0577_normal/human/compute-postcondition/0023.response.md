Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `nowlistindex` is updated to `nowlistindex + 2` (ensuring `nowlistindex` remains less than `len(query[x])`), and `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `nowlistindex` is updated to `nowlistindex + 2` (again ensuring `nowlistindex` is less than `len(query[x])`), and `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
