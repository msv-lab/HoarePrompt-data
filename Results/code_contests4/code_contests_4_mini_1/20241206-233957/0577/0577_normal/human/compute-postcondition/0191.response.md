The variable `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous state of `ans[x][j]` is cleared, but now it takes on the value from the ancestor `fa[x]` at the same index `j`. The values of `x`, `dep`, and `answer` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `answer` remains unchanged; `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `answer` remains unchanged; `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]**
