Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `answer` is an array where each `answer[j]` corresponds to either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, `fa[x]` is valid and `ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty for the loop to execute, j is the first element in ans[fa[x]], and `j` is in `ans[x]`.***
