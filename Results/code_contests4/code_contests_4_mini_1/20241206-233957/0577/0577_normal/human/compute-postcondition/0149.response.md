Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, and `j` is the next index in `ans[x]` which is currently being processed. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
