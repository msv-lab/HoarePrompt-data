The assignment `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` copies the value from `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The variable `fa[x]` indicates the ancestor of `x`, and `j` is the index being processed. The contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` were previously cleared, meaning it is now being set to the value of `ans[x][j]`. The other variables `x`, `dep`, `answer`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `answer` remains unchanged; `j` is the next index in `ans[x]` which is currently being processed; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
