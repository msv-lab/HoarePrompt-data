The operation `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` is called, which clears all elements from the list or collection at `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that whatever elements were previously contained in that specific collection are removed. The values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are not directly affected by this operation, but the state of `ans[fa[x]][j]` changes due to the clearing.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` remains updated with elements from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, but now `ans[fa[x]][j]` is empty after the clear operation.

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is updated with elements from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, but `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty.**
