Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`. If `j` is not present in `ans[x]`, then `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]` not found in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `j` is in `ans[x]`, and if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The `answer` array corresponds to either 0 or the lengths of `ans[x][dep + i]` as appropriate, and `fa[x]` is valid with `ans[fa[x]]` being non-empty.***
