To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the condition `x != -1`. For the loop to run again, the value of `x` must not be equal to -1.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n), which means `x` is currently within the valid range. 

Since the loop's condition checks if `x` is not equal to -1, there is no need to modify `x`, as it is guaranteed to be in the range of 1 to n. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, there are no adjustments needed for `x` or any other variables.

State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n) and `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors (1 ≤ dep ≤ n)**
