Postcondition: ***`x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, `answer` contains the values assigned based on the conditions checked during the loop iterations, `ans[x]` may contain keys that are dependent on `dep + i` for the respective indices processed in the loop; we are counting the answers, and the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
