The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` invokes the `clear()` method on the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This operation empties the list at the specified index. The `fa[x]` refers to the ancestor of `x`, and `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`. 

Since `answer` remains unchanged and only the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` is affected, the output state will reflect that this specific list has been cleared. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `answer` remains unchanged; `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared.**
