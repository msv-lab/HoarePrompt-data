The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `dep`. The parameter `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, constrained such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\), where \(n\) is the total number of individuals in the family tree. The parameter `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, constrained such that \(1 \leq dep \leq n\). 

The function likely processes these inputs to determine and return information about the ancestors of the individual represented by `x` up to the specified depth `dep`. However, the exact return values or behavior based on the parameters are not given in the output description. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` representing a person in the family tree and a positive integer `dep` representing the depth of ancestors, and it processes these inputs to return information about the ancestors of `x` up to the specified depth `dep`.**
