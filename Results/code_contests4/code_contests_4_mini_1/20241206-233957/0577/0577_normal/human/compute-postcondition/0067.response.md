Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `answer` is an array where each `answer[j]` corresponds to either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, `fa[x]` is valid, `ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[x]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.`**
