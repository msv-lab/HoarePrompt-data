The `ans[x][j]` variable is being cleared, which means that all elements in the list or array at `ans[x][j]` are removed. The values of `x`, `dep`, `answer`, and `j` remain unchanged as the operation only affects the contents of `ans[x][j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, `j` is set to `k`, and `ans[x][j]` is now empty.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, `j` is set to `k`, and `ans[x][j]` is now empty.**
