Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `j` is `k + 2`, and `ans[fa[x]]` contains at least `k + 3` elements. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if `ans[x][j]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}` and its length is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty after the clear operation, and `ans[x][j]` retains its previous value. If not, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and its previous content has been cleared.***
