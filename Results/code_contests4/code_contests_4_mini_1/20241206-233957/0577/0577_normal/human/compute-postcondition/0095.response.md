Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` contains the updated values where, if the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[x]` is cleared and `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, while `ans[fa[x]]` is updated based on the processing of `ans[x]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`, retaining the previous states of other variables while including the elements from `ans[x]`.***
