Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `answer` is an array where each `answer[j]` corresponds to either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, and `j` is the first element of `ans[x]` present in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than that of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the values from `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
