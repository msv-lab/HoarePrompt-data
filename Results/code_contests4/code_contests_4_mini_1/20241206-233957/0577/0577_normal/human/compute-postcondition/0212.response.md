The variable `answer[j]` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `j`, which is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`. Therefore, the state of `answer[j]` is now `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with length greater than 0; `nowlistindex` is 0; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][0]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`; `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`; `answer[j]` is 0**.
