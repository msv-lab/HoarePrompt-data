Postcondition: ***`ans[x][j]` is either cleared if its length is less than `ans[fa[x]][j]`, in which case `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR with `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][dep]` remains `{ss[x]}`. If `ans[x][j]` is not cleared, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the value of `ans[x][j]`, while `ans[x][j]` retains its updated state through a bitwise OR with the cleared value if the loop executes again.***
