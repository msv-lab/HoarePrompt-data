According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ans[x]` array. For the loop to execute, `ans[x]` must not be empty, meaning it should contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `answer` is an array corresponding to the processed pairs from `query[x]`, but it does not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `ans[x]` should have at least one element, and `j` will be set to the first element of `ans[x]`.

State: **`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `answer` is an array where each `answer[j]` corresponds to either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[x]` has at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element of `ans[x]`**
