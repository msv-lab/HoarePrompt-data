The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the list at the index `j` of `ans[fa[x]]`. The other variables and their states are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, `j` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list after the clear operation.

Output State: **`x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, `j` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list.**
