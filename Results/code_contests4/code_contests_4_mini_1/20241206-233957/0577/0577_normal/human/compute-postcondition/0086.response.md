The operation `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous operation indicates that `ans[x][j]` was updated using a bitwise OR with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, meaning that `ans[fa[x]][j]` held some value before it was cleared. After executing the `clear()` method, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be empty, but `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged from the previous state. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` retains its previous value; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty after the clear operation. 

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` retains its previous value; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty after the clear operation.**
