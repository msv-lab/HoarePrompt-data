Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n) and `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors (1 ≤ dep ≤ n). If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1, while `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `x` is updated to the child at index `nowChild[x]` in the `Child[x]` list, `dep` is increased by 1, and `nowChild[x]` remains unchanged.***
