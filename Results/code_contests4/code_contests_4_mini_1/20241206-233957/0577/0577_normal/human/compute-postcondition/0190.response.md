The command `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list or array at the position `ans[x][j]`. This operation does not change the values of `x`, `dep`, `answer`, or any other variable; it only affects the specific data structure referred to by `ans[x][j]`. As such, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables while noting the modification made.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `answer` remains unchanged; `ans[x][j]` is cleared.**
