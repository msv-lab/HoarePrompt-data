Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree and `dep` is a positive integer. If `x` is not equal to 0, `ans[x]` is updated such that if the length of `ans[x]` is less than that of `ans[fa[x]]`, it is cleared and `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, while `ans[fa[x]]` is updated based on the processing of `ans[x]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`, retaining the previous states of other variables while incorporating elements from `ans[x]`.***
