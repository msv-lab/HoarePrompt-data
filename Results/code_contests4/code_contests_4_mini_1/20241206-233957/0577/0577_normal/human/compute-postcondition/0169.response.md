The `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` operation clears the contents of the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This affects the variable `ans`, specifically the list at the index `[fa[x]][j]`, while the other variables (`x`, `dep`, `answer`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now cleared.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now cleared.**
