Postcondition: ***`x` is not -1. If `x` is not 0, then `query[x]` is a list with an even length, and `answer` contains values assigned based on the conditions checked during all loop iterations. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[x]` is cleared, and `ans[fa[x]]` may be modified based on the relationships established with `ans[x]`. Otherwise, `ans[x]` contains values updated based on the conditions checked during the loop iterations, `ans[fa[x]]` may be empty for certain keys, and the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[fa[x]]` is cleared and assigned the values of `ans[x]`. If `x` is 0, no changes occur to the lists and `answer`.***
