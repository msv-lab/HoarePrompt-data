The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list or array at the position `j` in `ans[x]`. The operation affects only the specified index in the `ans` structure, removing all elements from `ans[x][j]`. The values of `x`, `dep`, `answer`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `answer` remains unchanged; `j` is the next index in `ans[x]` which is currently being processed; `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `answer` remains unchanged; `j` is the next index in `ans[x]` which is currently being processed; `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list.**
