Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `answer` remains unchanged. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[x]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x]` contains updated values based on the relationships and conditions evaluated during the loop iterations, and `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`, thus `ans[fa[x]]` is now updated accordingly.***
