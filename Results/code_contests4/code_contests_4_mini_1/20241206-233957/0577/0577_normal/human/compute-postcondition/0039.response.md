Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`. If `j` is not present in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is present in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than that of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the values from `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
