Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `answer` remains unchanged. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is copied to `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
