Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `nowlistindex` is `previous_nowlistindex + 2`, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, and `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][previous_nowlistindex + 3]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the value of `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.***
