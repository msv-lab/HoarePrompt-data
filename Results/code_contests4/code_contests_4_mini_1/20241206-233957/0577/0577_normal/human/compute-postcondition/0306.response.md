The value of `dep` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`x`, `nowChild[x]`, and `lenChild[x]`) are not affected by this line of code. Since `x` is assigned a value and is not -1, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, the conditions for the loop are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is increased by 1, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]` and `x` must not be -1 for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is increased by 1, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, and `x` must not be -1 for the loop to execute again.**
