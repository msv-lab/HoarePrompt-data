According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to -1. Right before the loop, `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, and it is stated that \(1 \leq x \leq n\). Since `x` is constrained to be at least 1, it cannot be -1. Therefore, the loop can execute at least once without any adjustments.

State: **`x` is an integer representing the person in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors (1 ≤ dep ≤ n)**
