Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to its parent `fa[x]`, `dep` is decreased by 1, `answer` remains unchanged, and `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is increased by 1, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.***
