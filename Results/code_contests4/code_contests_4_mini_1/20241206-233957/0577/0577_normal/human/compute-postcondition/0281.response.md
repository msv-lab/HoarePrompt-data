The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` will execute the `clear()` method on the list located at `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which removes all elements from that list. Prior to this operation, the state of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is a list with its previous elements, but we do not have information on the specific elements in it.

Since `x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, and `j` is the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the previous values of `ans[fa[x]][j]` are not directly provided. However, we can conclude that `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be emptied.

Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, `j` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared.

Output State: **`x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, `j` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared.**
