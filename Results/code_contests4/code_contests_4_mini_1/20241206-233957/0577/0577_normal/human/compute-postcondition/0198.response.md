Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `answer` remains unchanged. If `x` is not equal to 0, then if the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[x]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x]` is updated based on the relationships and conditions evaluated during the loop iterations, and `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`, thus updating `ans[fa[x]]` accordingly.***
