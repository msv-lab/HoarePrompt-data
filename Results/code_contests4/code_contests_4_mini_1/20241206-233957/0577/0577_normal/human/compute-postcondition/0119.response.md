Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `nowlistindex` has been increased by 2. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
