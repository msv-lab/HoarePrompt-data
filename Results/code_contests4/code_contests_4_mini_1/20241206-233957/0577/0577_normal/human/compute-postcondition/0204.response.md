The value of `dep` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dep` is a positive integer, so after execution, `dep` will be one greater than its initial value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is a positive integer (now increased by 1), `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is a positive integer (now increased by 1), `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`**.
