Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `answer` remains unchanged. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated using a bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, where `ans[fa[x]][j]` corresponds to the ancestor of `x` at depth `j`.`***
