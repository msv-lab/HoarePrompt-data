Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `answer` remains unchanged. If `j` is not present in the ancestor list `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` becomes empty; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to hold the same elements as `ans[x][j]`.***
