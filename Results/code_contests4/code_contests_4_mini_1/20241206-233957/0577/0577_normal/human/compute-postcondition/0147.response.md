The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list or collection at the position `j` of the list `ans[fa[x]]`. The variables `x`, `dep`, `answer`, and `j` remain unchanged, and only the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` are affected. Therefore, the output state indicates that the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` have been cleared.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `answer` remains unchanged; `j` is the next index in `ans[x]` which is currently being processed; the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` have been cleared.**
