Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` contains values based on the conditions checked in the loop for all pairs in `query[x]`, where each `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` for corresponding pairs of `i` and `j`. If the loop does not execute, `answer` remains unchanged.**
