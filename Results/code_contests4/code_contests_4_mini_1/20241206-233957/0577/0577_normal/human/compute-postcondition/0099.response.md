The variable `dep` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `dep` is not provided, so we cannot specify its exact value after the operation. The other variables (`x`, `ans[x]`, `ans[fa[x]]`, and `nowChild[x]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `ans[x]` remains unchanged, `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `ans[x]` remains unchanged, `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1.**
