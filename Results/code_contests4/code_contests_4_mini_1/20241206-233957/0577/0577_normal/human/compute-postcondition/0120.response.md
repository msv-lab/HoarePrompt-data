According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `query[x]` and the current value of `nowlistindex`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `nowlistindex` is less than the length of `query[x]`. At the end of the last iteration, `nowlistindex` has been increased by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nowlistindex` must be less than the length of `query[x]`, and it will be updated to its next value, which will be the current `nowlistindex` plus 2.

If `nowlistindex` was the value at the end of the last iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `nowlistindex` will be updated to this value plus 2. This means for the loop to execute again, `nowlistindex` should now be increased by 2.

Thus, if we denote the previous `nowlistindex` as `previous_nowlistindex`, the new value will be `previous_nowlistindex + 2`, and the loop can continue if `previous_nowlistindex + 2` is still less than the length of `query[x]`.

State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `nowlistindex` is `previous_nowlistindex + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `nowlistindex` must be less than the length of `query[x]`**.
