In the initial state, `ans[x][j]` is updated with elements from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, but `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty. The code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Since `ans[fa[x]][j]` is empty, after execution, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will now hold the elements that were in `ans[x][j]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to hold the same elements as `ans[x][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` remains unchanged; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to hold the same elements as `ans[x][j]`**.
