Postcondition: ***`x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, `answer` contains values assigned based on the conditions checked during the loop iterations, and `ans[x]` contains at least 1 element. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, the loop will continue executing. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than that of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
