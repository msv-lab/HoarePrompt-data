The code assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list and the assignment occurs from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` will take on the values from `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The initial conditions state that `fa[x]` is valid, `ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Therefore, after the assignment, `ans[x][j]` will have the same values as `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**.
