Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`, and there must be more keys in `ans[x]` for the loop to execute a second time. Otherwise, if `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[x][j]` is cleared if its length is less than `ans[fa[x]][j]`, leading to `ans[fa[x]][j]` being updated by performing a bitwise OR with `ans[x][j]`, while `ans[x][dep]` remains `{ss[x]}`. If `ans[x][j]` is not cleared, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the value of `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` retains its updated state through a bitwise OR with the cleared value should the loop execute again.***
