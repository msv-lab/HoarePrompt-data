Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `answer` is an array where each `answer[j]` corresponds to either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, and `j` is the first element of `ans[x]` which is present in `ans[fa[x]]`. The length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
