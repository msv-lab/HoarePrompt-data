Postcondition: ***`x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, and `j` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if `len(ans[x][j])` is greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
