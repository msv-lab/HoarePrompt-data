Postcondition: ***`x` is not -1 and `query[x]` is a list with an even length. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if `j` is in `ans[x]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than that of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` holds the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
