Postcondition: ***`ans[x][j]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty after the clear operation, and `ans[x][j]` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and its previous content has been cleared.***
