The variable `j` is assigned the value `query[x][1]`, and `ans[x][dep + i]` is accessed to compute its length using `len()`. The result is then assigned to `answer[j]`. Since `dep`, `i`, and `ans[x]` are previously defined, the output state will reflect the current lengths of `ans[x][dep + i]` stored in `answer[j]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][0]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`; `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.**
