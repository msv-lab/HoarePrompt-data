Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `answer` is an array where each `answer[j]` corresponds to either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, `fa[x]` is valid and `ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty for the loop to execute, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[x]`. The length of `ans[x][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
