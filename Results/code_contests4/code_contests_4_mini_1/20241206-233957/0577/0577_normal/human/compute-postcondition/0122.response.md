The variable `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. The value of `nowlistindex` is `previous_nowlistindex + 2`, so `nowlistindex + 1` will be `previous_nowlistindex + 3`. The value of `j` will depend on the values in the `query` data structure at the specified indices. The previous values of `x`, `dep`, and `nowlistindex` are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `nowlistindex` is `previous_nowlistindex + 2`; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][previous_nowlistindex + 3]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree; `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors; `nowlistindex` is `previous_nowlistindex + 2`; `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][previous_nowlistindex + 3]`.**
