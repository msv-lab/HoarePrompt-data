Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If not, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, `ans[x][dep]` still contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
