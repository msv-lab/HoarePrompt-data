The command `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of `ans[x][j]`, which means that it removes all elements from the list or array at that specific index. The variables `x`, `dep`, `answer`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remain unchanged aside from the clearing of `ans[x][j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, and `ans[x][j]` is now empty.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, and `ans[x][j]` is now empty.**
