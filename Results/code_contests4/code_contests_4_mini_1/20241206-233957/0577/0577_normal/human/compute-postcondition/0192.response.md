Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, and `answer` remains unchanged. If `len(ans[x][j])` is greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
