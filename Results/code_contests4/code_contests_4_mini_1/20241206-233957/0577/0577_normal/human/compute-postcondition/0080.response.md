In this code snippet, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that whatever value is currently stored in `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now assigned to `ans[x][j]`. The previous values of `ans[x][j]` are not explicitly mentioned, but the operation indicates that `ans[x][j]` will now hold the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`. 

The state of other variables, including `fa[x]`, `x`, and `j`, remains unchanged, and no values are returned in this operation.

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
