Postcondition: ***`x` must not be -1 for the loop to execute again. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, `query`, `ans`, and `answer` remain unchanged, and `dep` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is increased by 1, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.***
