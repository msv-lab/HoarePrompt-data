Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `i` is assigned the first element of `query[x]`, `nowlistindex` is 0, and `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`. If `dep + i` is not present in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
