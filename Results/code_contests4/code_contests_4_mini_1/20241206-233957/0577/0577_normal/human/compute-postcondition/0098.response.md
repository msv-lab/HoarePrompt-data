The value of `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` remain unchanged, and the previous states of other variables are retained. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `ans[x]` remains unchanged, `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `ans[x]` remains unchanged, `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1.**
