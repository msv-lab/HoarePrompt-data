The `ans[x][j]` list is cleared, which means that all previous values it held are removed. The other variables, including `x`, `dep`, `answer`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, `ans[x][j]` is now empty.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing a person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors, `answer` remains unchanged, `ans[x][j]` is now empty.**
