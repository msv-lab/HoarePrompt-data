The variable `ans[x][dep]` is assigned the value of `{ss[x]}`, which indicates that the set at `ans[x][dep]` now contains the value from `ss[x]`. The variables `x` and `dep` are currently representing a person in the family tree and the depth of ancestors, respectively. The state of the other variables is not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`; `x` is an integer representing the person in the family tree, `dep` is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors.**
