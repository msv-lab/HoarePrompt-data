Postcondition: ***`x` is not -1, `query[x]` is a list with an even length, `answer` contains the values assigned based on the conditions checked during the loop iterations, `ans[x]` contains at least 1 element, and `ans[x]` may contain keys that are dependent on `dep + i` for the respective indices processed in the loop; if `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include values from `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared and assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. In all cases, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`.***
