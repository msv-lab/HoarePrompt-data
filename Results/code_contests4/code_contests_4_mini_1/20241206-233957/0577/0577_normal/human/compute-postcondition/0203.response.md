The variable `x` is assigned the value `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, where `Child` is presumably a list or array representing the children of each person in the family tree, and `nowChild[x]` is the index of the current child for person `x`. Since `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, it indicates that there are still children to traverse for the person represented by `x`. The other variables (`dep`, `Child`, `nowChild`, and `lenChild`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, and the values of `dep`, `Child`, `nowChild`, and `lenChild` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is a positive integer, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`**
