Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and the previous state of `ans[x][dep]` remains unchanged. The loop can execute again if `j` is `k + 1` and `ans[fa[x]]` contains at least `k + 2` elements. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][dep]` contains the value of `{ss[x]}`, `j` is `k + 1`, and `ans[fa[x]]` contains at least `k + 2` elements. If `len(ans[x][j])` is greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
