You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarpus got hold of a family tree. The found tree describes the family relations of n people, numbered from 1 to n. Every person in this tree has at most one direct ancestor. Also, each person in the tree has a name, the names are not necessarily unique.

We call the man with a number a a 1-ancestor of the man with a number b, if the man with a number a is a direct ancestor of the man with a number b.

We call the man with a number a a k-ancestor (k > 1) of the man with a number b, if the man with a number b has a 1-ancestor, and the man with a number a is a (k - 1)-ancestor of the 1-ancestor of the man with a number b.

In the tree the family ties do not form cycles. In other words there isn't a person who is his own direct or indirect ancestor (that is, who is an x-ancestor of himself, for some x, x > 0).

We call a man with a number a the k-son of the man with a number b, if the man with a number b is a k-ancestor of the man with a number a.

Polycarpus is very much interested in how many sons and which sons each person has. He took a piece of paper and wrote m pairs of numbers vi, ki. Help him to learn for each pair vi, ki the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons of the man with number vi.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of people in the tree. Next n lines contain the description of people in the tree. The i-th line contains space-separated string si and integer ri (0 ≤ ri ≤ n), where si is the name of the man with a number i, and ri is either the number of the direct ancestor of the man with a number i or 0, if the man with a number i has no direct ancestor. 

The next line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of Polycarpus's records. Next m lines contain space-separated pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers vi, ki (1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n).

It is guaranteed that the family relationships do not form cycles. The names of all people are non-empty strings, consisting of no more than 20 lowercase English letters.

Output

Print m whitespace-separated integers — the answers to Polycarpus's records. Print the answers to the records in the order, in which the records occur in the input.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the person in the family tree (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and dep is a positive integer representing the depth of ancestors (1 ≤ dep ≤ n).
def func_1(x, dep):
    while x != -1:
        if nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]:
            if x != 0:
                ans[x][dep] = {ss[x]}
                for nowlistindex in range(0, len(query[x]), 2):
                    i = query[x][nowlistindex]
                    j = query[x][nowlistindex + 1]
                    if dep + i not in ans[x]:
                        answer[j] = 0
                    else:
                        answer[j] = len(ans[x][dep + i])
                """count ans"""
                if len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]]):
                    for j in ans[x]:
                        if j not in ans[fa[x]]:
                            ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]
                        elif len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j]):
                            ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]
                            ans[x][j].clear()
                        else:
                            ans[x][j] |= ans[fa[x]][j]
                            ans[fa[x]][j].clear()
                            ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]
                    ans[x].clear()
                else:
                    for j in ans[fa[x]]:
                        if j not in ans[x]:
                            ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]
                        elif len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j]):
                            ans[x][j] |= ans[fa[x]][j]
                            ans[fa[x]][j].clear()
                        else:
                            ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]
                            ans[x][j].clear()
                            ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]
                    ans[fa[x]].clear()
                    ans[fa[x]] = ans[x]
            x = fa[x]
            nowChild[x] += 1
            dep -= 1
        else:
            x = Child[x][nowChild[x]]
            dep += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is -1, `dep` is the initial depth minus the number of ancestors processed, `nowChild` for each ancestor processed has been incremented by 1, and `ans` contains the results of merging ancestor information based on the relationships defined in the family tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` representing a person in a family tree and a positive integer `dep` representing the depth of ancestors to process. It traverses the family tree upwards, merging information about ancestors up to the specified depth. The function handles cases where the current person has no more children to process and updates ancestor information accordingly. It modifies several data structures related to ancestors, including `ans`, `nowChild`, and `fa`, but it does not explicitly return any value or output. The final state of these data structures reflects the merged ancestor information based on the relationships defined in the family tree.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
