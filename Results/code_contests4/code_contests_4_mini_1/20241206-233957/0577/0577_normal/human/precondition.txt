n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of people in the family tree. Each of the next n lines contains a string si (the name of the person, consisting of no more than 20 lowercase English letters) and an integer ri (the direct ancestor's number, where 0 indicates no direct ancestor and 0 ≤ ri ≤ n). m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries. Each of the next m lines contains two integers vi and ki, where 1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n.
