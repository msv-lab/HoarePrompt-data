Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The problem requires a shell that handles two commands, `cd` to change directories and `pwd` to print the current directory. The program provided, however, only defines a function that returns a map object containing integers parsed from input, which does not relate to changing directories or displaying the current directory.

Specifically, the issues are:

1. **Missing Implementation**: The program lacks any logic to handle the `cd` and `pwd` commands. There are no functions or code that would process these commands as specified in the problem description.

2. **Input Handling**: The function appears to only read integers from the input, which does not correspond to the expected commands or parameters related to directory navigation.

3. **State Management**: The program does not maintain any state for the current directory, which is essential for processing the `pwd` command correctly.

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, as it does not implement the necessary functionality to manage directories in a shell environment.
