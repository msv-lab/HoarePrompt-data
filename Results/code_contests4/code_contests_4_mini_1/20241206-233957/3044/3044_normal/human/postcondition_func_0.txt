The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and processes a series of commands that are either "pwd" or "cd" followed by a path. It maintains a current directory state in a list, updating it based on the commands. The "pwd" command outputs the current directory path, while the "cd" command modifies the current directory based on the provided path segments, handling absolute and relative paths, as well as navigating up directories with "..". The function does not return any value directly; instead, it prints the current directory path when "pwd" is invoked.
