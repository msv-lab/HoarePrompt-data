The code `cur.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cur`. The previous value of `cur` is an empty list, so after executing this line, `cur` will contain one element, which is the value of `x`. The variable `i` and the original state of `cur` are not affected in any other way. 

Output State: **`cur` contains the value of `x`, `i` is 2**
