The variable `cur` is assigned an empty list. The values of `i` and `s` are not affected by this assignment, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `s` is reassigned to the second element of the split input string.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is reassigned to the second element of the split input string**
