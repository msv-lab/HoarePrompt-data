According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `int(input())`. If the input value is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `cur` is an empty list and does not affect the loop's execution directly, it needs to be adjusted based on the input. For the loop to execute for the first time, `i` must start at 0, which is the initial value in the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0**
