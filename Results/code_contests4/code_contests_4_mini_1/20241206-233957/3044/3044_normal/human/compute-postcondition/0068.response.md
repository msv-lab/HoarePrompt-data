The code `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by removing its last element. If `cur` is empty, it remains empty. If `cur` contains `x`, the element `x` will be the last element removed. The state of the other variables, including `i` and the result of `s.split('/')`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `cur`.

Output State: **`cur` is either empty or contains `x`, and the last element of `cur` is removed. `i` is 4, and `x` is the fourth element in the list produced by `s.split('/')`.**
