The code prints the string formed by concatenating '/' with the elements of the list `cur`, joined by '/'. Since `cur` is an empty list, `'/'.join(cur)` results in an empty string. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be just '/'.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 'pwd', and the output of the print statement is '/'.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 'pwd', and the output of the print statement is '/'**.
