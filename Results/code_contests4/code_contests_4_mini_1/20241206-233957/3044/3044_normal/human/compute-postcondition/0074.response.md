The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained between 1 and 50. It also accepts a series of commands, each either being "pwd" or "cd" followed by a space and a non-empty parameter consisting of lowercase Latin letters, slashes, and dots. The command parameter can have a length ranging from 1 to 200 characters inclusive. After executing the function body, the output will depend on the commands processed. However, the specific return values are not outlined in the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of commands, which are either "pwd" or "cd" followed by a valid parameter, and return an output based on these commands.
