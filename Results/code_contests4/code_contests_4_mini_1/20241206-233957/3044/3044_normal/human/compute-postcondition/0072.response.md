Postcondition: ***`cur` is an empty list and `i` is 2. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', the output printed is '/'. Otherwise, `cur` contains the valid components of `s` after processing, `i` is the total number of components in the list produced by `s.split('/')`, and `s` is modified to exclude the first character if its first character was '/'.***
