The variable `s` is being split into a list of strings, and the second element of that list (index 1) is being assigned back to `s`. Since `s` is not equal to 'pwd', we can assume that `s` contains at least one space and hence can be split into multiple parts. However, without knowing the exact content of `s`, we cannot determine what the new value of `s` will be. The list `cur` and the variable `i` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `s` is updated to the second element of its original split value.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `s` is updated to the second element of its original split value.**
