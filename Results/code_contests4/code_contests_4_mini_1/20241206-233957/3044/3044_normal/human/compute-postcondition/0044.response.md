According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and how it splits into elements. The loop iterates over each element produced by `s.split('/')`. In the last iteration, `cur` is an empty list and `i` is 1. Since `cur` remains empty when `x` is equal to '..', it implies that `cur` does not change when this condition is met. However, if `x` is not '..', `cur` contains `x`, and in the last iteration, `i` remains 1.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2 after the next iteration, and `x` will be the second element in the split list. Therefore, `cur` still needs to reflect the condition based on the new value of `x`.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `x` is the second element from the split list of `s`**
