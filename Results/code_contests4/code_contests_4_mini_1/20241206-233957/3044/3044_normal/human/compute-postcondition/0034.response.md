According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for each element produced by `s.split('/')`. If the first element of `s` is '/', then `s` will be modified to exclude that first element, which may result in `s` being an empty string if it only contained that element. If the first element is not '/', then `s` remains unchanged. 

Given that `cur` is an empty list and `i` is 1, we need to ensure that `s` contains at least one element after the potential modification for the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `s` is not empty after considering the first element. If `s` starts with '/', the first element will be removed, so we need to ensure that there are additional elements remaining in `s` after the split.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute at least one element must exist in `s` after potential modification, specifically `s` must not be empty after processing the first character.**
