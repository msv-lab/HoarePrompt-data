The variable `cur` is an empty list, and the code appends the value of `x` to it. Since `x` is not equal to '..', it can be safely appended to `cur`. The other variables `i` and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `cur`.

Output State: **`cur` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string, and `x` is not equal to '..'**
