The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`. Since `cur` initially contains one element which is the value of `x`, after executing the code, `cur` will contain two elements, both of which are `x`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the condition regarding `s.split('/')` does not affect the state of `cur`. 

Output State: **`cur` contains two elements which are both the value of `x`, `i` is 1**
