To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variable `s` and its initial state before the loop begins. 

1. The loop iterates over the result of `s.split('/')`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must contain at least one character (otherwise, the result of `s.split('/')` would be a list with an empty string, leading to a single iteration).

2. The variable `cur` being an empty list does not affect the execution of this loop directly.

3. The variable `i` is set to 2, but it does not seem to play a role in the loop's execution based on the provided code snippet.

4. We need to ensure that `s` has a valid state for the loop to execute. If the first character of `s` is '/', then `s` will be updated to exclude that character, which means `s` should have at least one character to begin with.

Based on these considerations, we can conclude:

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be a non-empty string, and if the first character is '/' then `s` is updated to exclude the first character**
