`cur` is an empty list, and the code is appending `x` to `cur`. Since `cur` is initially empty, after this execution, `cur` will contain the value of `x`. The state of the other variables, specifically `i`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` contains `x`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`cur` contains `x`, `i` is 1**
