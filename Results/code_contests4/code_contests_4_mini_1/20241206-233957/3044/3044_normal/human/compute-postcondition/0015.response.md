`cur` is an empty list, and `x` is the first element from `s.split('/')`, which implies `x` is not an empty string or `None`. The operation `cur.append(x)` adds `x` to the `cur` list. As a result, `cur` will contain one element, which is the value of `x`. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` contains `[x]`, `i` is 0, `s` contains at least one '/' after the first character, and `x` is the first element from `s.split('/')`.

Output State: **`cur` contains `[x]`, `i` is 0, `s` contains at least one '/' after the first character, and `x` is the first element from `s.split('/')`.**
