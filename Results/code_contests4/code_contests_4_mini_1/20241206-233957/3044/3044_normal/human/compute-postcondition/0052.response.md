The code prints the string formatted by joining the elements of the list `cur` with a '/' character. Since `cur` is an empty list, the `join` method will result in an empty string. Therefore, the output will be the string '/' followed by nothing.

The states of the other variables (`i` and `s`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is an input string, and the output printed is '/'**.
