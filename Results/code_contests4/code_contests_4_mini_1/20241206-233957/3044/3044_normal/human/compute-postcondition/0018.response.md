The operation `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by slicing it to exclude the last element. Since `cur` is currently an empty list, slicing it in this manner will still result in an empty list. The values of `i` and the condition regarding `s.split('/')` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is still an empty list, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`cur` is still an empty list, `i` is 1**
