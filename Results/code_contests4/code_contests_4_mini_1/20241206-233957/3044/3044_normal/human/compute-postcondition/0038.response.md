`cur` is an empty list, and `x` is being appended to `cur`. The value of `x` is not specified but is confirmed to not be equal to '..'. Therefore, after execution, `cur` will have one element, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `cur` is now a list containing `x`, `i` is 1, and `x` is not equal to '..'.

Output State: **`cur` is now a list containing `x`, `i` is 1, and `x` is not equal to '..'**.
