`cur` remains an empty list, `i` is 1, and `s` is reassigned to its elements starting from the second element (index 1) onward. Since the initial state does not provide the content of `s`, we cannot determine the specific elements of `s` after the reassignment. However, we can state that `s` will now contain all elements of the original `s` except the first one.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is reassigned to all elements of the original `s` except the first one**.
