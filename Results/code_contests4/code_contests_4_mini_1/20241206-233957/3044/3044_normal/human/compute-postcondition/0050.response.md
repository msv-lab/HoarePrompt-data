According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input value that is being processed for the loop. The loop uses `range(int(input()))`, which means it will iterate based on the integer input provided. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, indicating that one iteration has been completed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the input must specify a total of at least 2 iterations (since `i` starts from 0). The next value of `i` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.

Since `cur` is an empty list at the end of the last iteration, it does not affect the ability of the loop to execute again.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time the input must be at least 2**
