The code `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by assigning it the value of itself without the last element. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, attempting to slice it will still result in an empty list. Therefore, the state of `cur` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` contains at least one '/' after the first character, `x` is the first element from `s.split('/')`, and `x` is equal to '..'**
