Postcondition: ***`cur` is an empty list and `i` is 0. If `s` is 'pwd', the output of the print statement is '/'. Otherwise, `cur` contains the valid segments from `s` excluding any segments that are `'..'`, `i` is the total number of segments processed from `s.split('/')`, and `s` is the original substring starting from the second character.***
