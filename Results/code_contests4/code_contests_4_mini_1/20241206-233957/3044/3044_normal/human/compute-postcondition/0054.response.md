The code assigns an empty list to the variable `cur`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, but `cur` is now explicitly set as an empty list. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is the second element of the split input string.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is the second element of the split input string**
