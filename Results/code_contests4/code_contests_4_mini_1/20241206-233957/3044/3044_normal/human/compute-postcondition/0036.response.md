The code `cur = cur[:-1]` assigns `cur` the value of itself excluding the last element. Since `cur` is an empty list, slicing it with `cur[:-1]` will still result in an empty list. The values of the other variables `i`, `s`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is not empty after processing the first character, and `x` is equal to '..'.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is not empty after processing the first character, and `x` is equal to '..'**
