The `cur` list is modified by slicing off the last element with `cur[:-1]`. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, slicing it will still result in an empty list. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and the last element is attempted to be removed from `cur`, but it remains empty.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and the last element is attempted to be removed from `cur`, but it remains empty.**
