The code `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by removing the last element. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, slicing it with `cur[:-1]` will result in still an empty list, as there are no elements to remove. The values of the other variables, `i` and `x`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `x` is the second element from the split list of `s`, and `cur` remains an empty list.**
