According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and its split results. The loop iterates through the elements generated by `s.split('/')`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either an empty list and `i` is 1 if `x` equals '..'; or `cur` contains one element which is the value of `x`, with `i` remaining 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in `s.split('/')`. If `s.split('/')` has more elements, then `i` will be incremented to the next index, and `x` will contain the next element from the split result.

Thus, if `x` is not '..' and `cur` contains the value of `x`, then for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented, and `cur` will contain the next value from the split result.

State: **`cur` contains one element which is the value of `x`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s.split('/')` must have at least 2 elements and `x` will be the second element in the split result**.
