Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the `cd` command is given with a relative path that leads to the parent directory above the current directory. For example, consider the following sequence of commands:

```
3
cd a
cd ..
pwd
```

In this case, the program should output `/` because the second command `cd ..` attempts to go to the parent directory of the current directory (which is `a`), but the current directory is already at the root level. However, the program does not check if the `cur` list is empty before executing `cur = cur[:-1]`, which would incorrectly alter the state of `cur` if it is already empty (i.e., attempting to go above the root). 

Thus, it could lead to an incorrect state where `cur` is modified improperly, resulting in unexpected outputs for the `pwd` command. This is a clear violation of the problem's requirements, which guarantees that there will be no attempt to transition to the parent directory of the root directory.
