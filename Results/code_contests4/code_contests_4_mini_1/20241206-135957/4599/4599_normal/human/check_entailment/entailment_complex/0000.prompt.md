You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1. Two binary strings a and b of equal length are similar, if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer i such that a_i = b_i). For example:

  * 10010 and 01111 are similar (they have the same character in position 4); 
  * 10010 and 11111 are similar; 
  * 111 and 111 are similar; 
  * 0110 and 1001 are not similar. 



You are given an integer n and a binary string s consisting of 2n-1 characters. Let's denote s[l..r] as the contiguous substring of s starting with l-th character and ending with r-th character (in other words, s[l..r] = s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} ... s_r).

You have to construct a binary string w of length n which is similar to all of the following strings: s[1..n], s[2..n+1], s[3..n+2], ..., s[n..2n-1].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The second line of each test case contains the binary string s of length 2n - 1. Each character s_i is either 0 or 1.

Output

For each test case, print the corresponding binary string w of length n. If there are multiple such strings — print any of them. It can be shown that at least one string w meeting the constraints always exists.

Example

Note

The explanation of the sample case (equal characters in equal positions are bold):

The first test case: 

  * 1 is similar to s[1..1] = 1. 



The second test case: 

  * 000 is similar to s[1..3] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[2..4] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[3..5] = 000. 



The third test case: 

  * 1010 is similar to s[1..4] = 1110; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[2..5] = 1100; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[3..6] = 1000; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[4..7] = 0000. 



The fourth test case: 

  * 00 is similar to s[1..2] = 10; 
  * 00 is similar to s[2..3] = 01. 
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1, consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        print(s[::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); for each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `s` is a binary string of length 2n - 1; the output is the concatenation of all characters of `s` at even indices for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `2n - 1`. It then outputs the characters at even indices of the binary string `s` for each test case. The function does not handle any invalid inputs, such as when `n` is not within the specified bounds or when `s` has an incorrect length based on `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is a positive integer for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string, which is expected to consist of integers, into individual elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string of integers inputted via standard input, splits the string into individual elements, and returns a list of integers. It does not enforce the binary nature of the string, meaning it can accept any integers as long as they are space-separated. The function does not validate the input length or format, so if the input does not conform to the expected format, it may raise an error.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string s of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The length of the list o is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), indicating the number of test cases.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by adding each integer from the input to the corresponding tuples in list 'o'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples containing an integer and a binary string, but it incorrectly attempts to add input integers to the list of tuples, which will result in an error; the binary strings are not utilized in the function.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n elements, each being the result of the function func_2() called once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) and a binary string `m`, and returns a list containing `n` elements, each being the result of the function `func_2()` called once. The input binary string `m` is not utilized within the function, which may imply missing functionality related to how `m` should be used or processed.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list generated by calling func_5 with the arguments f and the elements from dim[1:] repeated dim[0] times, or the result of calling f() if dim is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable parameter `f` and a variable-length argument list `dim`. It returns a list generated by calling `func_5` with the arguments `f` and the elements from `dim[1:]` repeated `dim[0]` times if `dim` is not empty. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Note that the function will not handle cases where `dim` is not properly structured or where `dim[0]` is not a positive integer, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
