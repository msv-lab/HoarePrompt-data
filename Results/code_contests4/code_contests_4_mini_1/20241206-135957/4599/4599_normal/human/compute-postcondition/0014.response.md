Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `2n - 1`. It then outputs the characters at even indices of the binary string `s` for each test case. The function does not handle any invalid inputs, such as when `n` is not within the specified bounds or when `s` has an incorrect length based on `n`. **
