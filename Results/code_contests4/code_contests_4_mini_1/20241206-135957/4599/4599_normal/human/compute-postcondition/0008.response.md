According to the code, the loop is controlled by the input taken from `int(input())`, which specifies how many times the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `n` is the input integer that determines how many times the loop runs. Since the loop has run `t` times based on the input, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be increased by 1, and the input must allow for one more iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that the loop will execute one more time based on a new input `n` that must be greater than `t`. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than t**
