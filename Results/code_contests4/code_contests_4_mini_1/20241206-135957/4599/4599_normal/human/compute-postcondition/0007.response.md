The operation `print(s[::2])` outputs every second character from the string `s`. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation, and since `s` is an input string, its specific value is not known.

Thus, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; and the output of `print(s[::2])` is every second character of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; and the output of `print(s[::2])` is every second character of `s`.**
