The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a parameter `n` and a binary string `s`. Here are the details:

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \).
- `s` is a binary string of length \( 2n - 1 \) and consists only of the characters '0' and '1'.

The function processes these test cases and returns an output based on the values of `n` and `s` for each test case. The specific return values or conditions based on the parameters are not described.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a binary string `s`, and processes these inputs to return results based on the test cases.**
