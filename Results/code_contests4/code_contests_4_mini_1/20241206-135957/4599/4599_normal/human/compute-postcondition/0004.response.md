According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, which indicates how many times the loop should run. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and we need to consider how many iterations have been completed and how many are left.

Since `t` is a positive integer, it represents the number of times the outer loop will execute. If the loop has executed `t` times, then for the loop to execute one more time, the input value needs to be at least `t + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, assuming the loop has completed `t` iterations, we have:
- `t` is still a positive integer
- The loop has executed `t` times already

To execute the loop one more time, the input needs to specify that the total number of iterations is now `t + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), for the loop to execute one more time the input integer must be at least `t + 1`**
