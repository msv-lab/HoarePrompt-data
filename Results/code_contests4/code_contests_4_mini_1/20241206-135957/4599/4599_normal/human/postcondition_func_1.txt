The function accepts a binary string of integers inputted via standard input, splits the string into individual elements, and returns a list of integers. It does not enforce the binary nature of the string, meaning it can accept any integers as long as they are space-separated. The function does not validate the input length or format, so if the input does not conform to the expected format, it may raise an error.
