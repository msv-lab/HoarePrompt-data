The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) and a binary string `m`, and returns a list containing `n` elements, each being the result of the function `func_2()` called once. The input binary string `m` is not utilized within the function, which may imply missing functionality related to how `m` should be used or processed.
