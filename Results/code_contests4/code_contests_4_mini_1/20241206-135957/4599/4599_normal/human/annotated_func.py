#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1, consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        print(s[::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); for each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `s` is a binary string of length 2n - 1; the output is the concatenation of all characters of `s` at even indices for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `2n - 1`. It then outputs the characters at even indices of the binary string `s` for each test case. The function does not handle any invalid inputs, such as when `n` is not within the specified bounds or when `s` has an incorrect length based on `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is a positive integer for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string, which is expected to consist of integers, into individual elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string of integers inputted via standard input, splits the string into individual elements, and returns a list of integers. It does not enforce the binary nature of the string, meaning it can accept any integers as long as they are space-separated. The function does not validate the input length or format, so if the input does not conform to the expected format, it may raise an error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string s of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The length of the list o is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), indicating the number of test cases.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by adding each integer from the input to the corresponding tuples in list 'o'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples containing an integer and a binary string, but it incorrectly attempts to add input integers to the list of tuples, which will result in an error; the binary strings are not utilized in the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n elements, each being the result of the function func_2() called once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) and a binary string `m`, and returns a list containing `n` elements, each being the result of the function `func_2()` called once. The input binary string `m` is not utilized within the function, which may imply missing functionality related to how `m` should be used or processed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list generated by calling func_5 with the arguments f and the elements from dim[1:] repeated dim[0] times, or the result of calling f() if dim is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable parameter `f` and a variable-length argument list `dim`. It returns a list generated by calling `func_5` with the arguments `f` and the elements from `dim[1:]` repeated `dim[0]` times if `dim` is not empty. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Note that the function will not handle cases where `dim` is not properly structured or where `dim[0]` is not a positive integer, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.
