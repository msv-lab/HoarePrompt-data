The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `h` representing the heights of towers. It counts how many times the cumulative height of towers, when processed from the tallest down to the shortest, exceeds the threshold `k`. The final output is the total number of slices, which indicates how many times the cumulative height surpassed `k`. The function does not return information about towers below the height limit, nor does it indicate the total number of towers; it only outputs the count of slices.
