Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is an integer (n ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `h` is a Counter of the heights from user input. If `cnt + tot` is greater than `k`, then `tot` is updated to `tot + h[199999]`, `cnt` is updated to `tot`, `slices` is updated to `slices + 1`, and `slices` is greater than or equal to 0 when `i` is in `h`. Otherwise, `tot` is updated to `tot + h[199999]`, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + tot`, and `slices` is 0 when `i` is in `h`, with no change to the state if `i` is not in `h`.***
