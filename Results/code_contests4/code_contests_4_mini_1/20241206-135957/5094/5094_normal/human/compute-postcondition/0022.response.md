The variable `tot` is incremented by the value of `h[i]`. The value of `h[i]` is determined by user input and reflects the height at index `i`. Since `i` must be `i - 1` for the loop to execute again, the previous value of `i` is not provided, but it is implied that it is within the bounds of the `Counter` object `h`. The state of `tot` will now include the height from `h` at the current index `i`. Other variables are not directly affected by this statement.

Output State: **`tot` is updated by adding `h[i]`, where `h[i]` is the height at index `i`.**
