Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is an integer (n ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `h` is a Counter of the heights from user input, `tot` is `h[200000]`, and the minimum of `h` is less than or equal to 200,000 with `i` being 200,000 present in `h`. If `cnt + tot` is greater than `k`, then `cnt` is equal to `tot`, `slices` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + tot`, `slices` is 0, and the sum of `cnt` and `tot` is less than or equal to `k.***
