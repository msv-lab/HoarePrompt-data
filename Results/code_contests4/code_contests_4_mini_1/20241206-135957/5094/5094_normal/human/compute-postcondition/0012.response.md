Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is an integer (n ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `h` is a Counter of the heights from user input, `tot` is `h[200000]`, `cnt` is `cnt + tot`, `slices` is 0, the minimum of `h` is less than or equal to 200,000, and `i` is 200,000 and is present in `h`. The sum of `cnt` and `tot` is still less than or equal to `k`.**
