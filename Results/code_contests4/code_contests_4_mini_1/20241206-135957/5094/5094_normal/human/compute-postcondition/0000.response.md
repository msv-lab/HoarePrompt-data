The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the results of `map(int, input().split(' '))`, where `input()` will accept two integers separated by a space. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not affected or changed directly by this code snippet; instead, they are updated to the new values received from the input. The list `h` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is an integer (n ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and `h` is a list of n integers where each integer h_i represents the height of a tower (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5); `n` and `k` are now updated based on user input.**
