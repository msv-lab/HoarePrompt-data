Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is an integer (n ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `h` is a Counter of the heights from user input, `tot` is updated to `tot + h[199999]`, `cnt` is updated accordingly, and `slices` is 0 when `i` is in `h`. If `i` is not in `h`, the state remains unchanged.***
