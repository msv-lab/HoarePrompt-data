Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly determining the minimal number of jumps required to reach point `x`. 

1. The program calculates `n` as the absolute value of the input, but it doesn't handle the case where `x` is negative correctly. The logic for determining the number of jumps does not account for the fact that Jack can jump in both directions.
   
2. The calculation of `d` (the number of complete jumps) and the subsequent adjustment based on parity and mod 4 does not cover all scenarios accurately, especially when `x` is near the limits of the range or when `x` is 0. 

For example, consider the input `-3`:
- The expected output is `2` because Jack can jump as follows: 1 (to -1), then 2 (to -3).
- However, since the program only takes the absolute value of `x`, it would treat `-3` as `3`, and based on the flawed logic, it would produce an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, leading to a determination of correctness as false.
