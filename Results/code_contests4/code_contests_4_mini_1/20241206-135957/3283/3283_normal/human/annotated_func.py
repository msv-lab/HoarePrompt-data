#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = abs(input())
    d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
    print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer input from the user, calculates a value based on the input using a mathematical formula involving square roots and modular arithmetic, and prints a result based on that calculation. However, the code does not handle errors for invalid input, such as non-integer values or out-of-bounds integers. Additionally, the use of `print` with incorrect brackets may lead to a syntax error. Overall, the function is intended to compute and output a derived value based on the input integer but lacks proper input validation and error handling.
