The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `x` is an integer that can range from -10^9 to 10^9. However, since the function does not explicitly take `x` as an argument, the output or behavior of the function is not specified. Therefore, it is unclear what the function returns or how it processes the value of `x`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value or behavior is not specified.**
