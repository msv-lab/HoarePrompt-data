Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer input from the user, calculates a value based on the input using a mathematical formula involving square roots and modular arithmetic, and prints a result based on that calculation. However, the code does not handle errors for invalid input, such as non-integer values or out-of-bounds integers. Additionally, the use of `print` with incorrect brackets may lead to a syntax error. Overall, the function is intended to compute and output a derived value based on the input integer but lacks proper input validation and error handling. **
