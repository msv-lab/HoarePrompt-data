To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `x` is an integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.
   - `n` is the absolute value of an input integer, so `n >= 0`.
   - `d` is calculated as `int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))`. This means `d` depends on the value of `n`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The code `print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d` is designed to access an element within a list of lists based on the values of `n` and `d`.
   - The expression `[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]` creates a list that has two sublists.
   - `n % 2` will determine which sublist to access (0 for the first sublist and 1 for the second).
   - `d % 4` will determine the index of the element to access within the chosen sublist.
   - The final result adds the value obtained from the sublist access to `d`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - Since both `n` and `d` are determined by the initial state, we will denote them as variables whose specific values will depend on the input.
   - The output state will include the results of the expression.

Therefore, the output state will summarize the values of `n`, `d`, and the final result calculated from the print statement. 

Output State: **`n` is the absolute value of an input integer; `d` is calculated as int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2)); final result is [[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d.**
