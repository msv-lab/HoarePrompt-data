The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's analyze the program and compare it to the problem requirements:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Jack starts at position 0 and wishes to reach position `x` on a number line.
   - He can jump in either direction, and the length of each subsequent jump increases by 1 unit.
   - The task is to determine the minimal number of jumps required for Jack to reach exactly position `x`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer `x` and computes `n` as the absolute value of `x`.
   - It uses a formula involving `ceil` and `sqrt` to calculate `d`, which seems intended to determine the number of jumps.
   - The final output adds some values based on the parity of `n` and `d`, which is not straightforwardly related to the problem of calculating minimum jumps to reach `x`.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The use of a formula based on quadratic equations is not justified in the context of the problem. The logic does not account for the fact that Jack can jump in both directions, which affects the number of jumps needed to reach `x`.
   - The specific output values derived from the list indexing with `n % 2` and `d % 4` appear arbitrary and do not correspond to the actual jumping strategy required to reach `x`.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - For example, if `x = 2`, Jack can reach it in 3 jumps: jump right 1 (to 1), jump left 2 (to -1), and then jump right 3 (to 2). The program produces 3, which is correct in this case but relies on incorrect calculations.
   - However, for larger values of `x`, the calculations can easily fail to yield the correct minimum jumps. For example, if `x = 3`, the required jumps can be 2 (right 1, right 2) but the program logic may produce an incorrect output due to its flawed calculation method.

Given these points, the program does not consistently meet the requirements for all possible inputs as described in the problem. 

Correctness: **False**
