You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Jack is working on his jumping skills recently. Currently he's located at point zero of the number line. He would like to get to the point x. In order to train, he has decided that he'll first jump by only one unit, and each subsequent jump will be exactly one longer than the previous one. He can go either left or right with each jump. He wonders how many jumps he needs to reach x.

Input

The input data consists of only one integer x ( - 109 ≤ x ≤ 109).

Output

Output the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = abs(input())
    d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
    print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer input from the user, calculates a value based on the input using a mathematical formula involving square roots and modular arithmetic, and prints a result based on that calculation. However, the code does not handle errors for invalid input, such as non-integer values or out-of-bounds integers. Additionally, the use of `print` with incorrect brackets may lead to a syntax error. Overall, the function is intended to compute and output a derived value based on the input integer but lacks proper input validation and error handling.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
