The function reads an integer `n` from input and generates a list of integers based on the value of `n`. If `n` is between 1 and 10, it creates a list of the first `n` integers in descending order. If `n` is between 11 and 100, it appends a calculated value based on `n` and then fills the list with the largest integers down to 1 until the list has 10 elements. If `n` is between 101 and 1000, it performs similar operations but may stop early based on the length of the list being equal to `n % 10 + 2`. If `n` is between 1001 and 10000, it forces `n` to be 10000 and fills the list accordingly. If `n` is between 10001 and 100000, it forces `n` to be 100000 and behaves similarly. The function then prints the total change (which can vary based on the input) and the length of the list, followed by the elements of the list. The function does not accept any parameters and always produces output based on the generated values.
