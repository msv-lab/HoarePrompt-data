According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `x`, which starts at 999999 and decrements until it reaches 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will decrement to 999998. The loop will continue executing as long as `x` is greater than 0.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1 and `res_`, `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`, `nom` now contains the integer 999999, for the loop to execute a second time `x` is 999998.**
