The variable `res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is 100000, we first calculate `n % 10`, which is 0. Therefore, `res` becomes `100000 - 0 - 1`, which equals `99999`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is equal to 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; the output of the print statement is "1 9"; `res` is 99999.
