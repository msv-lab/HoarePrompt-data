To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided initial state and the loop code.

The loop iterates from 999,999 down to 1, appending the current value of `x` to the list `nom` until the length of `nom` equals `n`. Given that `n` is at most 10, the loop will append values to `nom` until it contains `n` elements. Since it starts with one element (the integer 1), it needs to append `n - 1` additional integers.

After the loop completes:
- `nom` will contain 1 followed by the largest `n-1` integers starting from 1,000,000 downwards.
- Because `n` can be at most 10, and given that it starts with the integer 1, the final `nom` list will contain:
  - The number 1 
  - The largest integers from 1,000,000 down to a minimum of 1,000,001 - `n` (for example, if `n` is 10, it will append 1,000,000, 999,999, ..., down to 999,992).

Thus, the output state reflects that `nom` has the first `n` integers starting from 1,000,000 down to 1,000,001 - `n`, plus the initial value of 1. The final length of `nom` will be exactly `n`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers starting from 1 down to (1,000,001 - n), and `x` will be less than or equal to 999,999.**
