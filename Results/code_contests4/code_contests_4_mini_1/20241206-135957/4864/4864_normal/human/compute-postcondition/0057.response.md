According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over a range from 999999 down to 1. The variable `x` is currently 999998 at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be decreased by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `x` is 999998, the next value for `x` will be 999997. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be updated to 999997.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_, 999999, 999998]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is between approximately 1001 and 10989; `x` is 999997.**
