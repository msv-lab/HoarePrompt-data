The loop runs until the length of the `nom` list reaches either 10 or `n % 10 + 2`, which is `2` in this case since `n` is `10000`. Given the initial state of `nom` as `[1, 1]`, the length starts at `2`. 

The loop will execute as follows:
- After the first iteration, `x` will be `999999`, and `nom` becomes `[1, 1, 999999]` (length 3).
- After the second iteration, `x` will be `999998`, and `nom` becomes `[1, 1, 999999, 999998]` (length 4).
- After the third iteration, `x` will be `999997`, and `nom` becomes `[1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997]` (length 5).
- After the fourth iteration, `x` will be `999996`, and `nom` becomes `[1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996]` (length 6).
- After the fifth iteration, `x` will be `999995`, and `nom` becomes `[1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995]` (length 7).
- After the sixth iteration, `x` will be `999994`, and `nom` becomes `[1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994]` (length 8).
- After the seventh iteration, `x` will be `999993`, and `nom` becomes `[1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993]` (length 9).
- After the eighth iteration, `x` will be `999992`, and `nom` becomes `[1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992]` (length 10).

At this point, the length of `nom` is 10, which satisfies the first break condition, so the loop will terminate.

The final output state will therefore include:
- `A` remains a single integer such that `1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5`.
- `n` remains `10000`.
- `change` remains `10000`.
- `nom` will be a list containing `[1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992]`.
- The printed output remains `'10000 2'`.
- `res` remains `9999`.
- `res_` remains `1`.
- `x` will be `999992` after the last iteration.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999992.**
