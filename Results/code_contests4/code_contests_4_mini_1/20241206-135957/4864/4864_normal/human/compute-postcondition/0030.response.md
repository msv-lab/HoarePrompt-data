Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1 and 999999, `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`, `nom` now contains the integer 999999, for the loop to execute a second time `x` is 999998. If the length of `nom` is 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop.***
