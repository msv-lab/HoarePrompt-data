The variable `change` is assigned the value `1000000`. The values of `A` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is assigned the value of int(sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')); `change` is 1000000.
