According to the code, the loop is set to execute for `x` ranging from `999999` down to `1`. The current state indicates that `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, and `res_` are all defined, but their values do not directly affect the execution of the loop since the loop's range is independent.

The loop will execute regardless of the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, and `res_`, as long as the loop is properly defined. Thus, the necessary state for the loop to execute is simply that `x` will take on the values from `999999` down to `1`.

However, since the printed output is '10000 2', it indicates some relationship between `n` and the loop or its body, but it does not change the conditions required for the loop itself to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop needs to reflect the current value of `x` when the loop starts, which will be `999999`. 

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999**
