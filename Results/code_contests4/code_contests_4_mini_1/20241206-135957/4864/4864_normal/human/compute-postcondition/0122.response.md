The value of `x` is 999998, and we are appending this value to the list `nom`. The previous state of `nom` indicates it has either 11 elements or 3 elements. The operation does not affect the other variables directly. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `nom` after appending the value of `x`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains either 12 elements or 4 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999998, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
