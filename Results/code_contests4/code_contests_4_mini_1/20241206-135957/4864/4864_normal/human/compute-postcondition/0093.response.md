Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, 999998], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999997. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
