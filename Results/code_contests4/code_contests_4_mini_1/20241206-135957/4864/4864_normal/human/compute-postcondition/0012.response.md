`nom` is modified by appending the value of `x`, which is 1000000. As a result, the length of `nom` will now be increased by 1. The previous length of `nom` was 2 (containing the integers 1 and 1000000), so after the operation, `nom` will have 3 elements. The variable `n` is less than or equal to 10, and since the new length of `nom` (3) is still less than or equal to `n`, the program does not break out of the most internal loop. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nom`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, and 1000000, `x` is 1000000, and the length of `nom` is 3.**
