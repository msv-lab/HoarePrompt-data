The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains either 12 elements or 4 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999997 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
