The code appends the value of `res_` to the list `nom`. The previous value of `nom` is `[1]`, and `res_` is calculated as `change // res`, where `change` is `1000000` and `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is between `101` and `1000`, the value of `res` will also be between `91` and `999`. Therefore, `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`, which will yield a value between approximately `1001` and `10989`.

Since `res_` is appended to `nom`, the updated state of `nom` will include the new value while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is between approximately 1001 and 10989.**
