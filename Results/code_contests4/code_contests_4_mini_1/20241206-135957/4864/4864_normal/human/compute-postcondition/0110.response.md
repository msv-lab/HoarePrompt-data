The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` is a list of integers with 10 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999999, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
