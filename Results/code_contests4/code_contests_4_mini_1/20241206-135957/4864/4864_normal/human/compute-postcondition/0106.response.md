`res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`. The values of `change` and `res` are 100000 and 99999, respectively. Performing the integer division gives us `res_ = 100000 // 99999`, which results in `res_` being 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is equal to 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; the output of the print statement is "1 9"; `res` is 99999; `res_` is 1.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is equal to 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; the output of the print statement is "1 9"; `res` is 99999; `res_` is 1.**
