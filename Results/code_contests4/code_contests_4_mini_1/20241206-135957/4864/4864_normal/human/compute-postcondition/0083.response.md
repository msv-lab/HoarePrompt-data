`nom` is a list that currently contains two elements: `[1, 1]`. The code appends the value of `x`, which is `999999`, to the list `nom`. After this operation, `nom` will contain three elements: `[1, 1, 999999]`. The length of `nom` is not equal to 10 or 12, so there is no break from any loop or if statement. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999**
