The variable `res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000, we can denote `n` as some integer within that range. The calculation involves finding `n % 10`, which gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, effectively isolating the last digit of `n`. Subtracting this remainder from `n` gives us the largest integer less than or equal to `n` that is also a multiple of 10. By subtracting 1 from this result, we get the largest integer less than that multiple of 10.

Therefore, the output state is dependent on the value of `n`, but we can summarize it as follows:

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`.**
