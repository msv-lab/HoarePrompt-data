Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is between 1000 and 10000 inclusive, then `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` becomes [1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999992. If `n` is between 10001 and 100000 inclusive, then `n` is set to 100000, `change` is updated to 100000, `nom` contains 2 elements, the output is "1 9", `res` is 99999, and `res_` is 1. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
