According to the code, the for loop will execute a fixed number of times, specifically for each integer value of `x` from 1000000 down to 1. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, and `nom`, since the loop's execution is determined solely by the range specified.

Before the loop starts, the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, and `nom` do not affect the execution of the loop. However, we need to consider the initial value of `x`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be initialized to 1000000, which is the starting point of the loop. The loop will decrement `x` until it reaches 1.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, `x` is 1000000**
