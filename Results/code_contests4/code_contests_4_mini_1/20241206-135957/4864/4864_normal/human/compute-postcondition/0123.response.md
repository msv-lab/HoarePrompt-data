According to the code, the loop executes as long as `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999998. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be decremented by 1, resulting in `x` becoming 999997. Since the loop condition checks if `x` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains either 12 elements or 4 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999997, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be greater than 0**
