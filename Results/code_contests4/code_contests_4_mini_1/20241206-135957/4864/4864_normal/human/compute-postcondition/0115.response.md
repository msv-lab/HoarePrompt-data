Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` is either a list of integers with 10 elements or [1, 1]. The output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999999. If the length of `nom` is 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `nom` is not equal to 10 and equals 2, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
