Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1, 999999, and 999998, `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`, and the length of `nom` is not 10. If the length of `nom` were to equal 10, the loop would break out, but since it does not, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop. The condition for the loop to execute a second time is that `x` must be 999997.***
