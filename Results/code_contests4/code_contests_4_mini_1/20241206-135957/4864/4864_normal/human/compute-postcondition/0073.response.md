`res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`. The value of `change` is 10000 and the value of `res` is 9999, so `res_` is calculated as 10000 // 9999, which equals 1 (integer division). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; the printed output is '10000 2'; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; the printed output is '10000 2'; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1**.
