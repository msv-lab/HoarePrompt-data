According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999998. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be decreased by 1, resulting in `x` becoming 999997. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, 999998], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999997 for the loop to execute a second time.**
