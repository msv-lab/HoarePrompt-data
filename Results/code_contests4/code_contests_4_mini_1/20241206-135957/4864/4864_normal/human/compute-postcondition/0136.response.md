The code takes the list `nom`, which contains 2 elements, and applies the `map` function to convert each element to a string. It then joins these string elements with a space in between and prints the result. The variable `change` is not affected by the code execution. The output will be the string representation of the elements in `nom` separated by spaces.

Output State: **`change` is 100000; `nom` contains 2 elements, and their string representation is printed joined by a space.**
