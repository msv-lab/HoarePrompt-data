According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the range specified in `range(1000000 - 1, 0, -1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as the starting value (999999) is greater than the ending value (0) with a step of -1. 

The initial state shows that `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, and `res_` are set, but the loop does not depend on these variables directly for its execution. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, or `res_`, as long as the range parameters are correctly set. 

Thus, there is no need to adjust any of the states because the loop will execute based on its defined range. The initial values of the variables do not affect the ability for the loop to run; they are independent.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1 and `res_`, `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`, for the loop to execute the first time `x` starts at 999999 and decrements until 1**
