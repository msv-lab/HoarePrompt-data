The variable `nom` is being modified by appending the value of `x`, which is 999999. The previous state of `nom` is either a list with 10 elements or [1, 1]. If `nom` has 10 elements, we will break out of the loop, and if it has only 2 elements, we will also break out of the loop. 

Since the operation `nom.append(x)` is performed, the length of `nom` will increase by 1, making it either 11 elements (if it was originally 10) or 3 elements (if it was originally 2). In either case, the length of `nom` will not remain within the conditions that allow for further processing (i.e., equal to 10 or equal to 2), hence we will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` now contains 11 elements if it was originally 10 or 3 elements if it was originally [1, 1]; the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` now contains 11 elements or 3 elements; the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
