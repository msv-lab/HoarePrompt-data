According to the code, the for loop is set to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999999, meaning that the loop can execute again. After the current iteration, `x` will be decreased by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be adjusted to 999998. The other variables in the state do not affect the execution of this specific loop. 

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` now contains 11 elements or 3 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999998, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be greater than 0.**
