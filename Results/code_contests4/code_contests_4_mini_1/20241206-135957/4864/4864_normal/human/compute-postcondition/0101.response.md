The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `change` (which is 100000) with a space and the string representation of the integer `2`. This does not affect the existing variables, and the output will simply display the concatenated result.

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; `n` is greater than 10000 and less than or equal to 100000; the output of the print statement is "100000 2".
