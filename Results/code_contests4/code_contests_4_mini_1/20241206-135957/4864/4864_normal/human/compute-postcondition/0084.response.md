According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 0. The loop starts with `x` initialized to `999999` and decrements `x` by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `999999`, which means the loop can execute again as long as `x` remains greater than 0. 

After the current iteration, `x` will be decremented by 1, so it will become `999998`. The loop will continue executing until `x` reaches `0`.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999998, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be greater than 0**
