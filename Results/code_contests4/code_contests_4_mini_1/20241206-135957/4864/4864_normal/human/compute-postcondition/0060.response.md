Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_, 999999, 999998]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is between approximately 1001 and 10989; `x` is 999997. If the length of `nom` equals `n % 10 + 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the flow continues without any specified action since there is no else part.***
