The value of `change` is assigned the value 10000, replacing its previous value of 1000000. The other variables (`A`, `n`, and `nom`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1].

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]**
