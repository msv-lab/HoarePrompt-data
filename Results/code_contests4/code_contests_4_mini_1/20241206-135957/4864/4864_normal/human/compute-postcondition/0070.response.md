The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without altering any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, but we acknowledge that the program is terminating.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; printed output is '10000 2' and the program is terminating.**
