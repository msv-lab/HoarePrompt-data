`nom` is updated by appending the value of `res_`, which is 1. Therefore, after this operation, `nom` becomes [1, 1]. The other variables remain unchanged. The Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is equal to 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1, 1]; the output of the print statement is "1 9"; `res` is 99999; `res_` is 1.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is equal to 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1, 1]; the output of the print statement is "1 9"; `res` is 99999; `res_` is 1.**
