According to the code, the loop iterates from 999999 down to 1. The variable `x` starts at 1000000 and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` would be 1, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `x` would need to be decremented again, but since `x` is already at its minimum value of 1, it will not execute again. 

Additionally, the loop will terminate when reaching the end of the specified range, which aligns with the current state. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we would need `x` to be reset to a value greater than 1, but since the range is already defined from 1000000 to 1, it cannot.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1 and 1000000, `x` is 1000000, for the loop to execute again x must be reset to a value greater than 1.**
