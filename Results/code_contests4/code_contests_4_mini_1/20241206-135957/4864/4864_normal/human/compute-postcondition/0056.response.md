The code `nom.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `nom`. Given the initial state, `x` is `999998`, and `nom` is `[1, res_, 999999]`. The length of `nom` is currently 3, which does not equal 10 and also does not equal `n % 10 + 2`. Therefore, neither of the conditions for modifying the length of `nom` are met. The only action taken is appending `x` to `nom`.

After executing the code, `nom` will be updated to include `999998`. The output state reflects the updated value of `nom`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_, 999999, 999998]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is between approximately 1001 and 10989; `x` is 999998.**
