To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let’s analyze the initial state and the code line by line.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100.
   - `change` is 1000000.
   - `nom` is a list containing the integer 1.
   - `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`.
   - `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The line `nom.append(res_)` takes the value of `res_` (which is determined by the calculation of `res`) and appends it to the list `nom`.

3. **Calculating the Values**:
   - Since `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`, it will be the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n`.
   - `res_` is then calculated as `1000000 // res`, which means it’s the result of dividing 1000000 by the value of `res`.

4. **Impact on `nom`**:
   - The value of `res_` is appended to the list `nom`. This modifies `nom`, which was initially `[1]`.

5. **Output State**:
   - The list `nom` now contains its previous value `[1]` plus the new value `res_`. 

So the output state will reflect the updated list `nom` with the appended value.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing the integers 1 and `res_`; `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`.**
