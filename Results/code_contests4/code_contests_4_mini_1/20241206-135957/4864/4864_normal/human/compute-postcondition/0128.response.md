`nom` is modified by appending the value of `x`, which is 999997, to it. Since the initial state indicates that `nom` contains either 12 elements or 4 elements, appending `x` does not affect the length constraints that lead to breaking out of the most internal loop. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nom` and the unchanged state of other variables.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains either 13 elements or 5 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999997.**
