Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains either 12 elements or 4 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999997. If the length of `nom` is 10, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
