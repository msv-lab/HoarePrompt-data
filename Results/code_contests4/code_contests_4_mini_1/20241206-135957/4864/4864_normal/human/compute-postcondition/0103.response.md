The `exit(0)` command is a function that terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change due to this command, but the program stops execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; the output of the print statement is "1 9", and the program has exited.
