According to the code, the loop is set to execute as long as the variable `x` decreases from 999999 down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `x` will have decreased by 1, so now `x` is 999998. The loop will execute again as long as `x` is still greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999998, which is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` will be decremented to 999997.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is now a list containing the integers 1, 999999, and 999998, `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`, the length of `nom` is not 10, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be 999997.**
