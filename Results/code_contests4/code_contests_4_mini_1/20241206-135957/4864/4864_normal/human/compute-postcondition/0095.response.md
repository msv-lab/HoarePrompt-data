`nom` is updated by appending the value of `x`, which is 999997. The list `nom` previously contained the values [1, 1, 999999, 999998]. After appending, `nom` will now be [1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997]. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999997.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, 999998, 999997], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999997.**
