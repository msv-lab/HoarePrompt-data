According to the code, the loop is designed to execute in reverse from 1000000 down to 1. The variable `x` starts at 1000000 and decreases by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `x` would be 1000000 - 1 = 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to decrease to 999998. 

Additionally, the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0. Given that `x` is currently 999999, it is still greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, and 1000000, `x` is 999998, and the length of `nom` is 3.**
