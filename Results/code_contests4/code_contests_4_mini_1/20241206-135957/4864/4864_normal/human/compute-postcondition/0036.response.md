The loop continues appending values to the `nom` list starting from 999999 down to 1 until the length of `nom` reaches 10. Given that `nom` initially contains the integers 1 and `res_`, the loop will append values until it contains a total of 10 integers.

Since `nom` starts with two integers (1 and `res_`), the loop will execute 8 more times to reach a length of 10. After all iterations of the loop finish, `nom` will contain a total of 10 integers.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed will be:

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1, `res_`, and the 8 largest integers from 999999 down to 999992, `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`.**
