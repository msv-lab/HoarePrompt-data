The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is now a list containing the integers 1, 999999, and 999998, `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, `res_` is calculated as `1000000 // res`, the length of `nom` is not 10, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be 999997 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
