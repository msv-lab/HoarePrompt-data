To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we analyze the conditions inside the loop and how they affect the `nom` list and other variables.

1. The loop runs from 999999 down to 1.
2. The loop contains two `break` conditions:
   - If the length of `nom` is 10, the loop breaks.
   - If the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, which evaluates to 2 in this case (since `n` is 100000, `n % 10` is 0).
3. The initial `nom` list has 2 elements (1, 1), thus the second condition will trigger as soon as the length of `nom` reaches 2.

Given that the initial length of `nom` is 2, the loop will not execute even once because the second condition (length of `nom` equal to 2) is already satisfied. Therefore, the loop will not append any values to the `nom` list.

After all iterations of the loop (which do not execute), the state of the variables remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` contains 2 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1.**
