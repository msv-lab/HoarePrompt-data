`nom` is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, and 1000000. The code appends the value of `x`, which is 999998, to the list `nom`. After this operation, the list `nom` will contain four integers: 1, 1000000, 1000000, and 999998. The length of `nom` will now be 4, which does not equal `n` (which is less than or equal to 10). Therefore, the condition regarding breaking out of the loop does not apply.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, 1000000, 999998, and the length of `nom` is 4.**
