Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, if `n` is between 10001 and 100000 inclusive, then `n` is set to 100000, `change` is updated to 100000, `nom` contains 2 elements, the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, and `res_` is 1. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
