Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999. If the length of `nom` is 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, and if it is equal to 12, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
