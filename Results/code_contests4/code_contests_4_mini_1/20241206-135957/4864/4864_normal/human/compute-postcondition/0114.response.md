Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 100000, `nom` is [1, 1], the output of the print statement is "1 9", `res` is 99999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999, the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, if the length of `nom` is equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
