The variable `res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`. The value of `change` is 1000000, and `res` is defined as `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000, `res` will be a value between 99 and 999. 

To find `res_`, we need to compute the value of `res`. 

- Since `n` is between 100 and 1000, let's assume `n` is 100 for the minimum case:
  - `res = 100 - 100 % 10 - 1 = 100 - 0 - 1 = 99`
- For the maximum case where `n` is 1000:
  - `res = 1000 - 1000 % 10 - 1 = 1000 - 0 - 1 = 999`

Now we can compute `res_` for both extremes:

1. When `res` is 99:
   - `res_ = 1000000 // 99 = 10101` (approximately)
   
2. When `res` is 999:
   - `res_ = 1000000 // 999 = 1001` (approximately)

Thus, `res_` will take on values ranging from approximately 10101 to 1001 depending on the value of `n`.

Since `res` could vary depending on the specific value of `n` within the given range, we state that `res_` will be calculated based on the final value of `res`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is `change // res` which is between approximately 10101 and 1001 based on the value of `n`.**
