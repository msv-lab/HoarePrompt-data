The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999], printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999998 and we break out of the most internal loop.
