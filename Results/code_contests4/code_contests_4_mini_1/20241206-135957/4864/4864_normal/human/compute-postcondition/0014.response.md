The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integers 1, 1000000, and 1000000, `x` is 999998, and the length of `nom` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
