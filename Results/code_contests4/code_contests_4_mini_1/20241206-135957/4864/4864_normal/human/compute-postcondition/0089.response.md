The variable `x` is 999998, and we append this value to the list `nom`. The previous value of `nom` is [1, 1, 999999]. After appending `x`, the new value of `nom` becomes [1, 1, 999999, 999998]. The length of `nom` is now 4, which does not trigger any breaks from the loop conditions based on the given initial state. The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1, 999999, 999998], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999998.**
