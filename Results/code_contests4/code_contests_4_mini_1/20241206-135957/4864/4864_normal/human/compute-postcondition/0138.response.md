The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Upon execution, it returns two integers, `N` and `M`, where `N` is within the range of 1 to 10^6, and `M` is within the range of 1 to 10. Additionally, it returns a list of `M` distinct integers, `D1, D2, ..., DM`, where each integer `Di` is within the range of 1 to 10^6. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to generate and return two integers, `N` and `M`, followed by `M` distinct integers within specified ranges. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns two integers N and M, followed by M distinct integers, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ M ≤ 10, and 1 ≤ Di ≤ 10^6 for each distinct integer Di.**
