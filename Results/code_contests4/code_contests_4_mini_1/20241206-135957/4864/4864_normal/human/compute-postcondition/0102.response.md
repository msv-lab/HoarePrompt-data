The code executes a print statement that concatenates the string representation of the integers 1 and 9, separated by a space. The previous states of the variables `A`, `n`, `change`, and `nom` are not affected by this print statement. 

The output of the print statement is "1 9".

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; `n` is greater than 10000 and less than or equal to 100000; the output of the print statement is "1 9".**
