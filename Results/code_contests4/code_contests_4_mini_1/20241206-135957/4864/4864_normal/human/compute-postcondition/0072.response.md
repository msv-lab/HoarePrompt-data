The value of `res` is assigned the calculation `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is 10000, we compute the following:

1. `n % 10` gives us the remainder when 10000 is divided by 10, which is 0.
2. Thus, `n - n % 10` becomes `10000 - 0 = 10000`.
3. Finally, we subtract 1: `10000 - 1 = 9999`.

The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; the printed output is '10000 2'; `res` is 9999.
