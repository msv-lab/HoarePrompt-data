The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1], the printed output is '10000 2', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999, the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, and the length of `nom` is equal to 12 (since 12 is the result of 10000 % 10 + 2) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
