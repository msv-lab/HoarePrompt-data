The code `nom.append(res_)` appends the value of `res_` to the list `nom`. The previous value of `res_` is 1, so after execution, `nom` will now contain the value 1 in addition to its previous value, which was [1]. Therefore, `nom` will become [1, 1]. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1]; the printed output is '10000 2'; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1**
