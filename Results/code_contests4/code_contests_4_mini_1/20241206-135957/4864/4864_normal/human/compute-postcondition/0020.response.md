The variable `res` is assigned the value of the expression `n - n % 10 - 1`. The previous value of `n` is not specified but is known to be an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100. The expression calculates the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n` and then subtracts 1 from it. Therefore, the output state reflects the dependency of `res` on the specific value of `n`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing the integer 1; `res` is calculated as n - n % 10 - 1.**
