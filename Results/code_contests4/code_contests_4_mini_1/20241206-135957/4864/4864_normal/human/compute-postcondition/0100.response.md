The value of `change` is assigned the value 100000. The previous value of `change` was 1000000, so after execution, `change` is now 100000. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is assigned a value of 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; and `n` is greater than 10000 and less than or equal to 100000.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is assigned a value of 100000; `change` is 100000; `nom` is [1]; and `n` is greater than 10000 and less than or equal to 100000.**
