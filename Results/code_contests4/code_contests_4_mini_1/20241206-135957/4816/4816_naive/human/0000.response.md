To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem description:
Polycarpus has watched all episodes except for one in a season of a sitcom. The task is to determine which episode he hasn't watched, given the total number of episodes `n` and a list of `n-1` watched episodes.

### Program code:
```python
def func_1(N, NUMBERS):
    n = int(N)
    numbers = [int(s) for s in NUMBERS.split(' ')]
    assert n + 0 == len(numbers) + 1
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
    sys.stdout.write(str(int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if True:
        n = raw_input()
        numbers = raw_input()
        func_1(n, numbers)
    else:
        func_1('10', '3 8 10 1 7 9 6 5 2')
    sys.exit(0)
```

### Analysis of the code:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads `n` and the watched episodes from input. This is fine but note that `raw_input()` is for Python 2, which may not work in Python 3.

2. **Sum Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the sum of all watched episodes and then computes the missing episode by using the formula for the sum of the first `n` integers. This approach is correct:
     \[
     \text{missing} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - \text{sum of watched}
     \]
   - This method correctly identifies the missing episode as long as all watched episodes are unique and in the range [1, n].

3. **Assertion Check**:
   - The assertion `assert n + 0 == len(numbers) + 1` checks that the number of episodes watched is exactly `n - 1`. This is unnecessary since the problem guarantees that `n` and the watched episodes will always satisfy this condition.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program assumes that the input will always conform to the specified ranges. For instance, if `n` is `2`, the program will expect exactly one number for the watched episode, which is valid, but it doesn't explicitly handle invalid input or edge cases like duplicates or numbers out of range.
   - The use of `raw_input()` indicates the code is intended for Python 2, which may cause issues if run in a Python 3 environment.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input is malformed or includes duplicates, the program does not handle these cases and will produce incorrect results or errors.

### Conclusion:
While the main logic for finding the missing episode appears correct, the program lacks robust input validation and relies on assumptions that may not always hold true. Given the potential for incorrect behavior with unexpected inputs, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The program does not handle edge cases such as input validation and assumes unique, valid episode numbers. Therefore, it may fail in situations that do not meet these assumptions. For example, if the input had duplicates or numbers outside the range [1, n], the program would not function correctly.
