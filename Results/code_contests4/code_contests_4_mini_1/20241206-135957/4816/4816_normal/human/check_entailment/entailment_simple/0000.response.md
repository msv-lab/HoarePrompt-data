To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze what the program is supposed to do and how it achieves that.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem is to find out which episode Polycarpus has not watched from a total of `n` episodes, given that he has watched `n - 1` episodes. The episodes are numbered from 1 to n, and the watched episodes are provided as a list.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function takes two arguments: `N`, which is the total number of episodes, and `NUMBERS`, which is a string of space-separated integers that represent the episodes watched.

2. **Conversion**:
   - The function converts `N` to an integer and splits the `NUMBERS` string into a list of integers called `numbers`.

3. **Summation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the watched episodes stored in `numbers`.

4. **Finding the Unwatched Episode**:
   - The program computes the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - It then finds the unwatched episode by subtracting the sum of the watched episodes from the expected sum.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the result is printed.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The calculations performed in the program are mathematically sound:
  - The formula for the sum of the first `n` integers is correct.
  - By subtracting the sum of watched episodes from this expected sum, the program will yield the unwatched episode, which aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.

- The program handles the input constraints well:
  - It assumes valid input as per the problem description (i.e., all watched episodes are distinct and within the specified range).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to find the unwatched episode based on the given problem description. Therefore, it meets the requirements stated.

Correctness: **True**
