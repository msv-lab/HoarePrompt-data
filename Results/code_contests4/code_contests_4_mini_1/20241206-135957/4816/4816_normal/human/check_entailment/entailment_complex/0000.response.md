Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `N` (the total number of episodes) and `NUMBERS` (a string representation of the episodes that have been watched). The first line of input, `N`, is guaranteed to be in the range 2 to 100,000, which aligns with the problem constraints. The second line contains `N-1` distinct integers that represent the episodes watched.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the watched episodes correctly. It uses a loop to iterate through each number in `numbers` (which is derived from splitting the `NUMBERS` string), accumulating the total in the variable `sum`.

3. **Finding the Missing Episode**: To find the missing episode, the program uses the formula for the sum of the first `N` integers, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. It subtracts the sum of the watched episodes from this total sum, thus identifying the missing episode. This step is mathematically sound and ensures that the correct episode number is outputted.

4. **Output**: The output is written to standard output as specified, which is the missing episode number.

5. **Uniqueness and Range**: According to the problem constraints, the watched episodes are distinct and fall within the range of 1 to N. The program correctly assumes and enforces that if `NUMBERS` does not contain exactly `N-1` distinct integers, the behavior is undefined. However, given the problem's precondition that this format will always be provided, this aspect does not affect correctness.

In conclusion, all aspects of the program align with the problem description, ensuring it works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
