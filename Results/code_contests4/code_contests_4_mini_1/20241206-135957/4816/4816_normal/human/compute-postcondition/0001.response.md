`numbers` is assigned a list of integers created by converting each element in `NUMBERS` (a space-separated string) into an integer. `n` is equal to `N`, and `NUMBERS` contains `n - 1` distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Since `NUMBERS` is defined as having `n - 1` elements, `numbers` will be a list of these `n - 1` integers.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000; `n` is equal to N; `numbers` is a list of `n - 1` distinct integers converted from `NUMBERS`.**
