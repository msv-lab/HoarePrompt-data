The variable `sum` is incremented by the value of `num`. The initial value of `sum` is equal to `num`, which is the second element in the `numbers` list. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `sum` will be `num + num`, which simplifies to `2 * num`. The values of `N`, `n`, and `numbers` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `numbers` is a list of `n - 1` distinct integers, `sum` is equal to `2 * num`, `num` is the second element in `numbers`.**
