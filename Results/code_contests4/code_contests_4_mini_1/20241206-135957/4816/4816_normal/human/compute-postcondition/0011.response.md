The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `N` and `NUMBERS`. The parameter `N` is an integer that satisfies the constraint \(2 \leq N \leq 100000\). The parameter `NUMBERS` is a list containing \(N - 1\) distinct integers, with each integer falling within the range of 1 to \(N\). Based on the output, the function returns the integer that is missing from the range 1 to \(N\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `N` and a list of distinct integers `NUMBERS`, and return the integer that is not present in the list but should be within the range from 1 to \(N\). 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N and a list of N-1 distinct integers NUMBERS, returning the missing integer from the range 1 to N.**
