According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will iterate over the elements within the `numbers` list. Since `n` is equal to `N` and `numbers` is a list of `n - 1` distinct integers, this means that `numbers` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Given that `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 100000\), it follows that `n`, which is equal to `N`, will be at least 2. Therefore, `numbers` being a list of `n - 1` distinct integers implies that `numbers` must contain at least one integer (because \(n - 1 \geq 1\) when \(N \geq 2\)). 

At the start of the loop, `sum` is initialized to 0. The first iteration of the loop will access the first element of `numbers`, which we can denote as `num`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `numbers` is not empty and that we can start iterating from the first element.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `numbers` is a list of `n - 1` distinct integers (which contains at least 1 element), `sum` is 0, `num` is the first element in `numbers**
