The value of `sum` is incremented by `num`. Since `sum` is equal to `2 * num`, after the execution, `sum` will be `2 * num + num`, which simplifies to `3 * num`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `numbers` is a list of `n - 1` distinct integers, `sum` is equal to `3 * num`, `num` is the third element in `numbers`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `numbers` is a list of `n - 1` distinct integers, `sum` is equal to `3 * num`, `num` is the third element in `numbers**
