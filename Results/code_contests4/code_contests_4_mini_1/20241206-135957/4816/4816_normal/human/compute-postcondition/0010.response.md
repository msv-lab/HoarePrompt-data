The code calculates the missing number from a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is equal to `N` and `numbers` contains `n - 1` distinct integers. The value of `sum` represents the sum of all integers in the list `numbers`.

The expression `int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)` computes the expected sum of the first `n` integers and subtracts the sum of the integers present in the list `numbers`. The result gives the missing integer from that range.

Since `N` is an integer such that `2 ≤ N ≤ 100000`, `n` is equal to `N`, and `sum` is the sum of all elements in `numbers`, the output will directly reflect the calculation based on these values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `numbers` is a list of `n - 1` distinct integers, `sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `numbers`, and the missing number is calculated as int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)**.
