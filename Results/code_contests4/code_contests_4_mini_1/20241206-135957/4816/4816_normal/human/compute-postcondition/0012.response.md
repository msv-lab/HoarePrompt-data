Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer N (where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and a string NUMBERS containing N-1 distinct integers separated by spaces. It calculates the sum of the integers in NUMBERS and determines the missing integer from the range 1 to N by subtracting this sum from the total sum of the first N integers. The function outputs the missing integer. Note that if NUMBERS does not contain exactly N-1 distinct integers, the function's behavior is undefined. **
