The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(N)`, where `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000. Therefore, the value of `n` will be the same as the value of `N`. The other variable, `NUMBERS`, remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000; `n` is equal to N; `NUMBERS` is a list of n - 1 distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to N.**
