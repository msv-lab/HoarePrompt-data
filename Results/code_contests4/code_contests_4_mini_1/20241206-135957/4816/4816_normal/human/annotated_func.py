#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000, and NUMBERS is a list of n - 1 distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to N.
def func_1(N, NUMBERS):
    n = int(N)
    numbers = [int(s) for s in NUMBERS.split(' ')]
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `numbers` is a list of `n - 1` distinct integers, `sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `numbers`.
    sys.stdout.write(str(int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer N (where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and a string NUMBERS containing N-1 distinct integers separated by spaces. It calculates the sum of the integers in NUMBERS and determines the missing integer from the range 1 to N by subtracting this sum from the total sum of the first N integers. The function outputs the missing integer. Note that if NUMBERS does not contain exactly N-1 distinct integers, the function's behavior is undefined.
