To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Polycarpus has a season of `n` episodes, and he has watched all episodes except one. The input includes:
- An integer `n` representing the total number of episodes.
- A list of `n-1` distinct integers representing the episodes that have been watched.

The task is to identify the one episode that has not been watched.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(N, NUMBERS)` is designed to solve this problem. Here's the breakdown of the important parts:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function takes `N` (total episodes) and `NUMBERS` (watched episodes) as parameters.
   - It converts `N` to an integer and splits `NUMBERS` into a list of integers.

2. **Assertion**:
   - There is an assertion to check if the length of watched episodes is indeed `n - 1`, which is correct.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the watched episodes.
   - It uses the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, to find the expected sum of episode numbers.

4. **Missing Episode Calculation**:
   - The missing episode is calculated by subtracting the sum of watched episodes from the total sum of episodes.

5. **Output**:
   - The result is printed.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Edge Case**: The smallest input where `n = 2`. 
   - Input: 
     ```
     2
     1
     ```
   - Expected output: `2` (since episode 2 is unwatched).
   - The program correctly identifies it.

2. **All Valid Cases**: For a general case like `n = 10` and watched episodes being all but one, the logic holds as the sum calculation will always yield the correct unwatched episode due to the properties of arithmetic sums.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the unwatched episode based on the problem description. It handles the required input format and outputs the expected result.

Thus, I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected, given the constraints and requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
