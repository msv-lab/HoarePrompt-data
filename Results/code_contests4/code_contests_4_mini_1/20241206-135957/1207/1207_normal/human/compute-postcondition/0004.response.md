The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a prime integer such that \(5 \leq n < 10^9\), and a parameter `r`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it will return a value based on the specified conditions related to the parameters. However, the specific return value based on the parameters `n` and `r` is not provided in the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a prime integer `n` and an integer `r`, but the nature of the return value is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, a prime integer where \(5 \leq n < 10^9\), and `r`, an integer where \(1 \leq r \leq 10^9\).**
