The line of code assigns the values obtained from `raw_input()` split into two integers to the variables `n` and `r`. Since `n` is already defined as a prime integer in the given range, it will be overwritten with the new value from input. The variable `r` will also receive a new value from the input. Therefore, both `n` and `r` will be updated with the values provided by the user. 

Output State: **`n` is updated to an input prime integer, `r` is updated to an input integer**
