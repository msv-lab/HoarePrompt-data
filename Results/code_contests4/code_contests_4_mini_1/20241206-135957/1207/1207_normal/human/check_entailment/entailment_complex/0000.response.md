Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the area calculation for the star shape as described in the problem. 

1. **Incorrect Mathematical Formula**: The formula used in the program to calculate the area of the star is not aligned with the mathematical principles needed to find the area of such a star polygon. The expression used in `ans` does not reflect the correct geometry of the star which involves connecting points on the circumference of the circle.

2. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not available in Python 3; it should be `input()`. This would lead to a runtime error if executed in a Python 3 environment.

3. **Missing Libraries**: The program uses `math.sin()` without importing the `math` library, which would cause a NameError.

4. **Output Requirements**: The program does not specify formatting for the output, which could lead to issues with precision as required by the problem. The problem specifies that the relative error should not be greater than \(10^{-7}\), but the program does not seem to enforce or check for that.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description in its current state.
