The provided program intends to compute the area of a star figure with `n` corners and a circumradius `r`. Let's analyze the program step by step and compare it with the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` (the number of corners) and `r` (the radius of the circumcircle). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Mathematical Calculation**: The area of the star is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{n \cdot r^2 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2n}\right)}
   \]
   This formula is consistent with the geometric properties of regular stars formed by connecting points on a circle, where `n` is prime and at least 5. The use of sine functions corresponds to computing the necessary angles involved in the star shape, which is appropriate for the area calculation.

3. **Output**: The result is printed directly, which complies with the requirement to output the area.

4. **Error Handling**: The program does not include explicit error handling or checks for prime status of `n`, but it's stated in the problem description that `n` is guaranteed to be a prime number. Thus, we can assume the input will meet the constraints.

5. **Precision**: The program does not specify how it ensures accuracy to within a relative error of \(10^{-7}\). However, Python's floating-point arithmetic should suffice for this level of precision, given the constraints on `r`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the area calculation for a star-shaped figure based on the provided mathematical formula and adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
