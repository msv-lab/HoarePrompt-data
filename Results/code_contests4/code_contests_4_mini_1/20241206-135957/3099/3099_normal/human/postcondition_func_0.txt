The function accepts a positive integer `a` and a list `b` of positive integers. It creates a new list `c` where each element is the sum of `a` and the corresponding element from `b`. If any element of `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from that element, but it does not affect the other elements of `c`. The function returns the modified list `c`.
