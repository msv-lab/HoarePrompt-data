To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and how it relates to the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program should:
1. Accept an integer \( N \) followed by a list of \( N \) positive integers \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N \).
2. Find positive integers \( B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N \) such that for any \( i, j \) where \( 1 \leq i < j \leq N \), the condition \( A_i B_i = A_j B_j \) holds.
3. Minimize the sum \( B_1 + B_2 + \ldots + B_N \) and return this sum modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Prime Factorization and LCM Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the input list. This is done by prime factorizing each integer and keeping track of the maximum powers of each prime.
   - This step is crucial because the condition \( A_i B_i = A_j B_j \) implies a relationship between the \( A_i \)'s and \( B_i \)'s that can be satisfied by expressing them in terms of their LCM.

2. **Calculation of \( B_i \)**:
   - Each \( B_i \) is essentially calculated as \( \frac{\text{lcm}(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N)}{A_i} \). This ensures that the condition \( A_i B_i = A_j B_j \) holds because \( B_i \) and \( B_j \) are derived from a common LCM.
   - The program correctly computes \( B_i \) for each \( A_i \) in the list.

3. **Summing \( B_i \)**:
   - The program sums all \( B_i \) values through a loop and applies the modulo operation as required.

### Conclusion:
The program effectively implements the required logic as specified in the problem description. It computes the necessary \( B_i \) values based on the LCM of the \( A_i \) values and ensures that the condition \( A_i B_i = A_j B_j \) is adhered to. The final output is correctly computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
