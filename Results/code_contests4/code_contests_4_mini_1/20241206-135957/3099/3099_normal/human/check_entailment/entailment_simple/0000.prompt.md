You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given are N positive integers A_1,...,A_N.

Consider positive integers B_1, ..., B_N that satisfy the following condition.

Condition: For any i, j such that 1 \leq i < j \leq N, A_i B_i = A_j B_j holds.

Find the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for such B_1,...,B_N.

Since the answer can be enormous, print the sum modulo (10^9 +7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^4
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

A_1 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for B_1,...,B_N that satisfy the condition, modulo (10^9 +7).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the number of elements, and b is a list of positive integers A of length a where each element A[i] satisfies 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer representing the number of elements; `b` is a list of positive integers of length `a`; `c` is a list resulting from adding `a` to each element of list `b`. If all elements of `c` are greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is updated to be a list where each element is the result of subtracting `mod` from the original elements of `c`.
    return c
    #The program returns the list 'c', which contains elements resulting from adding 'a' to each element of list 'b'. If all elements of 'c' are greater than or equal to 'mod', 'c' is updated by subtracting 'mod' from each element.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the number of elements N, and b is a list of N positive integers A_1, ..., A_N where 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the product of the positive integer 'a' representing the number of elements and the list 'b' of N positive integers, all taken modulo 'mod'.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of positive integers, and b is a list of length a containing positive integers A_1, ..., A_a where 1 <= a <= 10^4 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i.
def func_3(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1 regardless of the values of a and b
    else :
        if (b % 2 == 1) :
            return func_2(a, func_3(a, b - 1))
            #The program returns the result of func_2 applied to the integer a and the result of func_3 applied to a and the list b with each element decremented by 1. The sum of the elements in b is an odd number, and a is an integer representing the number of positive integers in b.
        else :
            temp = func_3(a, b / 2)
            return func_2(temp, temp)
            #The program returns the result of func_2 called with temp as both arguments, where temp is the value returned by func_3 with parameters a and b divided by 2.

#Function 4:

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
