The function accepts a positive integer `a` and a list `b` containing `N` positive integers. It returns the product of `a` and `b`, but the operation `a * b` is not valid as it attempts to multiply an integer by a list directly. Consequently, this will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the function does not perform as described in the annotations and will raise an error instead of returning a modulo result.
