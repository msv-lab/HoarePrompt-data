The variable `x` is divided by `i`, where `i` is 4. The initial value of `x` is 16. After the operation, `x` will be updated to 16 / 4, which equals 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 4; `cnt` is {2: k, 3: m}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is 4**
