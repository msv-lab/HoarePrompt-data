The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Given that `x` is 3.0 and `i` is 3, after the operation, the new value of `x` becomes 3.0 / 3 = 1.0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `cnt` is {2: k, 3: 1}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is 1.0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `cnt` is {2: k, 3: 1}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is 1.0**
