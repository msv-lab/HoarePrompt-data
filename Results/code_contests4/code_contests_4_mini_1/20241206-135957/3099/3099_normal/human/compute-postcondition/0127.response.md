The statement `cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` updates the dictionary `cnt`. The value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1. The method `get(i, 0)` retrieves the current value for the key `i` in `cnt`, returning 0 if `i` does not exist in `cnt`. Since `x` is less than 2 after being divided by `i`, we do not have any specific values for `cnt` or `i`, but we know that `i` is 9 or greater.

The output state will reflect that the value for `cnt[i]` is increased by 1, but the specific previous value of `cnt[i]` is unknown (it could be 0 or any other number), so we note that it has been updated.

Output State: **`cnt[i]` is updated to `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` for `i` which is 9 or greater, and `x` is less than 2 after being divided by `i`.**
