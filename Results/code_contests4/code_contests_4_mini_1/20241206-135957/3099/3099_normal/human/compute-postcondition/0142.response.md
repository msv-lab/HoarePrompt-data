The variable `cnt[i]` will be assigned a value based on the current value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. Since `i` is 1, we look for `cnt[1]`. The current value of `cnt[1]` is 1, so `cnt.get(1, 0)` returns 1. Therefore, `cnt[i]` becomes `1 + 1`, which is 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is 2.

Output State: **`x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is 2**
