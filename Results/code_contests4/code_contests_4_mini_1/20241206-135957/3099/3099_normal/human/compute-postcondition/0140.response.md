To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `x % i == 0`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is less than 2 (let's denote it as `x < 2`)
- `i` is 1
- `cnt[1]` is 1

Now, we evaluate the condition for the loop:
- The expression `x % i` evaluates to `x % 1`. Since any number modulo 1 equals 0, the condition `x % i == 0` will always be true regardless of the value of `x` as long as `i` is 1.

Since `i` is currently 1, the condition will always hold true for any value of `x`. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute one more time under the current state.

Thus, there is no need to adjust any of the variables because the loop can proceed as it stands. 

State: **`x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is 1**
