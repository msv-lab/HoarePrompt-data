The code `cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` updates the `cnt` dictionary by assigning it a new value for the key `i`. The `get` method retrieves the current value associated with the key `i`, defaulting to `0` if `i` is not already present in the dictionary. Therefore, if `i` was not in `cnt`, it will be added with a value of `1`. If `i` was already in `cnt`, its value will be incremented by `1`.

Since the initial state specifies that `x` is divided by `i` and the new value of `x` is `x/i`, this does not directly affect the `cnt` dictionary or the variable `i`. The impact is only on the `cnt` dictionary.

Output State: **`x` is divided by `i`, `cnt[i]` is updated based on the previous value or set to 1 if `i` was not present**
