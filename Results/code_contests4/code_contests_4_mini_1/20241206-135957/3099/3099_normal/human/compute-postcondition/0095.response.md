Postcondition: ***`x` is reduced to the value of `arr[i]` divided by the product of `i` raised to the power of `cnt[i]` for all prime factors `i` that were counted, `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `arr[0] + 1`, and `cnt` contains the count of prime factors for each `i` that divided `x`. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 1.***
