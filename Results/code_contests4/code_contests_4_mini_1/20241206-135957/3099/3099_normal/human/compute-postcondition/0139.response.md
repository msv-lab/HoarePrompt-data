The value of `cnt[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `cnt` at key `i`. The current value of `i` is 1, so `cnt[1]` is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1`. Since `cnt.get(1, 0)` returns 0 (as `cnt` does not have a value for key 1 yet), `cnt[1]` will be updated to 0 + 1, which results in `cnt[1]` being 1. The states of `x` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is 1**
