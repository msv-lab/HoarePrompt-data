Output State: **`answer` contains the maximum values of each key from the prime factorization of `arr[0]` as stored in `cnt`, where `cnt` is a dictionary that has at least one key, and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[0]`; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4.**
