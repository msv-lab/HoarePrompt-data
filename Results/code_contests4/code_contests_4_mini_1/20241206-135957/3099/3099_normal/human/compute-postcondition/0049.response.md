According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `cnt`. If `cnt` contains at least one key, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` has at least one key from the prime factorization of `arr[0]`, `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[0]`, and `key` is the first key in `cnt`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next key in `cnt`. Assuming there are more keys in `cnt`, the next key will be the second key in the dictionary. 

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `key` is now the second key in `cnt`, but we do not have enough information to determine if there is a second key or not. However, we can assume that for the loop to execute again, `cnt` must still contain at least one key, which it does since it has at least one key currently.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[0]`; `cnt` is a dictionary containing at least one key from the prime factorization of `arr[0]`; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `key` is the second key in `cnt; answer[key] is updated to max(answer.get(key, 0), cnt[key])**
