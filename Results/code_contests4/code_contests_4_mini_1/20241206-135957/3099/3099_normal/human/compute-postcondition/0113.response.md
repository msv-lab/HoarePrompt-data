According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is divisible by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` has been divided by 2, meaning `x` is now `x / 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be divisible by 2.

Thus, `x` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is still even after the previous iteration. This means `x` should be greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`answer` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for each key in `cnt`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than or equal to 2**
