Output State: **`answer` contains the maximum values of each key from the prime factorization of `arr[0]`, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is adjusted to be greater than the square root of `arr[0] + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i`.**
