To determine the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

1. The initial value of `x` is `arr[2] / 2`, but the specific value of `arr[2]` is not provided, so we cannot compute the exact value of `x`. However, we know `x` is based on `arr[2]`.
2. The variable `i` is 2.
3. The operation `x /= i` means `x` is divided by `i` (which is 2), resulting in `x` being updated to `x / 2`.

Since we do not have the actual value of `arr[2]`, we can only express the new value of `x` in terms of its previous value.

Thus, after the execution of the code, the output state reflects that `x` is now half of its previous value, while `i` and `cnt[2]` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `x / 2`, `i` is 2, `cnt[2]` is updated based on its previous value**.
