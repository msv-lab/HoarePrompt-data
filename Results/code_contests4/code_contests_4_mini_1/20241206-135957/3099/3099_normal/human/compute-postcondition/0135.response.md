The value of `x` is divided by `i`, where `i` is 1, so the new value of `x` remains unchanged and is still less than 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `x` remains unchanged after the division.

Output State: **`x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `x` remains unchanged after the division.**
