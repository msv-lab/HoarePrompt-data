To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i * i <= x`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 3.
- `cnt` indicates that `k` is the number of times `arr[0]` is divisible by 2, and since `arr[0]` is at least 4, `x` (which is `arr[0] / 2^k`) will be a value that can only decrease as `k` increases, meaning `x` is still a positive integer.

Given the current value of `i`:
- The condition for the loop, `i * i <= x`, would be evaluated as `3 * 3 <= x`, which simplifies to `9 <= x`.

Since `x` is derived from `arr[0]`, we know that `arr[0]` is at least 4, but the specific value of `x` is uncertain without knowing `k`. However, the condition requires `x` to be at least 9 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust our constraints on `x` to reflect that it must be greater than or equal to 9. 

Currently, we are not given an explicit constraint on `x`, so for the loop to execute again, we can specify that `x` must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `cnt` is {2: k}, where k is the number of times `arr[0]` is divisible by 2; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to 9**
