`cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The current value of `i` is 3, so we check `cnt[3]`. The previous value of `cnt[3]` is 2, which means `cnt.get(3, 0)` returns 2. Therefore, `cnt[3]` will be updated to 2 + 1, resulting in `cnt[3]` being 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `cnt` is {2: k, 3: 3}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is divided by 3.0.**
