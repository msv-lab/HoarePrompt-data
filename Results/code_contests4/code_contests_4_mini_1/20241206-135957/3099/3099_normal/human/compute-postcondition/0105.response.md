According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value of the loop index, and `n` is the upper limit for the loop to run. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.

Assuming `i` is the current index, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`answer` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for each key in `cnt`, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
