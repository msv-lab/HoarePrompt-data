According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys in the `cnt` dictionary. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to know the state of the `key` variable after the last iteration and the number of keys in the `cnt` dictionary. At the end of the last iteration, `answer[key]` was updated, but we need to know the next `key` that will be processed during the next iteration.

Since `key` is currently the last key processed in the loop, to execute one more time, we need to increment `key` to the next key in `cnt`. If there are more keys in `cnt`, the loop will execute again.

State: **`answer[key]` is updated to max(`answer.get(key, 0)`, `cnt[key]`), for the loop to execute one more time `cnt` must have at least one more key after the current key.**
