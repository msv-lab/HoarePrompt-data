The value of `i` is incremented by 1, where the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `x` is less than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt[1]` is the count of how many times 1 divides the original value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is less than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt[1]` is the count of how many times 1 divides the original value of `x`**
