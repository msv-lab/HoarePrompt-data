The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `cnt`, `arr`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `cnt` is {2: k}, where k is the number of times `arr[0]` is divisible by 2; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is the value of `arr[0]` divided by 2^k.
