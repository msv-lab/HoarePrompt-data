The value of `cnt[i]` is updated using the `get` method, which retrieves the current value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt`. If `i` does not exist in `cnt`, it returns `0` as the default value. Then, `1` is added to this retrieved value. The variable `i` is `1`, so the update affects `cnt[1]`. The state of `x` and the variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1`.

Output State: **`x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1**
