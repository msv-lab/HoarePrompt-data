According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop condition checks if \( i \times i \) is less than or equal to \( x \). At the end of the last iteration, \( x \) is less than 2, which means \( i \times i \) must be adjusted to ensure that it remains less than or equal to \( x \) for the loop to execute again. 

Since \( x \) is less than 2, the maximum value for \( i \) that keeps the condition true is \( i \) being 1 (since \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \) is less than 2). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, \( i \) must be adjusted to ensure that \( i \) is less than or equal to 1.

State: **`x` is less than 2, `cnt[i]` is updated to the count of how many times `i` divides `x`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to 1**
