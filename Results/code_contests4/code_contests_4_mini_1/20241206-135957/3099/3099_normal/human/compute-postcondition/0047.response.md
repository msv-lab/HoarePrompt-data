According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cnt` dictionary. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must contain at least one key. Given that `cnt` is created based on the prime factorization of `arr[0]`, which is at least 4, it is likely that `cnt` will have keys corresponding to the prime factors of `arr[0]`. 

However, it is essential to ensure that `cnt` is not empty for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute include that `cnt` must have at least one key.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[0]`, these states do not affect the execution of the for loop directly but are provided context.

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
1. `cnt` must have at least one key (indicating that there are prime factors in `arr[0]`).
2. `key` will be the first key in the `cnt` dictionary.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[0]`; `cnt` is a dictionary containing at least one key from the prime factorization of `arr[0]`; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `key` is the first key in `cnt`.**
