The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 3 to 4. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 4; `cnt` is {2: k, 3: m}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is the final value of `x` that is not divisible by 3.
