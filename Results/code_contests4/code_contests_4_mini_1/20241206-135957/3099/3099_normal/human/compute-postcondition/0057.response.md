The value of `i` is assigned the value `2`. However, this does not affect any other variables or states directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`, where `i` is adjusted to be greater than the square root of `arr[0] + 1`; `i` is 2. 

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`, where `i` is adjusted to be greater than the square root of `arr[0] + 1`; `i` is 2.**
