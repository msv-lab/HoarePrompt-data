According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `x`. The loop will continue executing as long as \(i \times i\) is less than or equal to \(x\). At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition \(i \times i\) should still be less than or equal to \(x\).

If `i` is increased by 1, the next condition becomes \((i + 1) \times (i + 1) \leq x\). 

To ensure the loop can execute again, \(x\) must be at least \((i + 1) \times (i + 1)\). 

Thus, we need to adjust the value of \(x\) to ensure that the condition is satisfied.

State: **variable `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again x must be greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1)**
