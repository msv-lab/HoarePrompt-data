Output State: **`lcm` is the least common multiple of the integers represented by the prime factors in `answer`; `answer` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for all integers in `arr`; `arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is the result of applying `func_1` to the results of `func_2(lcm, func_4(x))` for all elements `x` in `arr`; `ans` is now an integer.**
