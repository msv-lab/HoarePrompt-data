According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[0]`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[0]` and we need to prepare for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be one greater than its current value, and `n` must still be greater than this adjusted value.

State: **`answer` contains the maximum values of each key from the prime factorization of `arr[0]`, `cnt` is a dictionary that has at least one key, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is adjusted to be greater than the square root of `arr[0] + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i`**
