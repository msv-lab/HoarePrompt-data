The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and previously `i` was 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The values of `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than 2, `i` is 3, `cnt` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for the key 2.

Output State: **`x` is less than 2, `i` is 3, `cnt` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for the key 2.**
