`cnt[i]` is assigned the value `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The value of `cnt.get(i, 0)` retrieves the current count of `i` in the `cnt` dictionary, defaulting to 0 if `i` is not present. Since `i` is 2, `cnt[2]` will be updated. The previous value of `cnt[2]` is either an existing count or 0 if it doesn't exist, and this value is incremented by 1. The states of `x` and the loop condition are not affected directly by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `x / 2`, `i` is 2, and `cnt[2]` is updated to `cnt.get(2, 0) + 1`.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `x / 2`, `i` is 2, and `cnt[2]` is updated to `cnt.get(2, 0) + 1**
