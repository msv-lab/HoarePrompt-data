According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys in the `cnt` dictionary. At the end of the last iteration, `answer[key]` has been updated to the maximum of `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`. The next iteration will involve the next key in the `cnt` dictionary. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we must consider that the loop will continue as long as there are more keys in the `cnt` dictionary to iterate over. If `key` was the last key in the previous iteration, the next key would be the next available key in the dictionary.

State: **`answer[key]` is updated to the maximum of `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`, for the loop to execute one more time `key` must be the next key in `cnt`**
