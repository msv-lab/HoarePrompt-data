The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Since `i` is 1, the result of `x /= i` will be the same as the previous value of `x`. Thus, `x` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is less than 2; `i` is 1; `cnt[1]` is 1**
