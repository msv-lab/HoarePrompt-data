The variable `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The method `cnt.get(i, 0)` retrieves the current count of prime factors for the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt`, returning `0` if `i` is not present. This means that if `i` is already in `cnt`, its count is increased by 1; if not, it starts from 0 and becomes 1.

The values of the other variables `answer` and `x` remain unchanged, as this line directly affects only the `cnt` dictionary and specifically the entry for the key `i`.

Output State: **`answer` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for each key in `cnt`, `i` is 2, `cnt[i]` is updated to the current count plus 1.**
