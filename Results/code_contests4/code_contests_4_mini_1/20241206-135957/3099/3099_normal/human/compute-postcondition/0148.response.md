Postcondition: ***`x` is less than 2, `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `x`, and `cnt` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for all prime keys found during the factorization of the original value of `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, `cnt[x]` is updated to `cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`, incrementing the count of prime factors for `x` by 1.***
