The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 4, so after execution, `i` becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 5; `cnt` is {2: k, 3: m, 4: j}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is no longer divisible by 4 and is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 5; `cnt` is {2: k, 3: m, 4: j}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is no longer divisible by 4 and is greater than or equal to 1.**
