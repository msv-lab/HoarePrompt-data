Postcondition: ***`x` is the value of `arr[i]` divided by the product of `i` raised to the power of `cnt[i]` for all prime factors `i` greater than the square root of the original value of `arr[0] + 1`. If `x` is not equal to 1, then the count of prime factors for the value `x` is incremented by 1.***
