According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop condition is `x % i == 0`, which means that `x` must be divisible by `i` (1 in this case) for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is less than 2. Since `i` is 1, any integer value of `x` will satisfy the condition `x % 1 == 0` (as all integers are divisible by 1). Therefore, the loop can execute again regardless of the exact value of `x`, as long as it remains an integer.

No states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time since the condition is already satisfied with the current values.

State: **`x` is less than 2, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is updated to `cnt.get(1, 0) + 1**
