The variable `cnt[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `cnt.get(i, 0)`, which retrieves the value associated with `i` in the dictionary `cnt`, returning 0 if `i` is not present. Then, 1 is added to this value. Since the initial state only mentions that `cnt[i]` is updated based on the previous value or set to 1 if `i` was not present, we do not have the specific previous values for `cnt[i]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt[i]` is either incremented or set to 1 based on its previous value.

Output State: **`cnt[i]` is updated based on the previous value or set to 1 if `i` was not present.**
