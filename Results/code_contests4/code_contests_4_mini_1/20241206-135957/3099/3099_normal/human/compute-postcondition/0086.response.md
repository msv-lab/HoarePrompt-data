According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will execute again if `x` is divisible by `i`, which means `x % i` must equal 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is still divisible by `i`, meaning the condition `x % i == 0` holds true. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is divided by `i`, `cnt[i]` is updated based on the previous value or set to 1 if `i` was not present**
