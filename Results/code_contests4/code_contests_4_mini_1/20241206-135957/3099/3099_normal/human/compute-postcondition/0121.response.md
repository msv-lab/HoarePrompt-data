According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop continues as long as \( i \times i \) is less than or equal to \( x \). At the end of the last iteration, \( x \) is less than 2 and \( i \) is 3. 

Calculating \( i \times i \) gives us \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \). Since 9 is greater than any value that \( x \) can be (as \( x \) is less than 2), the current condition \( i \times i \leq x \) is not satisfied. 

To allow the loop to execute again, \( x \) would need to be at least 9 (since \( i \) is 3, \( i \times i \) must be less than or equal to \( x \)). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of \( x \).

State: **`x` is less than 2, for the loop to execute again `x` must be at least 9**
