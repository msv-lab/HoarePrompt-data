Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[0]`; `cnt` is a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `arr[0]`; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is not equal to 1; `cnt[x]` is updated to `cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`, meaning `cnt[x]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 if `x` is not already a key in `cnt`.**
