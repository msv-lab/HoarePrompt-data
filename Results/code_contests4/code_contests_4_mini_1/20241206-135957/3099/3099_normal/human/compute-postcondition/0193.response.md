The function `func_6` does not explicitly accept any parameters directly, but it is implied that it uses a positive integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` positive integers as inputs based on the context provided. The constraints specify that `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^4\), and each element \(A_i\) in the list `A` satisfies \(1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6\).

Since there is no specific output condition provided in the output section, we can only state the general expected behavior based on the provided constraints. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to operate on a positive integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` positive integers, adhering to the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 10^4) and a list A of N positive integers (1 <= A_i <= 10^6).**
