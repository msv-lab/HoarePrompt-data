To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as \( i \times i \) is less than or equal to \( x \).

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- \( x \) is equal to the value of \( arr[2] \) divided by \( 2 \) raised to the power of \( cnt.get(2, 0) \).
- \( i \) has been increased by 1.

Given that \( i \) has been increased, the new value of \( i \) is crucial. We need to ensure that \( i \times i \) is still less than or equal to \( x \) for the loop to execute again. 

Since \( i \) has been increased by 1, we can denote its previous value as \( i_{\text{prev}} \) (the value before it was increased). Thus:
- The new value of \( i \) is \( i_{\text{prev}} + 1 \).

For the loop to run one more time, we need:
\[
(i_{\text{prev}} + 1) \times (i_{\text{prev}} + 1) \leq x
\]

This inequality can be simplified to:
\[
i_{\text{prev}}^2 + 2 \cdot i_{\text{prev}} + 1 \leq x
\]

Since we know \( i_{\text{prev}} \times i_{\text{prev}} \leq x \) (the condition at the end of the previous iteration), we need to ensure that \( x \) is greater than or equal to \( i_{\text{prev}}^2 + 2 \cdot i_{\text{prev}} + 1 \).

Since we do not have the specific values for \( arr[2] \) or \( cnt \), we cannot determine if \( x \) satisfies this condition.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the relevant states need to be adjusted as follows: \( x \) must be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than or equal to \( (i_{\text{prev}} + 1) \times (i_{\text{prev}} + 1) \).

State: **`x` is equal to the value of `arr[2]` divided by `2` raised to the power of `cnt.get(2, 0)` and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1)**
