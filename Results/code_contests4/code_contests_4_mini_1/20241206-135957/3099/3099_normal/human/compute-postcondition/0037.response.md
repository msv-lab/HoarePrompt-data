`cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. Here, `i` is 4, so we check `cnt[4]`. The current value of `cnt[4]` is 1. The `get` method returns 1 (the current value), and we add 1 to it, resulting in `cnt[4]` being updated to 2. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 4; `cnt` is {2: k, 3: m, 4: 2}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is now `x / 4`.**
