`x` is updated to the value of `arr[0] / 2`, and since `arr[0]` is at least 4, `x` is at least 2. Now, `x` is divided by `i`, which is 2. Therefore, the new value of `x` becomes `arr[0] / 2 / 2`, which simplifies to `arr[0] / 4`. Since `arr[0]` is at least 4, `x` will be at least 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2; `cnt` is {2: 1}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is at least 1 (specifically `x` is `arr[0] / 4`).

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2; `cnt` is {2: 1}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is `arr[0] / 4`.**
