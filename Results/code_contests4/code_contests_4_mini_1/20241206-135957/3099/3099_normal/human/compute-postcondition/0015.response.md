`x` is assigned the value of `arr[0] / 4`, and since `arr[0]` is at least 8, `x` is at least 2. The value of `i` is 2, so when we execute `x /= i`, we divide `x` by `i`. Therefore, the new value of `x` will be at least 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2; `cnt` is {2: 2}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 8; `x` is at least 1.**
