The value of `cnt[i]` is assigned the result of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. Since `i` is 2, it checks if `cnt` has a value at key 2. If it does, it increments that value by 1; if it doesnâ€™t, it initializes it to 0 and then adds 1. The variable `cnt` is updated based on the previous state of `cnt[2]`.

The states of the other variables (`x`, `arr`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value of `arr[2] / 2`, `i` is 2, and `cnt[2]` is updated based on its previous value.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value of `arr[2] / 2`, `i` is 2, and `cnt[2]` is updated based on its previous value.**
