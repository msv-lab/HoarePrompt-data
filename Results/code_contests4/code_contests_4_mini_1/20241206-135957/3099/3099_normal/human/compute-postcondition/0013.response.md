The code updates the dictionary `cnt` by setting `cnt[i]` to the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. Here, `i` is 2, and `cnt` currently has the value `{2: 1}`. The method `get(i, 0)` will return the current value of `cnt[2]`, which is 1. Thus, `cnt[i]` will be updated to `1 + 1`, resulting in `cnt[2]` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2; `cnt` is {2: 2}; `arr` is defined such that `arr[0]` is at least 4; `x` is `arr[0] / 4**
