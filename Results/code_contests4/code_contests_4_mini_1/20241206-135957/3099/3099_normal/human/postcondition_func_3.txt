The function accepts a list `a` of N positive integers and returns the result of calling `func_3` with `a` and a modified value of `mod`, which is decremented by 2. It is important to note that the actual function `func_3` is not defined within the provided code, so the specifics of what the function returns depend on the behavior of `func_3`.
