The function accepts an integer `a` and a list `b` of positive integers. It returns `1` if `b` is equal to `0`. If the sum of elements in `b` is odd, it recursively calls itself with `b` decremented by one and applies `func_2` to the results. If the sum of elements in `b` is even, it calculates a temporary value by calling itself with `b` halved and then applies `func_2` with this temporary value as both arguments. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `b` may not be a valid list or where `a` is not a positive integer, which could lead to errors.
