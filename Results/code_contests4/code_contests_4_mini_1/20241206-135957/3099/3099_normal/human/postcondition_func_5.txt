The function accepts a positive integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` positive integers. It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `A` based on their prime factorization, and then it applies a series of operations involving other functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_4`) to produce a final result. Finally, it prints this result. The function assumes that the helper functions behave correctly and that the input adheres to the specified constraints.
