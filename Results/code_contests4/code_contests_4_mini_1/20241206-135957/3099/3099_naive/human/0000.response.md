To analyze the given program against the problem description, we need to ensure that it correctly calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N such that A_i B_i = A_j B_j for all valid pairs (i, j) while returning the result modulo (10^9 + 7).

### Steps of the Program:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads an integer N followed by N integers in a list `arr`.
2. **Prime Factorization**: For each number in `arr`, it performs prime factorization and counts the occurrences of each prime factor.
3. **Calculating LCM**: It determines the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers using the maximum exponent of each prime factor found in the previous step.
4. **Calculating the Sum**: Finally, it calculates the sum of LCM divided by each A_i, and this sum is computed modulo (10^9 + 7).

### Potential Issues:

1. **Division by Zero**: The function `my_inv` is used for modular inversion, which assumes that the input is never zero. If any value in `arr` is zero (which is theoretically against the problem's constraints since all values are strictly positive), this will lead to a division error.
2. **Floating Point Division**: The line `temp = func_3(a, b / 2)` uses floating point division for `b`. This will lead to incorrect results since `b` must be an integer.
3. **Incorrect Modulo Application**: The way the modulo is applied may lead to incorrect results if `lcm` is too large and the divisions are not handled properly.

### Testing Against Sample Cases:

Let's consider the case when `arr = [2, 3, 4]`:

- The prime factorization would yield:
  - 2: {2: 1}
  - 3: {3: 1}
  - 4: {2: 2}
- The LCM would be calculated as `2^2 * 3^1 = 12`.
- The result would then be computed as:
  - (12 / 2) + (12 / 3) + (12 / 4) = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13.
  
This matches the expected output (13).

Now letâ€™s consider an edge case like `arr = [1, 1, 1]`:

- The prime factorization for each would yield an empty dictionary since 1 has no prime factors.
- The LCM would default to 1, and the final sum would be calculated as:
  - (1 / 1) + (1 / 1) + (1 / 1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
  
This would be incorrect since the expected result should be `3` and not `3 % (10^9 + 7)` (which is still `3`).

### Conclusion:

Given the floating point division and the potential for division errors or incorrect modulo handling, the program may not handle all scenarios correctly, especially with the use of zero or non-integer values during calculations.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The implementation does not correctly handle all edge cases as outlined in the problem description, particularly with potential division issues and incorrect assumptions regarding inputs.
