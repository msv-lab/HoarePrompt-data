The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by three sequences of n integers each: a, b, and c, where each element in the sequences satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100 and a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.
