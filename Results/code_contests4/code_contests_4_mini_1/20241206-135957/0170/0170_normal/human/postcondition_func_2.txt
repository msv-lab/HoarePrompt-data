The function accepts no parameters and retrieves input from the user, parsing it into a list of integers. It returns a map object containing integers that represent a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. Each integer is expected to be in the range from 1 to 100. However, since the function does not handle any input validation, any input that does not conform to these specifications could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
