n is an integer representing the number of elements in the sequences (3 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), and num is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three lists of integers (a, b, c) of size n, with each integer in the range 1 to 100 and ensuring that a[i] ≠ b[i], a[i] ≠ c[i], b[i] ≠ c[i] for all i.
