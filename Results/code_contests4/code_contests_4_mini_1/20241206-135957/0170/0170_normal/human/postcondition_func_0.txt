The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user. However, it does not enforce any constraints on the input value, meaning the user can enter any integer, not just those within the specified range of 1 to 100. Therefore, the functionality is to read and return an integer input from the user without validating it against the given constraints.
