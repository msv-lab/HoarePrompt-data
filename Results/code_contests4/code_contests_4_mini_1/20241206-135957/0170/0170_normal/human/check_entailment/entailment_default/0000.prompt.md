You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three sequences: a_1, a_2, …, a_n; b_1, b_2, …, b_n; c_1, c_2, …, c_n.

For each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.

Find a sequence p_1, p_2, …, p_n, that satisfy the following conditions:

  * p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}
  * p_i ≠ p_{(i mod n) + 1}.



In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements i,i+1 adjacent for i<n and also elements 1 and n) will have equal value.

It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100): the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100): the number of elements in the given sequences.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains n integers c_1, c_2, …, c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.

Output

For each test case, print n integers: p_1, p_2, …, p_n (p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}, p_i ≠ p_{i mod n + 1}).

If there are several solutions, you can print any.

1 3 4 3 2 4 2
1 3 2
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2

Note

In the first test case p = [1, 2, 3].

It is a correct answer, because:

  * p_1 = 1 = a_1, p_2 = 2 = b_2, p_3 = 3 = c_3 
  * p_1 ≠ p_2 , p_2 ≠ p_3 , p_3 ≠ p_1 



All possible correct answers to this test case are: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].

In the second test case p = [1, 2, 1, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = a_3, p_4 = a_4. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.

In the third test case p = [1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = b_3, p_4 = b_4, p_5 = b_5, p_6 = c_6, p_7 = c_7. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user. However, it does not enforce any constraints on the input value, meaning the user can enter any integer, not just those within the specified range of 1 to 100. Therefore, the functionality is to read and return an integer input from the user without validating it against the given constraints.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the raw input provided by the user, which is expected to be a string representation of the values for t, n, and the lists a, b, c. However, it does not enforce or validate any constraints on these values, such as the expected ranges for t and n, or the uniqueness of elements within the lists. Therefore, it simply captures user input without any built-in checks for correctness or format.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and retrieves input from the user, parsing it into a list of integers. It returns a map object containing integers that represent a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. Each integer is expected to be in the range from 1 to 100. However, since the function does not handle any input validation, any input that does not conform to these specifications could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object that converts a sequence of space-separated integers read from input into strings. It does not handle any potential cases where the input could be malformed or not conforming to the expected format, such as non-integer values.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list containing the results of the function `func_3()` for multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three sequences of integers, with the constraints that for each index, the integers in the sequences are distinct and within the range of 1 to 100, and the total number of test cases can range from 1 to 100. Additionally, the function assumes that `func_3()` is defined elsewhere and is responsible for processing these test cases.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function initializes a new thread to execute the `main` function, which is expected to handle multiple test cases involving integer inputs and sequences, but does not itself process any inputs or produce any outputs directly. It simply sets up the environment for concurrency without returning any results or handling the input parameters.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a tuple `item` containing three sequences of integers and returns the second sequence of integers from the tuple. It assumes that the input tuple will always have three sequences, each with exactly `n` elements, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 100` and all elements are in the range [1, 100]. The function does not handle any validation or edge cases regarding the structure or content of the tuple beyond this assumption.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer followed by three lists of integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on the values returned by the function 'getKey' applied to each test case. The function does not handle cases where 'getKey' might raise an error, nor does it validate the input format or constraints beyond what is assumed in the annotations.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a list of tuples `num`. It returns a list containing `m` elements, where each element is a copy of the list `num`. Each element in `num` consists of three lists of integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) of size `n`. The function does not validate the contents of `num` or check for the uniqueness of elements across `a`, `b`, and `c`, as specified in the annotations.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three distinct integers. It returns `True` if `x` is not empty and contains only one unique tuple (the result of the bitwise expression `not x & (x - 1)` evaluates to `True`), otherwise it returns `False` if `x` is empty or contains multiple tuples. The overall result of the function is not directly related to the contents of the tuples themselves.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. It does not handle invalid values of `n` outside the specified range, but given the preconditions, it will always return a valid binary string for any integer `n` in the range of 3 to 100.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and returns a list of the individual digits of `n`. The input constraints ensure that `n` is always a valid integer within this range, and the function accurately converts `n` to a string, extracts each digit, and returns them as integers in a list format.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of tuples `r`, and it calculates the combination result using the factorial of `n` and the integer `r`. However, the implementation appears to incorrectly use `r` as an integer in the factorial calculation, while `r` should represent the number of selections being made (which is not directly provided from the tuples). The function does not handle potential edge cases related to the tuple contents or the implications of choosing values from `r`, resulting in an incorrect calculation if `r` is not a single integer or not properly defined in the context of combinations.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts a list of integers `x` and an integer `y`. It attempts to divide a single integer `x` by `y` and returns the result of this division, either as `x // y` or `x // y + 1` depending on whether `x` is divisible by `y`. However, the function does not process multiple test cases as suggested by the annotations, and it does not handle the sequence of integers in `x` correctly. Instead, it assumes `x` is a single integer, which is inconsistent with the expected input structure described in the annotations. Therefore, it lacks any functionality for handling the multiple test cases correctly.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts an integer `x` (number of test cases), an integer `y` (number of elements in the sequences), and a list `p` of tuples containing three lists of integers. The function computes and returns the result of exponentiation by squaring, specifically calculating \( x^y \mod p \). It does not directly utilize the contents of `p` in the computation, which may be misleading based on the annotations. Additionally, since `x` is modified to `x % p`, and `p` is expected to be an integer during this operation, it could raise an error if `p` is not an integer.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts a positive integer `x` and a list of tuples `y`. It performs a while loop that continues until `y` is empty, where it repeatedly updates `x` with the value of `y` and `y` with the result of `x % y`. Eventually, it returns the last non-empty value of `x`, which represents the result of the last computation before `y` became empty. However, the function does not utilize the contents of the tuples in `y` and does not return any meaningful results related to the test cases described in the input.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 3 to 100 and returns True if `n` is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. Additionally, it checks for divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `n`, returning False if any divisors are found. If `n` passes all these checks, it is confirmed to be prime, and the function returns True.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function does not accept any parameters and reads multiple test cases from an input file, processing three lists of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which follow specific constraints. However, the function does not return any values or perform any computations based on these lists, as it only sets up input and output redirection. Therefore, it lacks any evaluative or output functionality related to the test cases described.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        n = func_1()

        func_20(*ans)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function accepts no parameters and processes multiple test cases, each involving three lists `a`, `b`, and `c` of integers. It constructs a new list `ans` of the same length as the input lists, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in `ans` are equal. It initializes the first element of `ans` with the first element of `a`, then iteratively assigns values from `a`, `b`, or `c` to `ans` based on the condition that the chosen value must not be equal to the previous element in `ans`. After constructing `ans`, it calls `func_20` with `*ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value.

 Output decription for function20:  The function accepts a list of tuples `args`, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and three lists of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each containing `n` integers. It prints the string representation of each tuple in `args`, separated by a specified separator (default is a space) and followed by a specified end character (default is a newline). The function also allows for flushing the output stream if specified. However, the behavior of the function is not explicitly defined in terms of handling invalid input, such as the actual structure and content of the tuples, which may lead to unexpected results if the constraints are not adhered to.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
