The function accepts a positive integer `x` and a list of tuples `y`. It performs a while loop that continues until `y` is empty, where it repeatedly updates `x` with the value of `y` and `y` with the result of `x % y`. Eventually, it returns the last non-empty value of `x`, which represents the result of the last computation before `y` became empty. However, the function does not utilize the contents of the tuples in `y` and does not return any meaningful results related to the test cases described in the input.
