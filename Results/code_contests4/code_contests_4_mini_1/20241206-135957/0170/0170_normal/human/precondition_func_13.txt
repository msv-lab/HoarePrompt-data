x is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the sequences a_1, a_2, …, a_n, b_1, b_2, …, b_n, c_1, c_2, …, c_n for multiple test cases, and y is an integer representing the number of test cases such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 100 and for each test case, the number of elements n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) in the sequences is followed by three lists of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and satisfies a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.
