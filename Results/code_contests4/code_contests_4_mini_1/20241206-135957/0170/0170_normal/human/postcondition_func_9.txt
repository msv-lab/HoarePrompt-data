The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three distinct integers. It returns `True` if `x` is not empty and contains only one unique tuple (the result of the bitwise expression `not x & (x - 1)` evaluates to `True`), otherwise it returns `False` if `x` is empty or contains multiple tuples. The overall result of the function is not directly related to the contents of the tuples themselves.
