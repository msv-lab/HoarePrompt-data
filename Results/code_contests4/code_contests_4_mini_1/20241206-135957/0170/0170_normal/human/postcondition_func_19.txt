The function accepts a list of tuples `args`, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and three lists of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each containing `n` integers. It prints the string representation of each tuple in `args`, separated by a specified separator (default is a space) and followed by a specified end character (default is a newline). The function also allows for flushing the output stream if specified. However, the behavior of the function is not explicitly defined in terms of handling invalid input, such as the actual structure and content of the tuples, which may lead to unexpected results if the constraints are not adhered to.
