The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a list of tuples `num`. It returns a list containing `m` elements, where each element is a copy of the list `num`. Each element in `num` consists of three lists of integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) of size `n`. The function does not validate the contents of `num` or check for the uniqueness of elements across `a`, `b`, and `c`, as specified in the annotations.
