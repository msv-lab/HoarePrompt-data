The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by three sequences of n integers (a, b, c) such that for each index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), a[i] ≠ b[i], a[i] ≠ c[i], and b[i] ≠ c[i]. Each integer in the sequences is within the range 1 to 100. The total number of test cases t is between 1 and 100.
