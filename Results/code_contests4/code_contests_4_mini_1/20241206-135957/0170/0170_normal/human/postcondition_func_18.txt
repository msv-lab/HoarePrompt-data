The function accepts no parameters and processes multiple test cases, each involving three lists `a`, `b`, and `c` of integers. It constructs a new list `ans` of the same length as the input lists, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in `ans` are equal. It initializes the first element of `ans` with the first element of `a`, then iteratively assigns values from `a`, `b`, or `c` to `ans` based on the condition that the chosen value must not be equal to the previous element in `ans`. After constructing `ans`, it calls `func_20` with `*ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value.
