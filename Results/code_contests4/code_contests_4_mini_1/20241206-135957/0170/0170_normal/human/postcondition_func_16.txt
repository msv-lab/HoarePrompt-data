The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 3 to 100 and returns True if `n` is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. Additionally, it checks for divisibility by numbers of the form `6k Â± 1` up to the square root of `n`, returning False if any divisors are found. If `n` passes all these checks, it is confirmed to be prime, and the function returns True.
