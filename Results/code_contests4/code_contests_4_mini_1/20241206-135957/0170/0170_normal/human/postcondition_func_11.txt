The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and returns a list of the individual digits of `n`. The input constraints ensure that `n` is always a valid integer within this range, and the function accurately converts `n` to a string, extracts each digit, and returns them as integers in a list format.
