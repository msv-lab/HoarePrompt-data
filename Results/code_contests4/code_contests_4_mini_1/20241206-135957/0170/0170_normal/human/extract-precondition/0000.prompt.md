You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given three sequences: a_1, a_2, …, a_n; b_1, b_2, …, b_n; c_1, c_2, …, c_n.

For each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.

Find a sequence p_1, p_2, …, p_n, that satisfy the following conditions:

  * p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}
  * p_i ≠ p_{(i mod n) + 1}.



In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements i,i+1 adjacent for i<n and also elements 1 and n) will have equal value.

It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100): the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100): the number of elements in the given sequences.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains n integers c_1, c_2, …, c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.

Output

For each test case, print n integers: p_1, p_2, …, p_n (p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}, p_i ≠ p_{i mod n + 1}).

If there are several solutions, you can print any.

Note

In the first test case p = [1, 2, 3].

It is a correct answer, because:

  * p_1 = 1 = a_1, p_2 = 2 = b_2, p_3 = 3 = c_3 
  * p_1 ≠ p_2 , p_2 ≠ p_3 , p_3 ≠ p_1 



All possible correct answers to this test case are: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].

In the second test case p = [1, 2, 1, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = a_3, p_4 = a_4. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.

In the third test case p = [1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = b_3, p_4 = b_4, p_5 = b_5, p_6 = c_6, p_7 = c_7. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.
