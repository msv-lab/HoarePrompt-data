The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer followed by three lists of integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on the values returned by the function 'getKey' applied to each test case. The function does not handle cases where 'getKey' might raise an error, nor does it validate the input format or constraints beyond what is assumed in the annotations.
