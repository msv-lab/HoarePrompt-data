The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of tuples `r`, and it calculates the combination result using the factorial of `n` and the integer `r`. However, the implementation appears to incorrectly use `r` as an integer in the factorial calculation, while `r` should represent the number of selections being made (which is not directly provided from the tuples). The function does not handle potential edge cases related to the tuple contents or the implications of choosing values from `r`, resulting in an incorrect calculation if `r` is not a single integer or not properly defined in the context of combinations.
