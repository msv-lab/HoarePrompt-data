Postcondition: ***`args` is a list of tuples containing integers and lists; `x` is the last tuple in `args`; `file` now contains the string representation of all tuples in `args` separated by ' '; `at_start` is False; `file` is updated by writing `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`; `kwargs` contains the key 'flush' with a value of True or 'flush' key does not exist, otherwise returns '\n'***
