Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are lists of integers of length `n`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the loop does not execute a second time. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[n - 1]` is assigned the value of `c[n - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans[n - 1]` is assigned the value of `b[n - 1].`***
