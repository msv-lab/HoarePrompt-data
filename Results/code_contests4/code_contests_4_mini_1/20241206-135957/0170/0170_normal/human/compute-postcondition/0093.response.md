Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a`, `b`, and `c` are lists of integers of length `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` ensuring that consecutive values in `ans` are not equal; `func_20` is called with `*ans` for each test case.**
