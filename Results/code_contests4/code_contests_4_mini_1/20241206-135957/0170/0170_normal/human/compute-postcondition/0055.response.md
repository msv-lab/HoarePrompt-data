The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `ans[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans[3]` will be updated with the value from `a[3]`. Since `n` is greater than 3, `a` must contain at least 4 elements. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 3; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is updated to `a[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 3; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 3; `ans[3]` is updated to `a[3]**.
