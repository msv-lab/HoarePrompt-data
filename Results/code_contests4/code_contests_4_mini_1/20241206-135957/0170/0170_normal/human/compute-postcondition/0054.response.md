According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `n` is greater than 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 3.

For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 3, as `i` will be 3 after this iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 3; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 3.**
