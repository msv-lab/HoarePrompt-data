Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, and `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.***
