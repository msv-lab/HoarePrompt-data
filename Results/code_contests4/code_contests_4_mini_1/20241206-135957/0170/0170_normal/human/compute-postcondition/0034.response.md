The value of `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The variable `a` was previously assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, which means that `b` will have the same value as `a`. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and is now assigned a value greater than 1; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is also assigned the same value returned by `func_5()`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and is now assigned a value greater than 1; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is assigned the same value returned by `func_5()`.**
