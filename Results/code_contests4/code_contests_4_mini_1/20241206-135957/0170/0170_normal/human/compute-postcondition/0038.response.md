According to the code, the loop is defined to iterate `i` from 1 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1, which is already guaranteed by the given state. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be 1 as it initializes from the range starting point of 1. Since the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`, and given that `n` is at least 3 (which is also guaranteed), the loop will successfully execute multiple times.

The only relevant states to confirm for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be initialized to 1 (which it will be as per the loop definition).
- `n` must remain greater than 1 (which it is as stated).

Thus, the relevant states can be summarized as follows:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is the value returned by `func_5(); b` is the same value returned by `func_5(); c` is the value returned by `func_5(); `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `ans[0]` is assigned the value `a[0]; i is 1`**
