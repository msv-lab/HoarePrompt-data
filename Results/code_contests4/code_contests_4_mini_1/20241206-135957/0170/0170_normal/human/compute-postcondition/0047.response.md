Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();` and `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `ans[i - 1]` is equal to both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`; if `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`.***
