Output State: **`args` is a list of tuples containing integers and lists; `x` is the last tuple in `args`; `file` now contains the string representation of all tuples in `args` separated by ' '; `at_start` is False; `file` is updated by writing `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` which returns the value of `kwargs` with the key 'end' if it exists, otherwise returns '\n'.**
