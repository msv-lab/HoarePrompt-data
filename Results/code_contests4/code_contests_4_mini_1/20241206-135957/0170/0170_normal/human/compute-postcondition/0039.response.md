Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is the value returned by `func_5(); b` is the same value returned by `func_5(); c` is the value returned by `func_5(); `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `ans[0]` is assigned the value `a[0]; i is 1; the value of `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`***
