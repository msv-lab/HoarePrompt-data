Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1();`; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5();`; `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_5();`; `c` is now assigned the value returned by `func_5();`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing distinct values chosen from `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the conditions provided in the loop; `ans` is initialized as a list of zeros with length `n`; `ans[0]` is now assigned the value of `a[0]`.**
