Given the initial state, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` is 3, so `ans[3]` will be assigned `a[3]`. However, the values of `a` and `ans` are not provided and remain unspecified. The state of `t`, `n`, and `i` does not change.

Since we don't have specific values for `a[3]`, we cannot specify what `ans[3]` becomes, but we can note that the assignment takes place. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment operation without specific values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `a[3]`.**
