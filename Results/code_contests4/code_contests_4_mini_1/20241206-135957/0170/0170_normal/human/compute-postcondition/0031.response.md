According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the return value of `func_1()`. The function `func_1()` must return a positive integer for the loop to execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100, `n` is an integer within the range of 3 to 100, and the lists `a`, `b`, and `c` all have a length of `n`. 

Since the loop executes based on the return value of `func_1()`, we need to ensure that this value is greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred. If the loop executed once, the next state should reflect one additional iteration, meaning we should account for the possibility that `func_1()` could return at least 1.

Assuming the loop executed once, we can say that `func_1()` should return a value greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the next relevant state adjustments would be made in anticipation of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are lists of integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` ensuring that consecutive values in `ans` are not equal, for the loop to execute a second time func_1() must return greater than 1.**
