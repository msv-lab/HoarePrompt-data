Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 3; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 3. If `ans[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `b[3]`. Otherwise, `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `c[3]`.***
