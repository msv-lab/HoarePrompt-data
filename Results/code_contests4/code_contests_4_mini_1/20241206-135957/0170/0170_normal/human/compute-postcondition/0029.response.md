Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are lists of integers of length `n`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` containing values based on the conditions evaluated during the loop execution. Specifically, `ans[i]` contains values from `a`, `b`, or `c` ensuring that consecutive values in `ans` are not equal.**
