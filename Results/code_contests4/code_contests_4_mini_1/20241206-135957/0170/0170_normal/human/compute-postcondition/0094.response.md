The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined constraints where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function uses three lists, `a`, `b`, and `c`, each containing integers of length `n`, where each element in the lists is in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100, and it is guaranteed that for all indices `i`, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed, but based on the constraints provided, it is implied that the function performs some operations involving these parameters and might return results based on the comparisons or calculations involving the lists. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates on predefined lists and integers, returning results based on the constraints and relationships defined among them.**
