Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and is now assigned a value greater than 1; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is assigned the same value returned by `func_5()`; `c` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `ans[0]` is assigned the value `a[0]`.**
