According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
