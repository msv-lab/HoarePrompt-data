According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which is incremented in each iteration of the loop. The loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and iterates while `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently 1 (the starting point of the loop). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` will become 2. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2 since `i` will be 2 when the loop condition is checked for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 2; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();` and `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 2.**
