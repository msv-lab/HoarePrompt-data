According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. The loop will execute as long as the number of iterations returned by `func_1()` is greater than the current iteration count. At the end of the last iteration, the current state indicates that we have already executed `func_1()` once, and we need to determine what the return value of `func_1()` is for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `n` is greater than 1, we can assume that the return value of `func_1()` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Thus, if the loop has executed `k` times, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than `k`. 

If the loop has executed `k` times, then `k` can be at most `func_1() - 1`, meaning `func_1()` must be greater than `k` for an additional iteration. Therefore, if we are currently on the k-th iteration, we will need `func_1()` to return at least `k + 1` to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing distinct values chosen from `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the conditions provided in the loop; for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return at least `k + 1` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed.**
