The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The previous values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables as well as the new list `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and is now assigned a value greater than 1; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is assigned the same value returned by `func_5()`; `c` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0.**
