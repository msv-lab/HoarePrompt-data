Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing distinct values chosen from `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the conditions provided in the loop, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in `ans` are the same.**
