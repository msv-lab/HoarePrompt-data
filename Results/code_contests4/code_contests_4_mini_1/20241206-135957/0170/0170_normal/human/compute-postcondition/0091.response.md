The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, assigning values to `ans[i]` based on the previous value `ans[i - 1]` and the corresponding values from lists `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since `ans` is initialized with zeros and the first element is assigned the value of `a[0]`, the loop ensures that no two consecutive elements in `ans` are the same. As the loop iterates, it checks each value in `a`, `b`, and `c` for the current index `i` to assign a distinct value that is different from the previous element.

After all the iterations, `ans` will contain distinct values chosen from `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring that `ans[i]` is not equal to `ans[i - 1]`. The final state of `ans` will depend on the conditions during the loop but will always conform to the requirement of having distinct consecutive values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ans` is a list of length `n` containing distinct values from `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `ans[i]` is not equal to `ans[i - 1]` for all `1 ≤ i < n.**
