The function `func_20` accepts a parameter `args`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100), and three lists of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each containing `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a[i], b[i], c[i] ≤ 100). The function ensures that for all indices `i`, the elements in the lists satisfy the condition that a[i] ≠ b[i], a[i] ≠ c[i], and b[i] ≠ c[i]. 

The functionality of the function `func_20` is to accept a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer and three corresponding lists of unique integers, and to process this input according to its internal logic, which is not specified in the description. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `args`, which is a list of tuples containing an integer `n` and three lists of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`, with the specified constraints.**
