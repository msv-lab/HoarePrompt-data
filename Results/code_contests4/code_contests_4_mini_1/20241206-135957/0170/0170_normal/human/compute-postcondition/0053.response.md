Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 2; `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_5();`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 2. If `ans[1]` is not equal to `a[2]`, then `ans[2]` is assigned the value of `a[2]`. Otherwise, if `ans[1]` is not equal to `b[2]`, then `ans[2]` is assigned the value of `b[2]`. If both conditions are false, then `ans[2]` is assigned the value of `c[2]`.***
