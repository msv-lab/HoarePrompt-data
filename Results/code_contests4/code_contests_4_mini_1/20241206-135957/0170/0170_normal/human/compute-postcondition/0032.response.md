Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and considering that `func_1()` is a function that must return a value greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, we will analyze the code:

- The variable `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` must return greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, we can infer that the value of `n` after this line will also be greater than 1.
- The previous value of `n` is not specified, but it must be consistent with its constraints (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100).

Since we don't have the specific output of `func_1()`, we can state that `n` is now influenced by the return value of `func_1()`, which is still greater than 1 but also must comply with the initial constraint for `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and is now assigned the value returned by `func_1()` which is greater than 1.**
