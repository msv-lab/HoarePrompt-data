The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list containing the results of the function `func_3()` for multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three sequences of integers, with the constraints that for each index, the integers in the sequences are distinct and within the range of 1 to 100, and the total number of test cases can range from 1 to 100. Additionally, the function assumes that `func_3()` is defined elsewhere and is responsible for processing these test cases.
