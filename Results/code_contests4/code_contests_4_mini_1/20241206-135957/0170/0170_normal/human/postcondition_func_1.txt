The function accepts no parameters and returns the raw input provided by the user, which is expected to be a string representation of the values for t, n, and the lists a, b, c. However, it does not enforce or validate any constraints on these values, such as the expected ranges for t and n, or the uniqueness of elements within the lists. Therefore, it simply captures user input without any built-in checks for correctness or format.
