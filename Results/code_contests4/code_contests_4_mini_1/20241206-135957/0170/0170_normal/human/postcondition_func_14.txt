The function accepts an integer `x` (number of test cases), an integer `y` (number of elements in the sequences), and a list `p` of tuples containing three lists of integers. The function computes and returns the result of exponentiation by squaring, specifically calculating \( x^y \mod p \). It does not directly utilize the contents of `p` in the computation, which may be misleading based on the annotations. Additionally, since `x` is modified to `x % p`, and `p` is expected to be an integer during this operation, it could raise an error if `p` is not an integer.
