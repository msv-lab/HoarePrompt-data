The function accepts a tuple `item` containing three sequences of integers and returns the second sequence of integers from the tuple. It assumes that the input tuple will always have three sequences, each with exactly `n` elements, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 100` and all elements are in the range [1, 100]. The function does not handle any validation or edge cases regarding the structure or content of the tuple beyond this assumption.
