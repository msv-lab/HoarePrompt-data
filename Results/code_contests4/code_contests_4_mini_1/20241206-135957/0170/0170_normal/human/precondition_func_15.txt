x is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and y is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by three lists of integers a, b, and c, where each list contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) such that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, and b_i ≠ c_i for all i.
