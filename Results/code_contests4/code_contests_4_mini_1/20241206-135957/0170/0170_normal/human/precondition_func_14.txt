x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), y is an integer representing the number of elements in the given sequences (3 ≤ y ≤ 100), and p is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three lists of integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) such that for each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, and b_i ≠ c_i.
