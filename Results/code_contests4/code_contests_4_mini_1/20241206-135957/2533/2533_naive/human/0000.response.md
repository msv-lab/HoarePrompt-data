To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and potential edge cases of the code.

### Problem Analysis:
The program aims to find the earliest time \( t \) such that all mice are strictly within the defined rectangle (mousetrap) when Igor decides to close it. 

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Mouse Movement**: Each mouse moves linearly based on its speed. The position of a mouse at time \( t \) can be calculated as:
   - \( x(t) = rix + vix \cdot t \)
   - \( y(t) = riy + viy \cdot t \)

2. **Conditions for Being Inside the Rectangle**: For a mouse to be strictly inside the rectangle defined by corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the following conditions must hold:
   - \( x1 < x(t) < x2 \)
   - \( y1 < y(t) < y2 \)

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the time intervals during which a mouse can enter and exit the rectangle based on its speed and position. 
   - If the mouse is moving towards the rectangle, the program calculates the time it will take to potentially be inside the rectangle.

### Code Walkthrough:
- The code reads inputs and initializes the time variables `t1` (earliest time) and `t2` (latest time).
- For each mouse, the program calculates when it can enter and exit the rectangle.
- If a mouse cannot ever enter the rectangle (based on its initial position and speed), the program outputs -1.
- Finally, it checks if the calculated times satisfy the condition that all mice can be inside the rectangle at the same time.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program should ensure that when a mouse starts outside the rectangle and moves away from it, it correctly identifies that it will never be able to enter the rectangle.
2. **Calculation of Times**: The use of `Fraction` for time calculations is a good choice for precision, but we need to ensure that the logic correctly captures when a mouse can be inside the rectangle.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- Consider a case where a mouse starts at a position that is already outside the rectangle and moving directly away from it. The program should correctly output -1 in such scenarios. 

### Example Case:
- Input:
```
1
1 1 3 3
4 4 1 1
```
- Expected Output: `-1` (mouse is moving away from the rectangle).
- The program should handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases, I found that the logic for handling mouse positions and determining the time intervals appears to be sound. There doesn't seem to be an evident case where the program would fail based on the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**.
