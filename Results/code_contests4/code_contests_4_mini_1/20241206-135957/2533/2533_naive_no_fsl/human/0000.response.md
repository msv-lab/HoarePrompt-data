To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code carefully.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to determine the earliest time `t` at which all mice are strictly inside a given rectangular mousetrap defined by two opposite corners `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. Each mouse starts at a position `(rix, riy)` and moves with a velocity `(vix, viy)`.

### Key Points from the Code
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of mice and the coordinates of the mousetrap.
   - It processes each mouse's initial position and velocity.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - For each mouse, based on its velocity, the program computes the earliest and latest times at which the mouse can enter or exit the mousetrap in both x and y dimensions.
   - It uses `Fraction` to ensure precision in time calculations.

3. **Conditions for Mice Movement**:
   - If a mouse does not move in a specific direction (i.e., `vx` or `vy` is zero) and its initial position is outside the bounds of the mousetrap, the program immediately returns `-1`.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - The program checks if the latest entry time and the earliest exit time allow for a valid interval where all mice can be caught.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Mice with Zero Velocity**:
   - If a mouse starts outside the mousetrap and does not move (`vix = 0` and `viy = 0`), it should return `-1`, which the code handles correctly.
   
2. **Mice Moving Away from the Mousetrap**:
   - For a mouse moving away from the mousetrap (e.g., starting inside but with a negative velocity), the program should correctly compute times and potentially return `-1`. The logic seems to handle this case as well.

3. **Multiple Mice**:
   - The program iteratively calculates the time bounds for each mouse. If any mouse cannot be caught (i.e., time bounds do not overlap), it will return `-1`.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the logic and edge cases, the program appears to correctly handle the requirements of the problem and covers the necessary scenarios stipulated in the problem description.

### Correctness Evaluation
Since I cannot find a single case where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements or logic, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
