According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. If there is another line of input available, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `value` is the last element yielded from `line.split()` if `line.split()` has elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to assume that there is another line available to read from `sys.stdin`, and `line.split()` should yield elements from that line.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; for the loop to execute one more time, `line` must be a non-empty string such that `line.split()` has elements, and `value` is the last element yielded from that new `line.split()`**
