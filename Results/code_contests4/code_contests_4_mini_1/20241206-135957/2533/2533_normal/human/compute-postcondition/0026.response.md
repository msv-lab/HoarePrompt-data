Functionality: ** The function reads lines of input from the standard input, splits each line into values, and yields each value one by one. It does not accept any parameters and does not return a final result; instead, it provides a generator that can be used to iterate through the yielded values. If no lines are processed, the last yielded value would be undefined. **
