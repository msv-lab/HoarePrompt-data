According to the code, the loop iterates over the input lines from `sys.stdin`. For the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one line of input available in `sys.stdin`. The variables `n`, `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and the mouse's initial position and speed are not directly relevant to whether the loop executes, as they do not influence the input stream.

Thus, for the loop to be executed at least once, it is necessary that there is at least one line of input present in `sys.stdin`. Since the state does not provide information on the content of `sys.stdin`, we assume it is prepared for input.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers such that 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100000; for the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one line of input available in sys.stdin.**
