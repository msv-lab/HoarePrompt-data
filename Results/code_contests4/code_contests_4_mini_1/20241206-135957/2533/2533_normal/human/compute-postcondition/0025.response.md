The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it processes inputs based on the given constraints which relate to a positive integer `n`, mouse positions `(rix, riy)` and `(x1, y1)`, and their speeds `(vix, viy)`. The function will produce an output based on the logic applied to these inputs, but the specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to operate on predefined constraints and return a result based on those inputs without accepting any parameters directly.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on predefined constraints, returning a result based on the internal logic applied to those constraints.**
