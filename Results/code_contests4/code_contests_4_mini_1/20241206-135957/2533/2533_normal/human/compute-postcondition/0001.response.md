According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the contents of the variable `line`. The loop will execute at least once if there is at least one item in `line.split()`. Given that `line` should contain at least one space-separated value from standard input, we can assume that the necessary state for the loop to execute includes the content of `line`. 

If `line` is not empty, `line.split()` will produce a list with at least one element, allowing the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure `line` contains at least one space-separated value. The other states, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, do not directly affect the loop execution but they remain as they are.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers such that 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100000; for the loop to execute at least once, line must contain at least one space-separated value, value is the first element from line.split()**
