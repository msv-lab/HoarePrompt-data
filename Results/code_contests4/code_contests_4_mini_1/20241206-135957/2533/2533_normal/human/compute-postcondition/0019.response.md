According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `line` and its split elements. If `line.split()` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `value` is the last element yielded from `line.split()`, indicating that there are no more elements left to yield from the current state of `line.split()`. 

Since `line.split()` is non-empty and contains elements, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, `line` must have at least one more element after the current `value`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the next `value` is the next element from the list generated by `line.split()`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `line` is a non-empty string with at least one more element, `value` is the next element in the list from `line.split()`**
