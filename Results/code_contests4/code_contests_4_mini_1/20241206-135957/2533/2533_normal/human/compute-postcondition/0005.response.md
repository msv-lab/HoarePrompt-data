According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements produced by `line.split()`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element available in the split result of the `line`. At the end of the last iteration, `value` is the second element yielded from `line.split()`. This means that `line.split()` has at least 2 elements. 

To execute the loop one more time, `line` must contain at least 3 elements when split. Therefore, `value` should be updated to represent the third element in the split result, and the iteration index should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers such that 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100000; value is yielded from the third element of line.split()**
