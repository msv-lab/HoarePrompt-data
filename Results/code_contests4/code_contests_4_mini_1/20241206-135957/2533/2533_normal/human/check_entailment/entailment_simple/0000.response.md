Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The program only contains a generator function `func_1()` that yields values from the input, but it does not implement any logic to determine the earliest time `t` at which all mice can be caught inside the mousetrap. 

Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Lack of Logic for Time Calculation**: The problem description requires determining the minimum non-negative time `t` such that all mice are strictly inside the defined rectangle (mousetrap) at that time. The program does not contain any calculations or algorithms to achieve this. It simply reads input values and yields them.

2. **No Handling of Mouse Movement**: The program does not account for the movement of the mice based on their initial positions and speeds. To solve the problem, one would need to compute the positions of the mice over time and determine when they enter the rectangle defined by `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

3. **No Output Generation**: The problem requires a specific output (the calculated time `t` or `-1`), but the program does not produce any output related to the calculations needed for the problem.

4. **Input Structure**: While the program correctly identifies the input structure (the number of mice and their positions/speeds), it does not utilize this information for any further processing.

Overall, the annotated program completely misses the implementation details required to solve the problem as described, thereby making it incorrect.
