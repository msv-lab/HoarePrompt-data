Correctness: **False**

The given annotated program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem requires a function that determines the earliest time at which all mice can be caught inside the mousetrap based on their initial positions and velocities. However, the provided code only reads input values and yields them one by one without performing any calculations or logic related to the positions and movements of the mice in relation to the mousetrap.

Key points of failure:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` does not implement the logic necessary to compute the minimum time \( t \) when all mice are strictly inside the mousetrap. It simply reads input and yields values, which is unrelated to the core problem.

2. **Output**: The problem requires a specific output (a non-negative number \( t \) or -1), but the current implementation does not produce any output related to this requirement.

3. **No Calculations**: There are no calculations or checks to determine if and when the mice will be inside the mousetrap based on their velocities and initial positions, which is the crux of the problem.

For these reasons, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements.
