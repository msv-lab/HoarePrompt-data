According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `node[2]`. If `node[2]` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second child. At the end of the last iteration, `child` is the first element in `node[2]`. To execute the loop one more time, `child` must be the second element in `node[2]`. Therefore, `max` remains unchanged at -1, and `lcm` remains updated from the previous iteration. 

State: **`lcm` is the result of `func_7(1, child[0])`, `max` is -1, for the loop to execute a second time `node[2]` must have at least 2 elements, `child` is the second child in `node[2]`.**
