Output State: **`lcm` is the least common multiple of `child[0]` values from all `k` children; `max` is updated to `t` if `max` is less than 0 or greater than `t`; `node[2]` must contain at least 3 children for the loop to execute a second time; `child` is the third child in `node[2]`; `k` is decremented to remain greater than 0; `t` is assigned the value of `child[1] / lcm * lcm`.**
