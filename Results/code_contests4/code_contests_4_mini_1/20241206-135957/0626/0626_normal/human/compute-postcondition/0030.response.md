The value of `node[1]` is assigned the value of `max * len(node[2])`. The values of `lcm` and `max` remain unchanged, and since we do not have specific values for `max` or `len(node[2])`, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `node[0]` is assigned the value of `lcm`; `node[1]` is assigned the value of `max * len(node[2])`, and the values of `lcm` and `max` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node[0]` is assigned the value of `lcm`; `node[1]` is assigned the value of `max * len(node[2])`; values of `lcm` and `max` remain unchanged.**
