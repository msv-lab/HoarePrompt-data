Postcondition: ***`lcm` is the least common multiple of `child[0]` values from all `k` children; `max` is -1 initially and is updated to `t` if `max` is less than 0 or greater than `t`. The value of `t` is calculated as `child[1] / lcm * lcm`, and `k` remains greater than 0, with `child` being the first child in `node[2]`.***
