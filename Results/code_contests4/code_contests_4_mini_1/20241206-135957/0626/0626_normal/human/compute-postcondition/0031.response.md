The function `func_9` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` is a tree represented as a rooted structure with `n` vertices, where `n` is an integer and satisfies the constraint (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Each leaf vertex in the tree contains a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) representing the number of apples, while non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. The vertex at index 1 has a value greater than or equal to 0. The function returns the tree structure represented by `node` with the aforementioned properties.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node, which is a tree structure with n vertices, returning the tree where each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer representing apples, and non-leaf vertices have a value of zero.**
