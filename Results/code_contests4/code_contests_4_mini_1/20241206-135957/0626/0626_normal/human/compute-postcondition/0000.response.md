Postcondition: ***`node` is a tree represented as a rooted structure with `n` vertices, where `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) representing the number of apples, and non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. The value of the vertex at index 1 in `node` is greater than or equal to 0. The tree is defined by n-1 edges connecting pairs of distinct vertices.***
