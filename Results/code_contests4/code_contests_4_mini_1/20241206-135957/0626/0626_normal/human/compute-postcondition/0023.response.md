Postcondition: ***`lcm` is the least common multiple of `child[0]` values from all `k` children; `max` is updated to `t` if `max` is less than 0 or greater than `t`. In this case, `t` is calculated as `child[1] / lcm * lcm`, and `k` is decremented to remain greater than 0, with `child` being the second child in `node[2]`. If the condition is not met, `max` remains unchanged.***
