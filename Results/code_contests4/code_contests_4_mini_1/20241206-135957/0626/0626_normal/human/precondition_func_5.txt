a is a list of integers representing the number of apples in each vertex of a rooted tree, with the first element corresponding to the root and subsequent elements corresponding to leaf vertices, where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8; b is a list of tuples representing edges between vertices, with each tuple containing two integers (xi, yi) indicating a connection between vertex xi and vertex yi, where 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n and xi ≠ yi. n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
