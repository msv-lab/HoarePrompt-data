n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each element a[i] (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^8) represents the number of apples in leaf vertex i; the tree edges are defined by n-1 pairs of integers (xi, yi) such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n and xi ≠ yi. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree.
