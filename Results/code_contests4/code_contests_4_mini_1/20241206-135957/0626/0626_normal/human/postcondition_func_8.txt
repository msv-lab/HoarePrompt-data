The function accepts a tree structure represented by the `node`, where `node` has `n` vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer representing apples, while non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. The function checks if the value of the root vertex (node[1]) is non-negative; if it is, the function returns early without modifying the tree. If the root vertex is negative, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the values of the children nodes and assigns this value to node[0]. It also calculates a maximum value derived from the child nodes' values and multiplies it by the number of children, assigning this to node[1]. The function does not handle cases where the tree structure is malformed or does not adhere to the assumptions about its structure.
