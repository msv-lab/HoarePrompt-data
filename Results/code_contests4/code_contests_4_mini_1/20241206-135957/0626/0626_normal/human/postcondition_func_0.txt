The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and returns a list of `n` strings, each representing the input values for the number of apples at the vertices, taken from user input. The function does not enforce any constraints on the values inputted, meaning users can enter any string, and there is no validation to ensure these inputs are integers or within the specified range for apples (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8).
