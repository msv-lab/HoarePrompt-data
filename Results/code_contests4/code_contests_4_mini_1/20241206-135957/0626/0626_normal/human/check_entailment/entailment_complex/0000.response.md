Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly address the problem description regarding counting the minimum number of apples needed to remove from the tree in order to make it balanced. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions for input do not validate that the inputs are integers or within the specified range. For example, the function `func_1` allows for arbitrary string input, which could lead to runtime errors later in the program when trying to process these values. This is a significant flaw since the problem description requires specific input formats.

2. **Tree Structure and Traversal**: The program does not provide a function that effectively calculates the weight of subtrees or checks for balance conditions. The description specifies that a tree is balanced if all child subtrees of a vertex have equal weight. The functions provided do not implement this logic.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Removals**: The functions do not compute the minimum number of apples to be removed to achieve balance in the tree. The annotations suggest that the program is attempting to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of weights, but the logic is flawed and does not align with the requirement of balancing the tree by removing apples from leaf nodes.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle various edge cases such as a tree where all leaf nodes are already balanced or where some leaf nodes contain zero apples. This could lead to incorrect results.

Overall, the lack of appropriate logic to compute the balance of the tree and the incorrect handling of input and edge cases lead to the conclusion that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
