Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Understanding of Tree Structure**: The program does not properly manage the tree structure as required. The program's functions appear to be more focused on manipulating lists and performing operations like Least Common Multiple (LCM) computations rather than understanding and calculating the weights of subtrees as described in the problem.

2. **Weight Calculation**: The problem requires calculating the weight of subtrees and ensuring that all children of any given node have equal weights for the tree to be balanced. The implementation in `func_9` seems to attempt to compute an LCM of some values but does not provide an accurate mechanism to calculate and compare the weights of the child nodes as required.

3. **Apples Removal Logic**: The program does not contain any logic for counting the minimum number of apples to remove to balance the tree. The expected output is a single integer representing the total number of apples that need to be removed to achieve balance, which is not present in the program.

4. **Functionality of the Functions**: Many of the functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) seem to be focused on input handling rather than solving the problem. The main logic for balancing the tree and calculating removals from leaves is not addressed in any of the functions clearly.

5. **Implementation Errors**: The use of `raw_input()` and other constructs does not align with the need for reading and processing tree data and calculations based on that structure.

In summary, the program lacks the necessary logic to compute subtree weights and to determine the minimum apples to remove for balancing the tree, which are critical requirements in the problem description. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements and is deemed incorrect.
