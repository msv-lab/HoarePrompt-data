You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. In each leaf vertex there's a single integer — the number of apples in this vertex. 

The weight of a subtree is the sum of all numbers in this subtree leaves. For instance, the weight of a subtree that corresponds to some leaf is the number written in the leaf.

A tree is balanced if for every vertex v of the tree all its subtrees, corresponding to the children of vertex v, are of equal weight. 

Count the minimum number of apples that you need to remove from the tree (specifically, from some of its leaves) in order to make the tree balanced. Notice that you can always achieve the goal by just removing all apples.

Input

The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105), showing the number of vertices in the tree. The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 108), ai is the number of apples in the vertex number i. The number of apples in non-leaf vertices is guaranteed to be zero. 

Then follow n - 1 lines, describing the tree edges. Each line contains a pair of integers xi, yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi) — the vertices connected by an edge. 

The vertices are indexed from 1 to n. Vertex 1 is the root.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the sin, cout streams cin, cout or the %I64d specifier.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), and there is a list of n integers where each integer represents the number of apples in the vertices (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) with non-leaf vertices guaranteed to have a value of zero. The tree structure is defined by n - 1 edges connecting pairs of vertices.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the number of vertices in the tree; a is a list of integers of length n (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8), where ai is the number of apples in the leaf vertices; and the tree is represented by n - 1 edges, each edge connecting two distinct vertices indexed from 1 to n.

The tree is defined with n - 1 edges connecting pairs of vertices, and the vertices are indexed from 1 to n with vertex 1 as the root.

    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the output of `func_2()` after converting each element to an integer

#Function 4:

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
