You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. In each leaf vertex there's a single integer — the number of apples in this vertex. 

The weight of a subtree is the sum of all numbers in this subtree leaves. For instance, the weight of a subtree that corresponds to some leaf is the number written in the leaf.

A tree is balanced if for every vertex v of the tree all its subtrees, corresponding to the children of vertex v, are of equal weight. 

Count the minimum number of apples that you need to remove from the tree (specifically, from some of its leaves) in order to make the tree balanced. Notice that you can always achieve the goal by just removing all apples.

Input

The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105), showing the number of vertices in the tree. The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 108), ai is the number of apples in the vertex number i. The number of apples in non-leaf vertices is guaranteed to be zero. 

Then follow n - 1 lines, describing the tree edges. Each line contains a pair of integers xi, yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi) — the vertices connected by an edge. 

The vertices are indexed from 1 to n. Vertex 1 is the root.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the sin, cout streams cin, cout or the %I64d specifier.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    return [raw_input().strip() for i in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and returns a list of `n` strings, each representing the input values for the number of apples at the vertices, taken from user input. The function does not enforce any constraints on the values inputted, meaning users can enter any string, and there is no validation to ensure these inputs are integers or within the specified range for apples (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8).
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return raw_input().strip()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a string input from the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. It does not handle any potential exceptions that may arise from invalid input types or other input-related issues, as it relies on the raw_input function to gather input directly from the user.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, func_2().split())
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers obtained from the output of `func_2()`, where each element is converted to an integer. Note that the output is not a list but a map object, which is an iterator in Python. This means that if the output is intended to be a list, it should be explicitly cast to a list using `list(map(...))` for proper usage.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return func_3()[0]
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the first element of the output from func_3. The output from func_3 is expected to contain information related to the number of apples in the leaf vertices of a tree structure, which is defined by a given integer n and a list a. However, without knowing the exact implementation of func_3, it is unclear what this first element represents or if it handles all edge cases related to the tree structure and the number of apples properly.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(o):
    print(o)
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts a tuple `o` that contains an integer `n` (representing the number of vertices in a tree), a list of `n` integers (each representing the number of apples in the leaf vertices), and a list of `n-1` pairs of integers (representing the edges of the tree). Currently, the function only prints the input tuple and does not perform any processing or produce any result based on the tree structure or the apples.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a %= b
        (a, b) = (b, a)
    return a
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a list of tuples `b`. It appears to implement an iterative algorithm that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values represented in `a` and `b`. However, the code does not utilize the elements of the list `a`, which means it only processes the list `b`. As written, the function will return the last non-zero value of `b` after performing the modulus operation, but it lacks proper handling for edge cases such as an empty list `b` or cases where all elements in `b` are zero. If `b` does not contain any non-zero values, the function may lead to unexpected results.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(a, b):
    return a / func_6(a, b) * b
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a list of integers `a` representing the number of apples at each leaf vertex and an integer `b` representing the number of edges in the tree. It returns the result of dividing each element in `a` by the output of `func_6(a, b)` (which may be a number or could potentially lead to a division by zero error if `func_6(a, b)` returns zero) and then multiplying by `b`. If `func_6(a, b)` returns zero, this will cause a division error, which is not handled in the code.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(node, parent):
    ii = -1
    for i in range(len(node[2])):
        if node[2][i] != parent:
            func_8(node[2][i], node)
        else:
            ii = i
    if ii >= 0:
        node[2].pop(ii)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a `node`, which is a list representing a vertex in a tree, and `parent`, which is the parent vertex of the current node. It recursively traverses the tree, removing the parent from the list of children in `node[2]` if it exists. The function does not return the number of apples associated with the specified node, as stated in the annotations, but instead modifies the input `node` in place by removing the specified parent from its children. There is no handling of the number of apples or any related computation.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(node):
    if node[1] >= 0:
        return
    lcm = 1
    max = -1
    for child in node[2]:
        func_9(child)
        lcm = func_7(lcm, child[0])
    for child in node[2]:
        t = child[1] / lcm * lcm
        if max < 0 or max > t:
            max = t
    node[0] = lcm
    node[1] = max * len(node[2])
sys.setrecursionlimit(20000)
startTime = datetime.now()
n = func_4()
sum = 0
ar = [0] * n
xx = func_3()
for i in range(len(xx)):
    x = xx[i]
    if x == 0:
        ar[i] = [1, -1, []]
    else:
        ar[i] = [1, x, []]
    sum += x
for i in range(n - 1):
    (x, y) = func_3()
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    ar[x][2].append(ar[y])
    ar[y][2].append(ar[x])
func_8(ar[0], [])
func_9(ar[0])
func_5(sum - ar[0][1])
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts a tree structure represented by the `node`, where `node` has `n` vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer representing apples, while non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. The function checks if the value of the root vertex (node[1]) is non-negative; if it is, the function returns early without modifying the tree. If the root vertex is negative, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the values of the children nodes and assigns this value to node[0]. It also calculates a maximum value derived from the child nodes' values and multiplies it by the number of children, assigning this to node[1]. The function does not handle cases where the tree structure is malformed or does not adhere to the assumptions about its structure.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
