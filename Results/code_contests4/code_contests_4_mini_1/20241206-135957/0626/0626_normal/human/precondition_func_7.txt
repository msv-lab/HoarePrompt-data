node is an integer representing a vertex in a tree with n vertices, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; parent is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current node, with the constraint that 1 ≤ parent ≤ n. The tree is defined such that all non-leaf vertices have a value of zero apples, while leaf vertices contain an integer number of apples (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8).
