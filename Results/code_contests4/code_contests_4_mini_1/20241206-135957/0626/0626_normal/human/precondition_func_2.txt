n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) represents the number of apples in the corresponding vertex, with non-leaf vertices having a value of zero. The tree is defined with n - 1 edges connecting pairs of vertices, and the vertices are indexed from 1 to n with vertex 1 as the root.
