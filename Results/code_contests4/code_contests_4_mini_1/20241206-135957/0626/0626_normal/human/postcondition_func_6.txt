The function accepts a list of integers `a` representing the number of apples at each leaf vertex and an integer `b` representing the number of edges in the tree. It returns the result of dividing each element in `a` by the output of `func_6(a, b)` (which may be a number or could potentially lead to a division by zero error if `func_6(a, b)` returns zero) and then multiplying by `b`. If `func_6(a, b)` returns zero, this will cause a division error, which is not handled in the code.
