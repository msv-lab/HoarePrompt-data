The function accepts no parameters and returns the first element of the output from func_3. The output from func_3 is expected to contain information related to the number of apples in the leaf vertices of a tree structure, which is defined by a given integer n and a list a. However, without knowing the exact implementation of func_3, it is unclear what this first element represents or if it handles all edge cases related to the tree structure and the number of apples properly.
