Precondition: **node is a tree represented as a rooted structure with n vertices, where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) representing the number of apples. Non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. The tree is defined by n-1 edges connecting pairs of distinct vertices.**
