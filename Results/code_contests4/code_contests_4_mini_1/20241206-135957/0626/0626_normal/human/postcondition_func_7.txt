The function accepts a `node`, which is a list representing a vertex in a tree, and `parent`, which is the parent vertex of the current node. It recursively traverses the tree, removing the parent from the list of children in `node[2]` if it exists. The function does not return the number of apples associated with the specified node, as stated in the annotations, but instead modifies the input `node` in place by removing the specified parent from its children. There is no handling of the number of apples or any related computation.
