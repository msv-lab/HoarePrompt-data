The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers obtained from the output of `func_2()`, where each element is converted to an integer. Note that the output is not a list but a map object, which is an iterator in Python. This means that if the output is intended to be a list, it should be explicitly cast to a list using `list(map(...))` for proper usage.
