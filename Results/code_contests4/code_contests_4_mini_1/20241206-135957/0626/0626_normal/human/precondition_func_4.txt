o is a tuple consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the tree, a list of n integers where each integer ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) represents the number of apples in the leaf vertices, and a list of n-1 pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree where each pair (xi, yi) (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi) connects two vertices.
