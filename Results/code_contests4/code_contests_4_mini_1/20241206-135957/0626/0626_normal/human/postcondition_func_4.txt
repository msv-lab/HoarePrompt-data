The function accepts a tuple `o` that contains an integer `n` (representing the number of vertices in a tree), a list of `n` integers (each representing the number of apples in the leaf vertices), and a list of `n-1` pairs of integers (representing the edges of the tree). Currently, the function only prints the input tuple and does not perform any processing or produce any result based on the tree structure or the apples.
