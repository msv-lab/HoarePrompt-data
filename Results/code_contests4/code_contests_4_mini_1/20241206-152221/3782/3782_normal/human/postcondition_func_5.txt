The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, along with a list of integers `fac` representing factorial values. It returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`, indicating that no valid combinations can be formed. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the number of combinations of `n` elements taken `k` at a time using the factorial values from the `fac` list. The function assumes that the list `fac` contains valid factorial values for all integers up to `n`.
