The function reads two integers, N and K, and a list of N integers from input. It computes a value `ans` based on the differences between consecutive sorted elements of the list and some combinatorial calculations involving the integers N and K using helper functions (func_1, func_2, func_3, func_6). The function then prints the final computed value `ans`. However, it does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when N is 1, which would lead to an incomplete calculation since `diff` is not computed. It also does not return any values; it only prints the result.
