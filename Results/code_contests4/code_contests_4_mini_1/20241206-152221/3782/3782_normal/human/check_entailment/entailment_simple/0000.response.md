Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, and `func_6`:** 
   - The functions seem to be performing basic arithmetic operations rather than the specific computations required by the problem description.
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are not handling the selection of K elements from the list A nor calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values of these selected elements.
   - `func_4` and `func_5` are not relevant to the task of computing combinations or their factorials in the context of the problem description.
   - `func_6` does not directly compute the necessary combinations in the context of how `f(S)` is defined, as it only returns a combination result without incorporating the logic to compute the sum of `f(S)` over all combinations.

2. **Main Logic in `func_7`:**
   - The main function `func_7` is supposed to orchestrate the computation of the sum `f(S)` across all combinations of K integers from the list A. However, it does not correctly compute the differences (max-min) for the combinations chosen.
   - The sorting of the array and subsequent difference calculations do not correctly account for the specifics of choosing K elements and their corresponding f(S) values.

3. **Handling Modulo Operation:**
   - While the problem requires the result to be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\), the implementation appears to be inconsistent in the application of the modulus operation throughout the various functions.

4. **Missing Combinatorial Logic:**
   - The program fails to properly aggregate the results of `f(S)` for all combinations, as it does not consider every possible combination of K elements and their respective maximum and minimum values.

Due to these issues and the failure to meet the requirements laid out in the problem description, the correctness of the program is not established.
