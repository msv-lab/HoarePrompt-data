Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the required functionality based on the problem description. Specifically, there are several issues that lead to incorrect behavior:

1. **Function Logic Errors**: 
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` all have fundamental issues with their implementation. For instance, `func_1` attempts to add an integer `b` to a list `a`, which is invalid in Python. Similarly, `func_2` attempts to subtract an integer from a list directly, which will also raise an error.
   - `func_3` incorrectly attempts to multiply a list by an integer directly, instead of iterating through the list. The annotations suggest that these functions should work as intended, but the actual implementations lead to runtime errors.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The main function `func_7` does not explicitly handle the case when `N` is 1. According to the problem description, if only one integer is present, `f(S)` would be `0` because the maximum and minimum would be the same. The absence of this check may lead to incorrect results when `N=1`.

3. **Combination Calculations**:
   - The combination calculations in `func_6` rely on valid factorial calculations from `func_3`, which is flawed. The resulting ways to select `K` integers will be incorrect due to the errors in how combinations are computed.

4. **Overall Output**:
   - The computations for `ans` in `func_7` depend on the integrity of the previously defined functions. Since those functions are flawed, the final output will not match the expected output of the problem statement for various test cases, including those provided in the examples.

Given these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in various cases, leading to an overall determination of incorrectness.
