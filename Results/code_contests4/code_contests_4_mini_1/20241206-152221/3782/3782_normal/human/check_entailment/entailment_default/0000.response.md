To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The goal is to compute the sum of `f(S)` over all combinations of `K` integers chosen from `N` integers. Here, `f(S)` is defined as `max(S) - min(S)`, and the result should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Functions Overview
1. **func_1**: Tries to add `b` to `a`, but the implementation is incorrect as it raises an error when executed.
2. **func_2**: Attempts to subtract `b` from the list `a`, which raises an error for the same reason.
3. **func_3**: Multiplies the first element of `a` by `b`, not iterating through the list as one might expect from the description.
4. **func_4**: Implements exponentiation by squaring but does not handle negative or non-integer `b`, which could lead to errors.
5. **func_5**: Appears to call `func_4` without clear context regarding its input, leading to confusion over its output.
6. **func_6**: Calculates combinations based on factorials but relies on correctly implemented factorial calculations.
7. **func_7**: Reads input and performs the main logic, but it does not handle edge cases properly (like when `N` is 1).

### Output Hints
The output hints suggest that the functions are not implemented correctly. For example:
- The hints regarding `func_1` and `func_2` point out the errors in handling list operations, which would lead to runtime errors when executed.
- The description of `func_7` indicates it does not handle edge cases, particularly for scenarios where `N` is less than 2, which is crucial since the computation of `diff` would fail.

### Edge Cases
1. When `N = 1`: The function does not account for this case, which will lead to an error in `func_7` when trying to compute differences between elements.
2. If all elements in the list are the same, it could potentially lead to `f(S)` being zero, and the output calculation might not handle this correctly due to missing edge case handling.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle multiple edge cases correctly and raises errors during execution due to incorrect implementations in various functions. Specifically, functions that manipulate lists are incorrectly formulated, leading to incorrect outputs or runtime errors when executed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for cases like `N=1`, does not handle empty or edge cases properly, and will raise errors when executed due to the faulty logic in the helper functions.
