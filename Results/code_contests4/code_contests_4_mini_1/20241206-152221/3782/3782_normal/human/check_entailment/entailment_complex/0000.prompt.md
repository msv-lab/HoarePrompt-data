You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For a finite set of integers X, let f(X)=\max X - \min X.

Given are N integers A_1,...,A_N.

We will choose K of them and let S be the set of the integers chosen. If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.

Since the answer can be enormous, print it \bmod (10^9+7).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 10^5), and b is an integer K (1 <= K <= N). The absolute value of each integer in a is at most 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers with length N, `b` is an integer K, and `c` is intended to be a list where each element of `a` has `b` added to it. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is reduced by `mod`.
    return c
    #The program returns the list `c`, which contains each element of list `a` with `b` added to it, reduced by `mod` if `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`, but it does not correctly implement the intended functionality. Instead of creating a new list where each element of `a` has `b` added to it, it tries to add `b` directly to the list `a`, which is not valid in Python. Moreover, it checks if the result is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, which is not defined in the provided code. Therefore, the function will raise an error when executed. Thus, it does not return a valid list as described in the annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), and b is an integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ N). The absolute value of each integer in a is at most 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return (a - b) % mod
    #The program returns the result of subtracting integer b from the list a, and then taking the modulus of that result with respect to mod
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`, and returns the result of subtracting `b` from the entire list `a`, and then taking the modulus of each resulting value with respect to a variable `mod`. However, the current code will raise an error because it attempts to perform the subtraction directly on the list `a`, which is not valid in Python. Instead, the function should iterate through each element in `a`, subtract `b`, and then apply the modulus operation. Therefore, the function does not currently operate as described in the annotations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 10^5) where each integer |A_i| is less than or equal to 10^9, and b is an integer K (1 <= K <= N).
def func_3(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the result of multiplying each integer in the list 'a' by the integer 'b' and then taking the modulus with respect to 'mod'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`, and returns the result of multiplying the first integer in the list `a` by `b` and taking the modulus with respect to a defined `mod`. However, it does not iterate through the list `a` as implied by the annotations, meaning it only operates on the first element of `a`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length N (1 <= N <= 10^5), and b is an integer K (1 <= K <= N). Each integer in a is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.
def func_4(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers of length N (1 <= N <= 10^5), and `b` is an integer K (1 <= K <= N). The value of `b` is not equal to 0. Each integer in `a` is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.
    if (b % 2 == 1) :
        return func_3(a, func_4(a, b - 1))
        #The program returns the result of calling func_3 with the list 'a' and the result of calling func_4 with 'a' and 'b - 1', where 'b' is an odd integer and 'b' is not equal to 0.
    else :
        temp = func_4(a, b / 2)
        return temp * temp
        #The program returns the square of the value stored in 'temp', which is the result of 'func_4(a, b / 2)' where 'b / 2' is an integer in the range from 1 to N/2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It returns 1 if `b` is 0. If `b` is an odd integer greater than 0, it recursively calls `func_3` with `a` and the result of `func_4(a, b - 1)`. If `b` is an even integer, it recursively calls `func_4(a, b / 2)` and returns the square of that result. The function does not handle cases where `b` is negative or non-integer types, which could lead to unintended behavior.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a tuple where the first element is a list of integers representing the values A_1, ..., A_N and the second element is a tuple of two integers N and K such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ K ≤ N, and |A_i| ≤ 10^9 for all integers in the list.
def func_5(a):
    return func_4(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of the function func_4 that processes the tuple 'a' containing a list of integers and the integers N and K, with 'mod' adjusted by subtracting 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `a` consisting of a list of integers and a tuple containing two integers \( N \) and \( K \). It returns the result of the function `func_4`, which processes the tuple `a` with a modified value of 'mod' decreased by 2. The specifics of what `func_4` does with this input are not defined in the provided code, so the exact output depends on the implementation of `func_4`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of elements, k is an integer representing the number of elements to choose such that 1 <= k <= n, and fac is a list of integers representing the factorial values used for combinations, where the length of fac is at least n.
def func_6(n, k, fac):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating that no valid combinations can be formed since k is greater than n.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of elements, `k` is an integer representing the number of elements to choose such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, and `fac` is a list of integers representing the factorial values used for combinations, where the length of `fac` is at least `n`. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    return func_3(fac[n], func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])))
    #The program returns the result of the combination calculation using the factorial values at indices n, n-k, and k from the list 'fac'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, along with a list of integers `fac` representing factorial values. It returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`, indicating that no valid combinations can be formed. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the number of combinations of `n` elements taken `k` at a time using the factorial values from the `fac` list. The function assumes that the list `fac` contains valid factorial values for all integers up to `n`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100000, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies -10^9 <= A_i <= 10^9.
def func_7():
    n, k = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    fac = [0] * (n + 5)
    fac[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 5):
        fac[i] = func_3(fac[i - 1], i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `fac[i]` is assigned the value of `func_3` applied cumulatively from `fac[0]` to `fac[N + 4]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `N + 4.
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])
        
        ways = func_6(n, k, fac)
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))
        
        ans = func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is updated based on all iterations, `i` is `N - 2` (or `-1` if `N` is 1), `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[N-1], a[N-2])` (or not calculated if `N` is 1), `ways` is the final computed value based on the last iteration's calculations.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, N and K, and a list of N integers from input. It computes a value `ans` based on the differences between consecutive sorted elements of the list and some combinatorial calculations involving the integers N and K using helper functions (func_1, func_2, func_3, func_6). The function then prints the final computed value `ans`. However, it does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when N is 1, which would lead to an incomplete calculation since `diff` is not computed. It also does not return any values; it only prints the result.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
