The loop iterates from 1 to `N + 4`, which means it will run a total of `N + 4` times. During each iteration, `fac[i]` is assigned the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)`. 

After all the iterations of the loop have executed:
- `N` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000.
- `i` will be `N + 4` in the final iteration.
- Each `fac[i]` will be the result of applying `func_3` to the previous value in the `fac` list and the current index `i`.

Thus, after all iterations, the output state is that `fac[i]` will contain the results of the cumulative application of `func_3` starting from `fac[0]` up to `fac[N + 4]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `fac[i]` is assigned the value of `func_3` applied cumulatively from `fac[0]` to `fac[N + 4]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `N + 4.**
