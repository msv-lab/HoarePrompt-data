To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state provided.

1. The variable `ans` is updated by the function call `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`. This means that `ans` will take on a new value based on the current value of `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`.

2. The variable `diff` is calculated as the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0])`. However, the specific values of `a[1]` and `a[0]` are not given, so we cannot determine a specific value for `diff`.

3. The variable `ways` is updated by the value returned from `func_2(ways, func_6(n - 3, k, fac))`. Again, without knowing the values returned by `func_2` and `func_6`, we cannot determine the final value of `ways`.

4. Since `ans` is being assigned a new value based on functions which depend on values that are not specified, we cannot provide a definite numerical output for `ans`. However, we can indicate that it has been updated based on its previous value and the results from the function calls.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `ans` has been updated but without specific values for `diff` and `ways`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)); `i` is 2; `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0]); `ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(n - 3, k, fac)`**
