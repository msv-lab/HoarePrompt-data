According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means `n` must be greater than 1. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` will be 1 after the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `ans` is updated by `func_1(0, func_3(diff, ways))`, `i` is 1, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0])`, `ways` is updated to `func_2(ways, func_6(n - 1, k, fac))`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
