`fac[i]` is assigned the value returned by `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)`. The variable `i` is currently 3, so `fac[i - 1]` refers to `fac[2]`, and `i` is 3. The specific values of `fac[2]` and the output of `func_3` are unknown, but `fac[3]` will be assigned the result of that function call. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `fac[i]` is assigned the result of `func_3(fac[2], 3)`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `fac[i]` is assigned the result of `func_3(fac[2], 3)`**.
