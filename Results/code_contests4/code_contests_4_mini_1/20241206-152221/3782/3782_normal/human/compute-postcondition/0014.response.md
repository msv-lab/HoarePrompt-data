To simulate the execution of the provided Python code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the code:

Initial State: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is 0.

The code snippet:
```
diff = func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])
```

In this code, `i` is currently 0. Therefore, `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[1]`, and `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. The function `func_2` takes these two values as arguments.

Assuming `a` is a list with at least 2 elements (since `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute), the values `a[0]` and `a[1]` will be used as inputs to the function `func_2`.

However, the specific values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not provided, nor is the implementation of `func_2`. Therefore, we cannot compute a specific value for `diff`.

The output state will reflect that `diff` is being assigned a value that depends on `func_2(a[1], a[0])`, without specifying the result of that function or the exact values of `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `diff` is assigned the value of func_2(a[1], a[0])**
