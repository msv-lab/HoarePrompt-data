The code assigns the value of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` to `fac[i]`. The value of `fac[i - 1]` depends on the previous state of the `fac` array, which is not specified here. However, we know that `i` is currently 1, so `fac[i - 1]` refers to `fac[0]`. The function `func_3` is applied to `fac[0]` and `i` (which is 1). 

Since `N` is a positive integer within the specified range and `i` is initialized as 1, we can infer that the loop is executing for the first time. The other variables' states are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Thus, the output state indicates that `fac[i]` is being effectively computed using the previous value of `fac[0]` and `i` is currently 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `fac[i]` is assigned the value of `func_3(fac[0], 1)`**.
