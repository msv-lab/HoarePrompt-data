The code assigns the value of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` to `fac[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `fac[2]` is assigned the value of `func_3(fac[1], 2)`. However, the value of `fac[1]` is not provided in the initial state, and thus we cannot determine the exact value of `fac[2]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `fac[2]` is assigned the value of `func_3(fac[1], 2)` where `fac[1]` is unknown.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `fac[2]` is assigned the value of `func_3(fac[1], 2)` where `fac[1]` is unknown.**
