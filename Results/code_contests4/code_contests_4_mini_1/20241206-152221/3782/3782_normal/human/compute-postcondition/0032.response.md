The code snippet provided is a print statement, which outputs the value of the variable `ans`. The state of other variables (`N`, `i`, `diff`, `ways`) remains unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Thus, the output state reflects the value of `ans` without modifying any other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `i` is `N - 2` (or `-1` if `N` is 1); `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[N-1], a[N-2])` (or not calculated if `N` is 1); `ways` is the final computed value based on the last iteration's calculations; `ans` is printed.**
