To analyze the provided code snippet, we consider the initial state and the impact of the execution:

1. The variable `ways` is updated by the expression `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`.
2. The value of `i` is currently 2, so `i + 1` equals 3.
3. Therefore, `func_6(i + 1, k, fac)` will be calculated as `func_6(3, k, fac)`.
4. The previous value of `ways` is not specified, but it will be passed to `func_2` along with the result of `func_6(3, k, fac)`.
5. The output state will reflect the updated value of `ways` based on the results of the function calls, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Since we do not have the specific values or results from the functions, we can only state that the value of `ways` has been updated with a new value based on the function calls.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)); `i` is 2; `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0]); `ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(3, k, fac));**
