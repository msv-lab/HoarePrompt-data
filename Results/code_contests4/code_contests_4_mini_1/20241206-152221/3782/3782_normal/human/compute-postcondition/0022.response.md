Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is updated by `func_1(0, func_3(diff, ways)); `i` is 1; `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0]); `ways` is updated to the result of `func_6(N, k, fac); `diff` is updated by `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i]); `ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`.**
