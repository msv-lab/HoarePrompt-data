To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the effects of the assignment and function calls involved.

1. `ways` is initially assigned the value of `func_6(n, k, fac)`. This is the starting value for `ways` based on the initial parameters.
2. The code snippet then assigns `ways` a new value, calculated as `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`.
3. Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` equals 1. Hence, `func_6(i + 1, k, fac)` is equivalent to `func_6(1, k, fac)`.
4. The first argument for `func_2` is the current value of `ways`, which was just calculated from `func_6(n, k, fac)`.
5. The output of `func_2(ways, func_6(1, k, fac))` will assign a new value back to `ways`.

Since we are not given specific values or the results of the functions `func_2` and `func_6`, we can only express the state in terms of function calls and their results.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `diff` is assigned the value of `func_2(a[1], a[0]); `ways` is assigned the value of `func_2(func_6(n, k, fac), func_6(1, k, fac))**.
