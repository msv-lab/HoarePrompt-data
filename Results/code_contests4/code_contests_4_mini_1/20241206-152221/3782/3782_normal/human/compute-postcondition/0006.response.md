According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 5`. 

Since `i` increments by 1 with each iteration, after the current iteration, `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, we need `i` to be less than `n + 5`. Since `i` will be 2, this means `n` must be greater than or equal to -3 (but since `N` is a positive integer, this condition is automatically satisfied). 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than or equal to -3**
