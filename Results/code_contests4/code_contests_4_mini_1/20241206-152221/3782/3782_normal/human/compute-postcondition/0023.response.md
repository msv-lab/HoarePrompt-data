To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we need to consider the initial state of the variables and how they are affected by the execution of the code.

Initial State: 
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; 
- `ans` is updated by `func_1(0, func_3(diff, ways));` 
- `i` is 1; 
- `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0]);` 
- `ways` is updated to the result of `func_6(N, k, fac);` 
- `diff` is updated by `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i]);` 
- `ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac));`

Now, we analyze the impact of the new code line:

```
ways = func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))
```

1. The variable `ways` is reassigned the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`.
2. The value of `n - i - 1` is computed, where `i` is currently 1.
3. Therefore, `n - i - 1 = N - 1 - 1 = N - 2`.
4. The function `func_6(N - 2, k, fac)` is called, which will return some value based on its parameters.
5. Then, `func_2(ways, func_6(N - 2, k, fac))` is executed, which combines the current value of `ways` and the result from `func_6`.

Since we do not have specific values for `N`, `k`, `fac`, or the outcomes of the functions `func_2` and `func_6`, we cannot derive exact numerical values but can describe the relationships.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is updated by `func_1(0, func_3(diff, ways)); `i` is 1; `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0]); `ways` is updated by the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(N - 2, k, fac))`.**
