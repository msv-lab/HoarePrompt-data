Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)); `i` is 2; `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0]); `ways` is updated by the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(N - 2, k, fac)); `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)); for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2; `diff` is updated by `func_2(a[3], a[2]); and `ways` is updated by `func_6(n, k, fac)`.**
