The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It processes a list of integers `A` and two integers `N` and `K` that are presumably defined elsewhere in the program. Based on the provided constraints, `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, and `A` is a list of `N` integers, each of which is in the range from -10^9 to 10^9. 

The function's output is not specified, but it is implied that it calculates or processes the list `A` in relation to the integers `N` and `K`. Since there are no specific cases or return values given in the prompt, we cannot detail any particular output or behavior.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on predefined variables N, K, and A, which must adhere to the specified constraints. The exact output or processing behavior is not defined.**
