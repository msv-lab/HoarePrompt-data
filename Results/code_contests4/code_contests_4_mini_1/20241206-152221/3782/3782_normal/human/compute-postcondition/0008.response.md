According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n + 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` becomes 3. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `n + 5` is greater than 3. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, we conclude that the loop will execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `N` must be greater than -2 (which is always true since N is positive)**
