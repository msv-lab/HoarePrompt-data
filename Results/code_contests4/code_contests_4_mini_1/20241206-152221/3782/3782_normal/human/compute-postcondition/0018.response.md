To assess the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to identify the effects on the variables involved.

1. The variable `ans` will be updated by the function `func_1`, which takes two arguments: `ans` (currently 0) and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`.
2. Before the assignment, we need to evaluate `diff` and `ways`. 
3. `diff` has already been assigned the value of `func_2(a[1], a[0])`, whose specific value is not provided in the initial state. Thus, we denote it simply as `diff`.
4. The variable `ways` is updated to the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - 1, k, fac))`, but since `ways` can change based on its previous state and the outcome of `func_2` and `func_6`, we also denote it as `ways`.

Given that the exact values of `diff`, `ways`, and the output of `func_1` cannot be determined without further information about these functions, we can only describe the state of the variables after the operation.

The output state will reflect that `ans` is updated based on the unknown results of `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_6`. Thus, we maintain the notation for these variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is updated by `func_1(0, func_3(diff, ways))`; `i` is 0; `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0])`; `ways` is updated to `func_2(ways, func_6(n - 1, k, fac))**
