The code assigns the value `1` to `fac[0]`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `fac` at index `0`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `A` is a list of `N` integers satisfying -10^9 <= `A_i` <= 10^9; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `fac` is a list of size `N + 5` initialized with 1 at index 0 and 0s elsewhere.**
