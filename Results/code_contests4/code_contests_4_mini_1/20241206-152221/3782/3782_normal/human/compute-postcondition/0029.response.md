To assess the impact of the given code snippet, we analyze the assignment and function calls involved.

1. `ways` is updated by calling `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`.
2. The value of `i` is 2, which means we need to calculate `n - 2 - 1 = n - 3`.
3. The function `func_6` is called with parameters `n - 3`, `k`, and `fac`.
4. The result of `func_6(n - 3, k, fac)` will be used as the second argument in the `func_2` function.
5. The function `func_2` is called with the current value of `ways` and the result from `func_6`.

Since the operations depend on the specific implementation of `func_2` and `func_6`, we can't determine exact values for `ways` after the update. However, we can state that `ways` is modified based on the output of `func_2` using the result of `func_6`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ways` has been updated, but we don't have exact values for it or other variables directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100000; `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)); `i` is 2; `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[1], a[0]); `ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(n - 3, k, fac))**.
