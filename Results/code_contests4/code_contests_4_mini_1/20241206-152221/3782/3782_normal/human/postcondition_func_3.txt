The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It returns 1 if `b` is 0. If `b` is an odd integer greater than 0, it recursively calls `func_3` with `a` and the result of `func_4(a, b - 1)`. If `b` is an even integer, it recursively calls `func_4(a, b / 2)` and returns the square of that result. The function does not handle cases where `b` is negative or non-integer types, which could lead to unintended behavior.
