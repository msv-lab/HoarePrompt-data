To evaluate the provided program against the given problem description, we need to check if it correctly computes the sum of the differences between the maximum and minimum values of all possible subsets of size K from a list of N integers. 

Upon reviewing the program, I see several issues that could lead to incorrect results:

1. The function `func_6` is responsible for calculating combinations, but it does not handle cases where K is greater than N properly. It returns 0 in such cases, which is correct, but it could lead to misleading results if other parts of the program depend on it.

2. The program calculates `diff` as the difference between adjacent sorted elements, but it does not correctly account for the cases where the minimum and maximum can be the same, especially when selecting subsets. For example, in the case where all chosen elements are the same, `f(S)` should be 0, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. The program assumes that the calculation of ways to choose elements is always correct, but the actual application of these combinations to the `diff` might not yield the correct total due to the previous points.

4. The logic used to calculate `ways` is convoluted and can lead to incorrect results, especially in cases where the distribution of numbers is non-uniform.

To illustrate a potential failing case:
- For the input `3 1` with the numbers `1 1 1`, the expected output should indeed be `0`, since all chosen subsets will yield the same minimum and maximum. However, the program does not correctly account for this condition in its calculations.

Given these points, it is clear that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly and could lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
