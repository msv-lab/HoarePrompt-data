Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic based on the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_7` computes the sum of `f(S)` over all combinations of `K` elements chosen from the list, but it fails to properly calculate the number of ways to select the chosen set `S` for each distinct pair of minimum and maximum values.

Here is a critical issue:

1. The way `ways` is calculated does not correctly account for the number of ways to select elements such that they include the specific minimum and maximum values. The current implementation computes the combination counts for general cases without ensuring that both the smallest and largest elements (min and max) are included when calculating `f(S)`. 

2. In some cases where the minimum and maximum values are the same (like in the input example `3 1` with values `1, 1, 1`), it should yield 0 as `f(S)` because `max(S) - min(S) = 0`. However, the program may incorrectly count such scenarios.

Thus, for the input case where all values are the same, the output should be 0, but the logic in the program may not yield the correct results due to the flawed combination counting, leading to incorrect total sums. 

A specific counterexample can be constructed where N numbers are all the same (e.g., `1 1 1` with K=1), which should return 0, but the program may return a non-zero value due to the incorrect combinations calculation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem and is incorrect.
