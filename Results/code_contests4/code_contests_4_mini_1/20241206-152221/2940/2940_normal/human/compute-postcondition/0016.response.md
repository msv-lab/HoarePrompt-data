The execution of the code raises a `ValueError` due to the condition that `directon` is neither 'North' nor 'South'. The variable values remain unchanged, but the program raises an exception for the invalid `directon`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is 20000, `sat` is True, `i` is 0, `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the input line split by space, and a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid directon'.
