The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. The execution will move to the next loop iteration without executing any further statements in the current iteration. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `i` is incremented by 1, and `dst` and `direction` are assigned values from the file read operation. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
