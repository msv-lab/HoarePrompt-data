Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `i` is less than `n`, `dst` and `directon` are assigned from the line read from the file. If `directon` is 'South', `height` is updated by subtracting `int(dst)` from its previous value. If `directon` is 'North', `height` is updated by adding `int(dst)`. If `directon` is neither 'South' nor 'North', a ValueError is raised due to 'Invalid directon'.***
