Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, and `sat` is True. If `directon` is 'South', then `height` is updated to 20000 - int(dst). If `directon` is 'North', then `height` is updated to 20000 + int(dst). If `directon` is neither 'South' nor 'North', a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid directon'.***
