The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(f.readline())`, where `f` reads a line of input. The specific value of `n` is not known, but it remains an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The other variables (`HEIGHT` and `height`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive; `HEIGHT` is 20000; `height` is 20000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive; `HEIGHT` is 20000; `height` is 20000**
