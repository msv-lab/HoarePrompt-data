The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. For each journey segment, the function also accepts an integer `ti`, which represents the duration of the journey segment and is in the range of 1 to 10^6, along with a string `diri`, which indicates the direction of the journey and must be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East". 

The function's output is not explicitly provided, but based on the described parameters, it likely processes these journey segments in some manner. However, without specific output details, we cannot determine the exact return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 to 50 inclusive) for the number of journey segments, each consisting of an integer `ti` (1 to 10^6) and a string `diri` ("North", "South", "West", "East").**
