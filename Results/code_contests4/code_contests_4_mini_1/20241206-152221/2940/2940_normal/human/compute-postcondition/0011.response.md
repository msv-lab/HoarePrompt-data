The variable `height` is decremented by the integer value of `dst`. The initial value of `height` is 20000, and `dst` is an input value taken from the input line split by space. Since the specific value of `dst` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `height`. Thus, the output state reflects that `height` is decreased by the value of `dst`, which is an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is 20000 - int(dst), `sat` is True, `i` is 0; `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the input line split by space, and the value of `directon` is 'South'.**
