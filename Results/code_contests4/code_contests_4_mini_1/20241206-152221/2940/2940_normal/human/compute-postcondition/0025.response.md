The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration in the most internal loop, the output state remains as it was.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `i` is less than `n`, `dst` and `directon` are assigned from the line read from the file and we skip the current iteration in the most internal loop.**
