The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, and `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
