The value of `height` is incremented by the integer value of `dst`. The value of `dst` is obtained from a file read operation, but since the specific value of `dst` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `height`. Additionally, the other variables are not affected by this operation, and we only know that `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, and `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst` from the file read operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, and `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst` from the file read operation.**
