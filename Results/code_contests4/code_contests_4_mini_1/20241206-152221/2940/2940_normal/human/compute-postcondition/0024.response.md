The line of code reads a line from a file (using `f.readline()`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the resulting string into two parts using the space character as the delimiter. The first part is assigned to `dst` and the second part to `directon`. Since we do not have information about the content of the line being read or the previous values of `dst` and `directon`, we cannot determine their specific values after execution. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `i` is less than `n`, and `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the line read from the file.
