Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, and `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, at which point we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `height` is within the range of 0 to 20000, no changes occur in `sat` or `height`, and the program continues executing.***
