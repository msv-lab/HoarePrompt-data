Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False. If `direction` is 'South', then `height` is less than or equal to the previous height minus `dst`. If `direction` is 'North', then `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst` from the file read operation. If `direction` is not in {'South', 'North'}, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid direction'.***
