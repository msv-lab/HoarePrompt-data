The value of `height` is updated by adding `int(dst)` to it. Since `height` can either be less than 0 or greater than 20000, the new value of `height` will depend on the value of `dst`. The other variables remain unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `i` is less than `n`, `dst` and `directon` are assigned from the line read from the file, and `height` is updated by adding `int(dst)`.
