Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is 20000, `sat` is True, `i` is 0; `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the input line split by space. If `directon` is not 'South' or 'North', we continue to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to the variables.***
