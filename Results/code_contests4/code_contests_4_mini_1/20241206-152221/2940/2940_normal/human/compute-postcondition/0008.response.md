The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables along with the indication that the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is 20000, `sat` is True, `i` is 0; `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the input line split by space. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
