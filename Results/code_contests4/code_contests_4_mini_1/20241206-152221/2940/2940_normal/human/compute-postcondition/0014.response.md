The variable `height` is incremented by the value of `int(dst)`. The initial value of `height` is 20000, and since `dst` is taken from the input, its value is unknown. Therefore, `height` will be 20000 plus the integer value of `dst`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is 20000 + int(dst), `sat` is True, `i` is 0; `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the input line split by space; the value of `directon` is 'North'.**
