The value of `height` is decremented by the integer value of `dst`. The initial state indicates that `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, and `dst` is assigned from a line read from the file. Since the specific value of `dst` is unknown and the previous value of `height` is also not specified, the output state will reflect the decrement operation without exact values.

Output State: **`height` is updated by subtracting `int(dst)` from its previous value.**
