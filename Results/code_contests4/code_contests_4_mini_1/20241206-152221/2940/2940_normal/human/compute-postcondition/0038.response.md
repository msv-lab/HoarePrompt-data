Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, and `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000. If `direction` is not in {'South', 'North'}, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and `i` is incremented by 1 while `dst` and `direction` are assigned values from the file read operation.***
