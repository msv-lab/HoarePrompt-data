Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, and `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000. If `height` is less than 0 or greater than `HEIGHT`, `sat` remains False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
