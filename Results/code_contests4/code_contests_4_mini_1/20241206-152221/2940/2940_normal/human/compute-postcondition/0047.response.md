Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is either True or False depending on whether `height` has stayed within the range of 0 to 20000 throughout all iterations, and `height` is either a value within the range of 0 to 20000 or has gone below 0 or above 20000, causing `sat` to be False.**
