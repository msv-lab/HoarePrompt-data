Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` is False, and `height` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000. If `direction` is 'North', `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst` from the file read operation. If `direction` is not in {'South', 'North'}, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid direction'.***
