The function accepts an integer `n` (1 to 50 inclusive) representing the number of journey segments, where each segment consists of a distance `dst` and a direction `directon`. It only considers movements in the "South" or "North" directions, adjusting a height variable accordingly. The function checks if the height remains within the range of 0 to 20000 throughout the journey. After processing all segments, it returns 'YES' if the final height is exactly 20000 and 'NO' otherwise. The function ignores any segments with directions other than "South" or "North".
