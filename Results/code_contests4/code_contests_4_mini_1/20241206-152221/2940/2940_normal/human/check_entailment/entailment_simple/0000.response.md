Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Movement Restrictions at the Poles**: According to the problem description, if Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South, and if he is at the South Pole, he can only move North. However, the program does not enforce these rules. It allows movements in any direction (West or East) without checking if Limak is at either pole. This violates the conditions set in the problem statement.

2. **Final Position Requirement**: The journey must end at the North Pole. The program checks if the final height equals `HEIGHT` (20000), which is correct, but since the movement can be invalid (as mentioned above), the final check might not represent a valid journey. It could erroneously return "YES" if invalid movements occurred earlier.

3. **Lack of Immediate Checks**: The program uses a loop to process the movements but does not check the condition of being at the North or South Pole before processing each movement. For instance, if Limak is at the North Pole and an instruction is given to move East or West, the program will still execute that instruction, which is against the rules.

4. **Handling of North/South Movement**: The program only processes movements related to North and South, ignoring any changes in position due to East or West. This is incorrect because Limak is expected to move based on complete and valid instructions.

In summary, the program does not enforce the movement constraints when at the poles and allows invalid movements. Therefore, it does not satisfy the requirements specified in the problem description.
