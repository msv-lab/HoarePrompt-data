The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers read from the input. Each integer in the list is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^9. However, since there are no checks in the code for the number of integers read or their validity beyond the specified range, if the input is malformed (e.g., non-integer values), it will raise a ValueError during conversion.
