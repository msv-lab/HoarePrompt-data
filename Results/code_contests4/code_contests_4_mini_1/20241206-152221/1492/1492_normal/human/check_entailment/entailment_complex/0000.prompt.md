You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the i-th one is h_i. Today some villains have set on fire first n - 1 of them, and now the only safety building is n-th skyscraper.

Let's call a jump from i-th skyscraper to j-th (i < j) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i < j and one of the following conditions satisfied: 

  * i + 1 = j 
  * max(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}) < min(h_i, h_j) 
  * max(h_i, h_j) < min(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}). 



At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach n-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — total amount of skyscrapers.

The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, …, h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — heights of skyscrapers.

Output

Print single number k — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

In the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5.

In the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.

Sequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: 1 → 3 → 5.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `dp` is updated to contain the minimum number of operations for each index; `minstack` contains the elements of `ar` that are less than or equal to the current element in order; `maxstack` contains the elements of `ar` that are greater than or equal to the current element in order; `minidx` contains the indices of the elements in `minstack`; `maxidx` contains the indices of the elements in `maxstack`.

    print(dp[n - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and a list `h` of `n` integers (where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ h[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000). It calculates the minimum number of operations needed to transform the sequence in `h` such that each element is either less than or equal to the next or greater than or equal to the next. The function ultimately returns this minimum number of operations as the last element of the `dp` list, which keeps track of the minimum operations for each index.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and h is a list of n integers where each integer h_i satisfies 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers that are read from input, where each integer is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers read from the input. Each integer in the list is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^9. However, since there are no checks in the code for the number of integers read or their validity beyond the specified range, if the input is malformed (e.g., non-integer values), it will raise a ValueError during conversion.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a tuple containing two elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the total number of skyscrapers, and a list of n integers h (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) representing the heights of the skyscrapers.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element is the sum of the corresponding integer from the input and the entire tuple o containing the total number of skyscrapers and their heights.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `o` containing an integer and a list of integers, attempts to read input heights, and tries to return a list of sums of these heights with the entire tuple `o`, but will raise a `TypeError` due to an invalid operation in the addition.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and m is a list of integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers, where each height is in the range 1 ≤ m[i] ≤ 10^9 for i from 0 to n-1.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n elements, each element being the result of func_2()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `m`, and returns a list containing `n` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_2()`. The function does not utilize the list `m` and does not perform any operations based on its contents, which may imply that `m` is irrelevant to the returned result.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a list of integers representing the heights of skyscrapers, and dim is a tuple containing a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), which indicates the total number of skyscrapers. Each height h_i (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) corresponds to a skyscraper.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list generated by calling func_5 with the heights of skyscrapers in list 'f' and the additional dimensions from 'dim' for 'n' times, or returns 'f' if 'dim' is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers representing the heights of skyscrapers and attempts to return a new list generated by recursively calling itself with the heights and additional dimensions specified in a tuple `dim`. However, there are several issues: `dim` is not defined within the function, leading to a potential NameError, and the function's recursive call structure suggests an infinite recursion if `dim` is not handled properly. If `dim` is empty, the function will attempt to call `f()` which is not valid since `f` is a list, potentially resulting in a TypeError. Therefore, the function does not operate as intended based on the annotations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
