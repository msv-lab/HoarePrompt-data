Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to calculate the minimum number of discrete jumps from the first skyscraper to the last according to the problem description.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Misinterpretation of Discrete Jumps:**
   The code is primarily using a dynamic programming approach with two stacks (for min and max heights), but it does not properly account for the conditions that define a discrete jump as specified in the problem description. The problem defines discrete jumps based on strict inequalities between heights, while the code's logic for incrementing the `dp` array does not strictly enforce the conditions required.

2. **Example Cases:**
   - The provided example `5, 100, 1, 100, 1, 100` should yield 2 jumps (from 1 to 3 and then to 5), but the logic involving the dp array and the stacks does not ensure this outcome for all inputs.
   - The function does not adequately check for the conditions of the max and min heights of the skyscrapers between the jumps, which is crucial for determining valid jumps according to the rules given in the problem.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   The annotations mention that the function should cover various edge cases regarding the heights of the skyscrapers, yet the program's handling of these cases is insufficient. For example, if all skyscrapers have the same height, the program may incorrectly compute the number of jumps due to not considering the conditions related to max and min heights properly.

4. **Invalid Function Definitions:**
   There are functions (`func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that do not seem relevant to the problem at hand and do not contribute to the solution. Their presence could indicate a misunderstanding of the task, which further complicates the correctness of the overall solution.

### Conclusion:
Due to the failure to correctly implement the logic for discrete jumps and the potential for incorrect outputs on various test cases, the program cannot be deemed correct for all potential inputs as specified in the problem description.
