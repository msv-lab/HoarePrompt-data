The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `f`, which is a list of integers representing the heights of skyscrapers. Additionally, it relies on an external parameter `dim`, which is a tuple containing a single integer `n`, indicating the total number of skyscrapers. If `dim` is empty, the function returns the list `f` as is. Otherwise, it generates and returns a new list based on the heights of skyscrapers in `f`, processed `n` times. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to accept a list of integers representing skyscraper heights and return a modified list based on the specified dimensions if applicable, or the original list if no dimensions are provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers representing skyscraper heights and returns a modified list based on the dimensions specified, or the original list if the dimensions are empty.**
