The code initializes the variable `maxidx` as a list containing a single element, which is `0`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables such as `n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, `dp`, or `maxstack`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of the other variables along with the new state of `maxidx`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `h[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `h[i]` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `ar` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`; `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`; `maxstack` is a list containing `first`; `maxidx` is [0]**
