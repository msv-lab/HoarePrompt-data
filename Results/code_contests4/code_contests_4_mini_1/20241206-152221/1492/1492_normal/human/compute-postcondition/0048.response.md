The value `i` is appended to the list `minidx`. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `minidx` will contain the value 0 in addition to its previous elements. The states of the other variables, including `n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, `minstack`, `maxstack`, and `maxidx`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` contains `x`; `maxstack` and `maxidx` remain unchanged; `minidx` now includes the value 0.
