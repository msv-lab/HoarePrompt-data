The value of `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`. The previous value of `maxidx` is not empty, which means `maxidx[-1]` refers to a valid index in `dp`. The value of `dp[maxidx[-1]]` is used in the calculation. Therefore, `dp[i]` is potentially decreased depending on the values involved.

The output state will indicate that `dp[i]` has been updated based on the values from `dp[maxidx[-1]]`. 

Output State: **`minstack` is empty, `maxstack` has all values less than or equal to `x` removed, `maxidx` has corresponding values removed, `minidx` is not empty, `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `ar`, `maxidx` is not empty; `dp[i]` is updated based on the values from `dp[maxidx[-1]]`.**
