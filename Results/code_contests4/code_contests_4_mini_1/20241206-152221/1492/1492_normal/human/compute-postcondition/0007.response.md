The variable `minidx` is assigned a list containing a single element, which is 0. The previous state of `minidx` is unknown, but the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `h[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `h[i]` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `ar` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`; `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`; `maxstack` is a list containing `first`; `maxidx` is [0]; `minstack` is [first]; `minidx` is [0].

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `h[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `h[i]` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `ar` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`; `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`; `maxstack` is a list containing `first`; `maxidx` is [0]; `minstack` is [first]; `minidx` is [0].**
