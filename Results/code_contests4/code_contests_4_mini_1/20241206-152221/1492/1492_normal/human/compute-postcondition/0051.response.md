According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ar`, which has at least one element as it is non-empty. The loop iterates over the elements of `ar` using `enumerate`, which means that for every iteration, `i` increments by 1, and `x` gets the value of the current element in `ar`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, indicating that the loop has executed once. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1, and `x` will then be the second element of `ar`. The number of iterations that the loop can perform is limited by the length of `ar`. Since `n` is the length of `ar`, for the loop to execute once more, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`, which is `n`. 

Thus, if the current value of `i` is 0 and since `ar` is non-empty, it is reasonable to state that `ar` must have at least 2 elements to allow for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in `ar`, `minstack` contains `x`; `maxstack` now includes the value `x`; `maxidx` now includes the value 1; `minidx` includes the value 0.**
