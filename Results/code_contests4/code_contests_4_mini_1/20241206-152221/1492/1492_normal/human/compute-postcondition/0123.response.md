Postcondition: ***`maxstack` is empty, `maxidx` is not empty, `minstack` and `minidx` remain empty as all elements greater than `x` have been removed. If `maxidx` is not empty, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1. Additionally, `minstack` is not empty and the top element of `minstack` is equal to `x`.***
