The variable `minidx` is modified by appending the value of `i` to it. The previous state of `minidx` is that it contains the element `[x]`, and since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its value. However, we know that `minstack` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `minidx` now includes an additional item.

Output State: **`maxstack` is not empty, `minstack` is now [x], `minidx` is now [i]**
