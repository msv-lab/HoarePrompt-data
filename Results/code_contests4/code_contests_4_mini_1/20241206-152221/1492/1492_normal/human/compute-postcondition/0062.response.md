Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in `ar`; `minstack` now has one less element and for the loop to execute again, `minstack[-1]` must be greater than `x`; `minstack` has one less element after pop.**
