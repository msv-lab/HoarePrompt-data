The value of `x` is appended to the `maxstack`. The previous state of `maxstack` is unchanged, and its new state will now include the added value `x`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, `i`, `minstack`, `maxidx`, and `minidx`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` contains `x`; `maxstack` now includes the value `x`; `maxidx` remains unchanged; `minidx` includes the value 0.
