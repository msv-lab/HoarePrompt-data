The variable `maxstack` is initialized as a list containing the value of `first`. Since `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`, which is derived from the return value of `func_2()`, `maxstack` will hold the first element of that returned array. Other variables such as `n`, `h`, and `dp` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `h[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `h[i]` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `ar` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`; `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`; `maxstack` is a list containing `first`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `h[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `h[i]` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `ar` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`; `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`; `maxstack` is a list containing `first`.**
