According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `maxstack`. The loop can execute if `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. Right before the loop, `maxstack` is empty, which means there are no elements to check against `x`. In order for the loop to execute at least once, `maxstack` needs to contain at least one element that is less than `x`. Therefore, `maxstack` must be modified to contain an element less than `x`.

State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty; for the loop to execute the first time, `maxstack` must contain at least one element that is less than x**
