Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `dp` is updated to contain the minimum number of operations for each index; `minstack` contains the elements of `ar` that are less than or equal to the current element in order; `maxstack` contains the elements of `ar` that are greater than or equal to the current element in order; `minidx` contains the indices of the elements in `minstack`; `maxidx` contains the indices of the elements in `maxstack`; `dp` has been printed for debugging purposes; the value `dp[n - 1]` has been returned.**
