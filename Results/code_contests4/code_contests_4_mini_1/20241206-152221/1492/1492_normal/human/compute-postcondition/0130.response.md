Postcondition: ***`maxstack` is not empty, if the top element of `maxstack` equals `x`, it is popped along with the top element of `maxidx`, while `minstack` remains empty and `minidx` remains empty. If `maxstack` is empty or the top element does not equal `x`, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
