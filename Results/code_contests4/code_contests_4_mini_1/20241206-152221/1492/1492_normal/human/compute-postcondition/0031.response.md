The `maxidx.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `maxidx` list. Before this operation, `maxstack` has at least one element that is less than `x`, and after popping, `maxstack` will have one less element. The state of `n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, `i`, and `minstack` remains unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` has one less element after popping.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` has one less element after popping.**
