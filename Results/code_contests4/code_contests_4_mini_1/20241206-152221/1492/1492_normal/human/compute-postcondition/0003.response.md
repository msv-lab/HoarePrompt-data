The variable `dp` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n`. The initial state of `n` is between 2 and 300,000, and this initialization does not affect other variables such as `h`, `ar`, or `first`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the initialized variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `h[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `h[i]` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `ar` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`; `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`.**
