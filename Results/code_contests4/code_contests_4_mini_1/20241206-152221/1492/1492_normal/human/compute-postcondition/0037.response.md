The variable `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`. The value of `maxidx` is true, which implies that it has at least one element. Therefore, `maxidx[-1]` refers to the last element of `maxidx`, and the value of `dp[maxidx[-1]]` can be accessed. The final value of `dp[i]` will depend on its previous value and the calculated value from `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `dp[i]` or `dp[maxidx[-1]]`, we only know that `dp[i]` is being updated based on these indices. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` is empty; `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` is empty; `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`.**
