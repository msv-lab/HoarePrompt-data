Postcondition: ***`maxstack` is not empty, and the top element of `maxstack` equals `x`. `maxidx` is not empty, `minstack` is empty, and `minidx` remains empty. If the top element of `minstack` equals `x`, it is popped from `minstack` and `minidx`. If `maxidx` is not empty, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1.***
