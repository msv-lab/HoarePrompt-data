The value of `maxidx` is modified by removing the last element. Given that `maxstack` has one less value, it implies that `maxidx` had at least one element. Therefore, after executing `maxidx.pop()`, `maxidx` is no longer empty. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `minstack` is empty, `maxstack` has one less value, `maxidx` has one less value, `minidx` is empty, `dp[1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0] + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `ar`.

Output State: **`minstack` is empty, `maxstack` has one less value, `maxidx` has one less value, `minidx` is empty, `dp[1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0] + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `ar`.**
