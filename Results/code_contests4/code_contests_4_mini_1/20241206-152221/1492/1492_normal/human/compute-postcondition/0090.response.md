The code `minidx.append(i)` appends the value `i` to the list `minidx`. This operation adds a new element to the existing `minidx`, which affects only that variable. The other variables (`minstack`, `maxstack`, `maxidx`, and `dp`) remain unchanged based on the provided initial state. 

Thus, the Output State is: `minstack` now has `x` appended, `maxstack` remains one element less, `maxidx` remains unchanged, `minidx` has had its top element removed and now has `i` appended, and `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`.

Output State: **`minstack` now has `x` appended, `maxstack` remains one element less, `maxidx` remains unchanged, `minidx` has had its top element removed and now has `i` appended, and `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1.**
