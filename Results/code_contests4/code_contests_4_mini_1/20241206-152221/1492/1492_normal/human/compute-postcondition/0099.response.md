The last element is removed from `minidx` using `minidx.pop()`. The variable `minstack` remains non-empty, and the condition that `minstack[-1]` is greater than `x` does not affect the state of `minidx`. Therefore, the output state is: `minstack` is non-empty, `minstack[-1]` is greater than `x`, and the last element has been removed from `minidx`.

Output State: **`minstack` is non-empty, `minstack[-1]` is greater than `x`, and the last element has been removed from `minidx`.**
