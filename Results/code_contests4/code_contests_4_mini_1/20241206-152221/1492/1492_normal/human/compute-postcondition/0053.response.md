Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in `ar`, `minstack` contains `x`; `maxstack` now includes the value `x`; `maxidx` now includes the value 1; `minidx` includes the value 0. If `i` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
