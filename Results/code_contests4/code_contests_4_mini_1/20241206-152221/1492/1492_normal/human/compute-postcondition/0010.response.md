The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, the impact is limited to the control flow of the program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2()`; `first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `x` is the first element of `ar`; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
