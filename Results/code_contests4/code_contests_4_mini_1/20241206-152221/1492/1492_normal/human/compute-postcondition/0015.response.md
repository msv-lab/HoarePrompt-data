The code `minidx.pop()` removes the last element from the list `minidx`. The initial state mentions that the last element of `minstack` has already been removed, so `minidx` now also has one less element than it initially had. The other variables (`n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); `first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; the last element of `minidx` has been removed.**
