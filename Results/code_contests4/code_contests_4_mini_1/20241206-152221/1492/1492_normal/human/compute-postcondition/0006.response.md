The variable `minstack` is assigned a new list containing the value of `first`, which was previously assigned a value from `ar`. The other variables (`n`, `h`, `ar`, `dp`, `maxstack`, `maxidx`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `first` to `minstack`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `h[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `h[i]` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `ar` is assigned the return value of `func_2()`; `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`; `maxstack` is a list containing `first`; `maxidx` is [0]; `minstack` is [first]**.
