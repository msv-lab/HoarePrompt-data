The `minidx` list has one element removed due to the `pop()` operation. However, the values of the other variables (`n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, `i`, `minstack`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is now one element shorter after popping.
