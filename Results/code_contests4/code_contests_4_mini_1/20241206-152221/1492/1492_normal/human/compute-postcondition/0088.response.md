Postcondition: ***`minstack` is not empty and its top element remains equal to `x`. The `maxstack` has one less element, while `maxidx` remains unchanged. The `minidx` has had its top element removed, and `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. The condition that `maxstack` is not empty holds true, and the top element of `maxstack` was equal to `x` before the pop.***
