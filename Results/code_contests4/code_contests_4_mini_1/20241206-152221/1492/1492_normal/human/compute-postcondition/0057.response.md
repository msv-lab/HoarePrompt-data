The operation `minidx.pop()` removes the last element from the list `minidx`. The previous state indicated that `minidx` included the value 0, so after executing this operation, the value 0 will be removed from `minidx`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in `ar`; `minstack` now has one less element; `maxstack` includes the value `x`; `maxidx` includes the value 1; `minidx` does not include the value 0; `dp[1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0] + 1.**
