The `minidx.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `minidx` list. The output state does not change the values of other variables directly, but it indicates that an element has been removed from `minidx`. Since `minstack` is empty and `maxstack` is empty, those variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` is empty; an element has been removed from `minidx`.**
