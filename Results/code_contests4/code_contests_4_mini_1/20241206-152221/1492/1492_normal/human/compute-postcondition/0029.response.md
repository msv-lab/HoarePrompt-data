According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `maxstack` has been reduced by one element, and `maxidx` has had its last element removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `maxstack` must not be empty, and its last element must be less than `x`.

Since `maxstack` was reduced by one element, we need to ensure that there is still at least one element left in `maxstack` for the loop to proceed. Therefore, we can adjust `maxstack` to have at least one element that is less than `x`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; for the loop to execute again `maxstack` must have at least one element that is less than x**
