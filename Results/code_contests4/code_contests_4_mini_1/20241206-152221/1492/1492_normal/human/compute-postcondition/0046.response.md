Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; if `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` equals `x`, then an element has been removed from `maxstack` and the last element of `maxidx` has been removed. If `maxstack` is empty or the last element does not equal `x`, no changes occur to `maxstack` or `maxidx`.***
