The `maxidx` list is modified by removing its last element using `maxidx.pop()`. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged, so the output state will reflect that `maxidx` has had its last element removed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` is reduced by one element after performing `maxstack.pop(); maxidx` has had its last element removed.**
