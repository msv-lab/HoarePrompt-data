The value of `maxidx` is updated by appending the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The previous value of `maxidx` is unchanged, and it will now include the value 0 as the last entry. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` contains `x`; `maxstack` now includes the value `x`; `maxidx` remains unchanged; `minidx` includes the value 0; `maxidx` now includes the value 0.
