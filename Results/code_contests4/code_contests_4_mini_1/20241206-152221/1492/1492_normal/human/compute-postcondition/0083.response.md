The `minidx.pop()` operation removes the top element from `minidx`, which indicates that the minimum index is being removed from consideration. The other variables `maxstack`, `maxidx`, and `dp` are not affected directly by this operation. The values of `dp` are contingent on the elements of `minidx` and `maxidx`, but since we are only removing an element from `minidx`, we can specify that `minidx` has been updated.

Output State: **`minstack` is not empty; `maxstack` remains unchanged; `maxidx` remains unchanged; `minidx` has had its top element removed; `dp[1]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`; if `maxidx` is not empty, `dp[i]` is updated based on the values from `dp[maxidx[-1]]`.**
