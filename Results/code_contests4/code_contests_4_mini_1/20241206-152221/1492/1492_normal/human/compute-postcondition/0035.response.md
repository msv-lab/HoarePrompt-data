Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` is empty; if `minidx` is true, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`.***
