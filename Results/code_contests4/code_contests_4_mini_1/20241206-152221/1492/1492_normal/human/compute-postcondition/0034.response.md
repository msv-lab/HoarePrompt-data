The code assigns a value to `dp[i]`, which is calculated as the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. The variable `minidx` is a list, and `minidx[-1]` refers to its last element. Since the initial state mentions that `minidx` is true, we can assume that it contains at least one element, so `minidx[-1]` will yield a valid index. The values of `dp[i]` and `dp[minidx[-1]]` are necessary to determine the new value for `dp[i]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` is empty; `minidx` is true; `dp[i]` is updated to min(dp[i], dp[minidx[-1]] + 1)**.
