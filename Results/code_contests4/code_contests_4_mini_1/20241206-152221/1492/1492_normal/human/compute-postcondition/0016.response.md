According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables in `minstack` and the value of `x`. The loop will execute again if there are elements in `minstack` and the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are:
- `minstack` is not empty (since it is in the loop condition).
- The last element of `minstack` must be greater than `x` for the loop to execute again.

Since the statement specifies that the last element of `minidx` has been removed, it does not directly affect `minstack` unless `minidx` is related to `minstack`. However, we cannot make any assumptions about the current state of `minstack` or its elements beyond what has been provided.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to verify that the last element of `minstack` is still greater than `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `x` to be less than the last element of `minstack`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; the last element of `minidx` has been removed and for the loop to execute again, the last element of `minstack` must be greater than x.**
