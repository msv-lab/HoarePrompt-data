Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2()`; `first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `x` is the first element of `ar`; if `i` is 0, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the values of `n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, or `x`.***
