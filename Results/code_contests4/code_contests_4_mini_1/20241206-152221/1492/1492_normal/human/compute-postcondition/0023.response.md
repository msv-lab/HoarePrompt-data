To determine if the while loop can execute one time, we need to analyze the condition `maxstack and maxstack[-1] < x`. 

1. The first part of the condition, `maxstack`, checks if the list `maxstack` is non-empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `maxstack` must contain at least one element. Since it is stated that `maxstack` is currently empty, we need to ensure that it has at least one item.

2. The second part of the condition, `maxstack[-1] < x`, requires that the last element of `maxstack` be less than the variable `x`. However, since `maxstack` is empty, we cannot evaluate this condition until we adjust the state of `maxstack`.

In summary, to allow the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `maxstack` is not empty. We can set `maxstack` to contain at least one element that is less than `x`.

Therefore, we can modify the state as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; for the loop to execute the first time, `maxstack` contains at least one element less than `x`**.
