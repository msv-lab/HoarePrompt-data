The operation `minidx.pop()` removes the last element from the list `minidx`. The initial state specifies that `minstack` is non-empty and that the last element has been removed from `minidx`, which implies that `minidx` must have at least one element before the pop operation is executed.

After executing `minidx.pop()`, the last element of `minidx` will be removed. Since `minstack` is non-empty and has no direct impact on `minidx`, we only focus on the change in `minidx`. The state of `minstack` and its relationship to `x` is not altered by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `minstack` is non-empty, the last element of `minidx` has been removed.

Output State: **`minstack` is non-empty, the last element of `minidx` has been removed.**
