The command `maxstack.pop()` removes the last element from the `maxstack`. Given that the loop is set to execute for the first time and `maxstack` contains at least one element, after this command is executed, the state of `maxstack` will reflect one less element than before. The values of `n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, `i`, and `minstack` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is empty; `maxstack` has one less element than before.**
