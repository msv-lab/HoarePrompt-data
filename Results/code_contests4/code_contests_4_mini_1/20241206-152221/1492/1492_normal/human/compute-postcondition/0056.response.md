The operation `minstack.pop()` removes the top element from `minstack`. The previous state indicates that `minstack` contains an element greater than `x`, but the exact value of that element is not specified. The other variables (`n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, `i`, `x`, `maxstack`, `maxidx`, `minidx`, and `dp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in `ar`; `minstack` now has one less element (previously it contained an element greater than `x`); `maxstack` includes the value `x`; `maxidx` includes the value 1; `minidx` includes the value 0; `dp[1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in `ar`; `minstack` now has one less element; `maxstack` includes the value `x`; `maxidx` includes the value 1; `minidx` includes the value 0; `dp[1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0] + 1.**
