To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while minstack and minstack[-1] > x:
```

1. The loop can only execute if `minstack` is not empty (i.e., `minstack` evaluates to `True`).
2. Additionally, the last element of `minstack` (i.e., `minstack[-1]`) must be greater than `x`.

Given the provided state before the loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000 (this is irrelevant for the loop condition).
- `h` is a list of `n` integers (also irrelevant for our immediate concern).
- `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2()`, which means `ar` contains at least one integer.
- `first` is `ar[0]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is the first element of `ar`, i.e., `x = ar[0]`.
- `dp[i]` assignment may lead to an invalid index access (not relevant for the loop execution condition).

To ensure the loop can execute:
- We need `minstack` to be not empty. Therefore, `minstack` should contain at least one element.
- The last element of `minstack` must be greater than `x`.

Since `x` is set to `ar[0]`, we can conclude that `minstack` must have at least one element that is greater than `ar[0]`.

Thus, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2()`; `first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time, `minstack` must not be empty and `minstack[-1]` must be greater than `x`**.
