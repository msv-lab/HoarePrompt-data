To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` condition: `while minstack and minstack[-1] > x:`.

1. **Condition Check**: The loop can execute if both `minstack` is not empty and the last element of `minstack` (i.e., `minstack[-1]`) is greater than `x`.
2. **Given State**: At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `minstack` has one less element, which implies that it was not empty at that time. However, we do not have direct information about the remaining elements in `minstack` or their values.
3. **Key Variables**: 
   - `x` is the second element in `ar`, which is an integer.
   - Since `minidx` does not include the value `0`, `minstack` might have had elements that were previously larger than `x` but now might not be due to the decrement.

4. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute again, `minstack` must not only be non-empty but also the last element must be greater than `x`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can run one more time, we need to ensure that the last element of `minstack` is indeed greater than `x`. 

Thus, we can't determine the exact value of `minstack[-1]` after one element was removed, but we can state that it needs to be adjusted to ensure `minstack[-1] > x`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in `ar`; `minstack` now has one less element and for the loop to execute again, `minstack[-1]` must be greater than `x`.**
