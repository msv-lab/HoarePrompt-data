Postcondition: ***`minstack` is empty, `maxstack` has all values less than or equal to `x` removed, `maxidx` has corresponding values removed, and `minidx` is not empty. The value of `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. The variable `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000, `h` is a list of `n` integers, and `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `ar`.***
