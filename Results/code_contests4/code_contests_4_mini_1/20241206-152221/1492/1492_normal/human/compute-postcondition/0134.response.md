The variable `maxidx` is updated by appending the value of `i`. The previous states of `maxstack`, `minstack`, and `minidx` are not directly affected by this operation; only `maxidx` changes. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` is not empty, `minstack` is now [x], `minidx` is now [i], and `maxidx` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`maxstack` is not empty, `minstack` is now [x], `minidx` is now [i], and `maxidx` now includes the value of `i`.**
