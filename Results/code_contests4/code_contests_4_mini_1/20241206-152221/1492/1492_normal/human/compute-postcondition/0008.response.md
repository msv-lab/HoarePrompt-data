According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `ar`, which is assigned the return value of `func_2()`. For the loop to execute, `ar` must be a list with at least one element, since `enumerate()` requires an iterable. The variable `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`, implying that `ar` must have at least one element, and thus `first` must be defined. 

Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 300,000, we can assume `func_2()` returns a list of integers of length at least 1. 

For the loop to execute:
- `ar` should be a list with at least one element.
- Since `first` is assigned the value of `ar[0]`, it confirms that `ar` is non-empty.
- The loop index `i` starts at 0, and `x` takes the value of the first element of `ar`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2()`, `first` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`**
