Postcondition: ***`minstack`, `maxstack`, `maxidx`, and `minidx` are updated accordingly. If `i` is 0, `minstack` has `x` appended, `maxstack` has one more element, `maxidx` has `i` appended, `minidx` has `i + 1` appended, and `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`, with `maxidx` also updated to include `i + 1`, while `x` represents the next element in `ar` at index `i + 1`.***
