The `minstack.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `minstack`. Since it is stated that the last element of `minstack` has been removed, this operation will not affect the variables `n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, or `i`. The only change is that the current last element of `minstack` is removed.

Since `minstack` is non-empty before this operation and it is safe to assume that there was an element to pop, it will now be one element shorter. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is now one element shorter after popping.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; `minstack` is now one element shorter after popping.**
