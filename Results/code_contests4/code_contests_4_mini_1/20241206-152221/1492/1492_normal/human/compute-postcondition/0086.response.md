The `maxstack.pop()` operation removes the top element of `maxstack`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that the `maxstack` is not empty and its top element is equal to `x`. The state of `minstack`, `minidx`, and `dp` values remain unchanged except for the removal of the top element from `maxstack`. Therefore, the Output State is: `minstack` is not empty and its top element is equal to `x`, `maxstack` now has one less element, `maxidx` remains unchanged, `minidx` has had its top element removed, and `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. The condition that `maxstack` is not empty still holds true, and the top element of `maxstack` was equal to `x` before the pop.

Output State: **`minstack` is not empty and its top element is equal to `x`, `maxstack` now has one less element, `maxidx` remains unchanged, `minidx` has had its top element removed, and `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. The condition that `maxstack` is not empty holds true, and the top element of `maxstack` was equal to `x` before the pop.**
