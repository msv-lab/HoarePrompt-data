The code `minstack.pop()` removes the last element from the list `minstack`. Since the initial state specifies that `minstack` must not be empty for the loop to execute, we can conclude that there is at least one element in `minstack` prior to this operation. The values of `n`, `h`, `ar`, `first`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. The output state will reflect that the last element of `minstack` has been removed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); `first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 0; the last element of `minstack` has been removed.**
