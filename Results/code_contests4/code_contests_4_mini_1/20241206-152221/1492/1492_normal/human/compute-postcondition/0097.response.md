To determine the conditions needed for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `minstack and minstack[-1] > x`.

1. **Understanding the condition**: 
   - The loop will execute if `minstack` is not empty (i.e., `minstack` evaluates to `True`) and the top element of `minstack` (i.e., `minstack[-1]`) is greater than `x`.

2. **Current state**: 
   - The state indicates that `minstack`, `maxstack`, `maxidx`, and `minidx` are updated accordingly, and `dp[i]` has been updated, but we don't have specific values for these variables.

3. **Adjustments needed**: 
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `minstack` must be non-empty, and its last element must be greater than `x`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `minstack` contains at least one element and that this element is greater than `x`.

Given these observations, we can formulate the necessary conditions for the state to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`minstack` is non-empty and `minstack[-1]` is greater than `x`**
