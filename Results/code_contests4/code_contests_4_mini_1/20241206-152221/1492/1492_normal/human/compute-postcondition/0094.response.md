The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `minstack` now has `x` appended, `maxstack` has one more element, `maxidx` has `i` appended, `minidx` has `i + 1` appended, `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`, and `maxidx` has `i + 1` appended, for the loop to execute a second time, `x` is the next element in `ar` at index `i + 1`.

Output State: **`minstack` now has `x` appended, `maxstack` has one more element, `maxidx` has `i` appended, `minidx` has `i + 1` appended, `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`, and `maxidx` has `i + 1` appended, for the loop to execute a second time, `x` is the next element in `ar` at index `i + 1`.**
