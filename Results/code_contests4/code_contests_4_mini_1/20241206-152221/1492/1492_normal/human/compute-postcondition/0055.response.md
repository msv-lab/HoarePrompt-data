According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition of `minstack` and the comparison between the last element of `minstack` and `x`. The loop can execute as long as `minstack` is not empty and the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`.

Right before the loop, `minstack` contains the value `x`, which means that the last element of `minstack` is equal to `x`. For the loop to execute the first time, the last element of `minstack` must be greater than `x`. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `minstack` should contain an element greater than `x`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `ar` is a non-empty list of integers returned from `func_2(); first` is `ar[0]`; `i` is 1; `x` is the second element in `ar`; `minstack` contains an element greater than `x`; `maxstack` now includes the value `x`; `maxidx` now includes the value 1; `minidx` includes the value 0; `dp[1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0] + 1**.
