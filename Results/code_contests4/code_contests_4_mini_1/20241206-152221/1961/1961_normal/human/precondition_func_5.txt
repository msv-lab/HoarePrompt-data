The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case has three integers n (number of elements), m (your position in line), and k (number of people whose choices you can fix), with constraints 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. Following this, there is a list of n positive integers representing the elements of the array, where each element is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
