t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3500) representing the number of elements in the array, m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n) representing your position in line, and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) representing the number of people whose choices you can fix. Additionally, a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
