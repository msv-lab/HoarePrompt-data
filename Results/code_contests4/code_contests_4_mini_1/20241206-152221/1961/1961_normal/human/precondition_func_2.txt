t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n (the number of elements in the array) is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3500, m (your position in line) is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and k (the number of people whose choices you can fix) is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; the array consists of n positive integers a_i where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
