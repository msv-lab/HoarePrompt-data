The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing three integers n (the number of elements in the array), m (your position in line), and k (the number of people whose choices you can fix), where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. Additionally, each test case includes an array of n positive integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.
