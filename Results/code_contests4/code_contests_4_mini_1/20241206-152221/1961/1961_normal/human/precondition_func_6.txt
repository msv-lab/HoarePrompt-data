The input consists of multiple test cases where each test case includes n (the number of elements in the array), m (your position in line), and k (the number of people whose choices you can fix), followed by an array of n positive integers. The constraints are 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for elements a_i in the array. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
