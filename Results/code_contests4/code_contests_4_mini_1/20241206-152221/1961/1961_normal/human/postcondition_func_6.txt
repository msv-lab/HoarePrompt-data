The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and does not return any value. It prints the values of the input parameters (n, m, k, and the array) as a space-separated string if the debug flag is true. The function itself lacks any logic to process these inputs or return a result based on them, meaning it only serves to display the inputs in a debug context.
