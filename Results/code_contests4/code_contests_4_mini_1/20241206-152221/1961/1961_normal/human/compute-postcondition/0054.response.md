The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `lcut` and `rcut` are non-negative integers, `ans` is either 10000000000.0 or the minimum of `ans` and the maximum of `A[i]` and `A[i + seglen - 1]`, `pri_idx` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop.
