The values of the variables do not change but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `lcut` is assigned the value `max(0, pl - l + 1)`; `rcut` is a non-negative integer based on the values of `r` and `pr`; either `lcut` is equal to 0 or `rcut` is equal to 0 (or both), and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
