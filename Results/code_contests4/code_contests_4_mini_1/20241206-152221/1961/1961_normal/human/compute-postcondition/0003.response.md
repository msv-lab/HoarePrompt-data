The variable `rcut` is assigned the value `max(0, r - pr + 1)`. The state of `lcut` is not directly affected by this assignment. However, we need to consider the values of `r` and `pr` to determine the possible outcomes for `rcut`. The value of `rcut` will be either 0 or a positive integer depending on the values of `r` and `pr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `lcut` is assigned the value `max(0, pl - l + 1)`; `rcut` is either a non-negative integer based on the values of `r` and `pr`.

Output State: **`lcut` is assigned the value `max(0, pl - l + 1)`; `rcut` is either a non-negative integer based on the values of `r` and `pr`.**
