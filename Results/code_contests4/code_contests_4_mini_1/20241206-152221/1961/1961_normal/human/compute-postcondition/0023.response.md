Postcondition: ***`lcut` is assigned the value `max(0, pl - l + 1)` and `rcut` is either 0 or a positive integer based on `max(0, r - pr + 1)`. If `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0, then `pi` is incremented by 1, and `v`, `pl`, `pr` are assigned the values from `prilist[pi]`, continuing to the next iteration of the loop.***
