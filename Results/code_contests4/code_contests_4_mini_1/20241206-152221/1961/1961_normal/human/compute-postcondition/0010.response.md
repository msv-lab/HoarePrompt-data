Postcondition: ***`lcut` is assigned the value `max(0, pl - l + 1)`, `rcut` is a non-negative integer based on the values of `r` and `pr`, and `ans` is updated to `max(0, func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen))` if `lcut` is less than or equal to `k` and `r - pl` is greater than or equal to `seglen`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
