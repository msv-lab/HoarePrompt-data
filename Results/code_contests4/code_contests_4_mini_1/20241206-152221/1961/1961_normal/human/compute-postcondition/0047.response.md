The value of `ans` is assigned the value `10000000000.0`. The previous values of `lcut`, `rcut`, and `pri_idx` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `lcut` is a non-negative integer based on the values of `pl` and `l`, `rcut` is a non-negative integer based on the values of `r` and `pr`, `ans` is 10000000000.0, and `pri_idx` is unchanged.

Output State: **`lcut` is a non-negative integer based on the values of `pl` and `l`, `rcut` is a non-negative integer based on the values of `r` and `pr`, `ans` is 10000000000.0, and `pri_idx` is unchanged.**
