You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your n - 1 friends have found an array of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. You have decided to share it in the following way: All n of you stand in a line in a particular order. Each minute, the person at the front of the line chooses either the first or the last element of the array, removes it, and keeps it for himself. He then gets out of line, and the next person in line continues the process.

You are standing in the m-th position in the line. Before the process starts, you may choose up to k different people in the line, and persuade them to always take either the first or the last element in the array on their turn (for each person his own choice, not necessarily equal for all people), no matter what the elements themselves are. Once the process starts, you cannot persuade any more people, and you cannot change the choices for the people you already persuaded.

Suppose that you're doing your choices optimally. What is the greatest integer x such that, no matter what are the choices of the friends you didn't choose to control, the element you will take from the array will be greater than or equal to x?

Please note that the friends you don't control may do their choice arbitrarily, and they will not necessarily take the biggest element available.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of elements in the array, your position in line and the number of people whose choices you can fix.

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.

Output

For each test case, print the largest integer x such that you can guarantee to obtain at least x.

Note

In the first test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the last element and the second person to take the first element.

  * the first person will take the last element (5) because he or she was forced by you to take the last element. After this turn the remaining array will be [2, 9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * the second person will take the first element (2) because he or she was forced by you to take the first element. After this turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * if the third person will choose to take the first element (9), at your turn the remaining array will be [2, 3, 8] and you will take 8 (the last element); 
  * if the third person will choose to take the last element (8), at your turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3] and you will take 9 (the first element). 



Thus, this strategy guarantees to end up with at least 8. We can prove that there is no strategy that guarantees to end up with at least 9. Hence, the answer is 8.

In the second test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the first element. Then, in the worst case, both the second and the third person will take the first element: you will end up with 4.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) and a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing multiple test cases. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) and a list of n positive integers. The function currently only writes the input `s` to standard output and does not perform any processing or return results for the test cases. Therefore, it lacks any functional logic to handle or analyze the test cases as described in the annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of tuples, each containing three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) followed by a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `s`, where each tuple contains three integers followed by a list of positive integers, and it writes the entire input to standard output, followed by a newline. The function does not perform any further processing or criteria checks on the input data.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n (the number of elements in the array) is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3500, m (your position in line) is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and k (the number of people whose choices you can fix) is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; the array consists of n positive integers a_i where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return int(readln().strip())
    #The program returns a positive integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases, n, m, or k as provided in the read line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user and returns a positive integer that represents the number of test cases, n (the number of elements in the array), m (your position in line), or k (the number of people whose choices can be fixed), as provided in the input. The function does not explicitly handle any of the other parameters t, n, m, or k; it only returns a single integer read from input, which is not guaranteed to correspond to any specific parameter.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case includes three integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3500), m (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), followed by a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers created by converting each element from the input line into an integer. This input line consists of three integers followed by n positive integers, all separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input consisting of three integers followed by a list of positive integers, all separated by spaces. It processes this input and returns a map object of integers created by converting each element from the input line into an integer. Note that the function does not handle or validate the input directly; it purely converts the input line into integers. If the input format is incorrect, it may raise an error during conversion.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing three integers n (the number of elements in the array), m (your position in line), and k (the number of people whose choices you can fix), where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. Additionally, each test case includes an array of n positive integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_5():
    return readln().strip()
    #The program returns a string input after stripping whitespace from the input line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from it. The function does not validate input or handle any specific edge cases related to input format or content, it simply returns what is read from the input.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case has three integers n (number of elements), m (your position in line), and k (number of people whose choices you can fix), with constraints 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. Following this, there is a list of n positive integers representing the elements of the array, where each element is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of integers from the input, which consists of multiple test cases, where each test case includes three integers n, m, k, followed by n positive integers representing the elements of the array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept parameters directly; it reads input consisting of multiple test cases where each test case includes three integers n, m, k, followed by n positive integers representing the elements of the array. It returns a list of integers that are read from the input. However, it does not perform any validation on the input values or handle potential errors, such as incorrect input formats or invalid integer values.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases where each test case includes n (the number of elements in the array), m (your position in line), and k (the number of people whose choices you can fix), followed by an array of n positive integers. The constraints are 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for elements a_i in the array. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is the number of elements in the array, `m` is your position in line, `k` is the number of people whose choices you can fix, and the array consists of `n` positive integers. If `debug` is true, the output will be a string of these integers joined by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and does not return any value. It prints the values of the input parameters (n, m, k, and the array) as a space-separated string if the debug flag is true. The function itself lacks any logic to process these inputs or return a result based on them, meaning it only serves to display the inputs in a debug context.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers representing the left and right indices of the subarray, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of people whose choices can be fixed, A is a list of integers representing the array elements, prilist is a list of indices of the people whose choices are fixed, pri_idx is an integer representing the current index in prilist, and seglen is an integer representing the length of the segment being considered.

        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lcut` is a non-negative integer based on the values of `pl` and `l`, `rcut` is a non-negative integer based on the values of `r` and `pr`, `ans` is determined by the maximum value returned from the function `func_8` or remains 0 if none of the conditions were met, `pri_idx` is the final index after processing all applicable indices in `prilist`, and if the loop does not execute, `lcut` and `rcut` remain 0, `ans` is 0, and `pri_idx` is unchanged.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lcut` and `rcut` are non-negative integers, `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of `A[i]` and `A[i + seglen - 1]` for valid `i`, and `pri_idx` remains unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value of 'ans', which is based on the maximum of 'A[i]' and 'A[i + seglen - 1]' for valid 'i', with 'pri_idx' remaining unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `l`, `r`, `k`, and `seglen`, a list of integers `A`, and a list of indices `prilist` with an index `pri_idx`. It recursively calculates values based on the maximum number of fixed choices and segments in the array `A`. The final result is derived from the minimum of the maximum values in subarrays defined by `seglen`, or 0 if the conditions for valid segments are not met. The function handles cases where no valid segments exist or when the number of fixed choices exceeds the available options, returning a non-negative integer accordingly.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
