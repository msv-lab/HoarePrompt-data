Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement any logic to handle or analyze the test cases as described in the problem statement. The functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`) primarily focus on reading input and outputting it without performing any computation or decision-making based on the conditions outlined in the problem description.

The problem specifically requires determining the largest integer \( x \) such that the user can guarantee to obtain at least \( x \) from the array after making optimal choices while considering the actions of the friends. However, none of the functions implement this logic; they only output the input data.

For example:
- There is no implementation that ensures the user can fix the choices of friends and calculate the minimum guaranteed value that the user can obtain, which is the core requirement of the problem.
- The annotations highlight that the functions merely write out the input or return integers without processing the conditions and constraints required to solve the problem.

Since the code lacks the necessary functionality to evaluate the described scenarios and produce the correct outputs, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is false.
