The function accepts input consisting of three integers followed by a list of positive integers, all separated by spaces. It processes this input and returns a map object of integers created by converting each element from the input line into an integer. Note that the function does not handle or validate the input directly; it purely converts the input line into integers. If the input format is incorrect, it may raise an error during conversion.
