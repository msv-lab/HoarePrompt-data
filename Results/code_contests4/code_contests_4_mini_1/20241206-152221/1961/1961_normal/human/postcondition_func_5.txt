The function does not accept parameters directly; it reads input consisting of multiple test cases where each test case includes three integers n, m, k, followed by n positive integers representing the elements of the array. It returns a list of integers that are read from the input. However, it does not perform any validation on the input values or handle potential errors, such as incorrect input formats or invalid integer values.
