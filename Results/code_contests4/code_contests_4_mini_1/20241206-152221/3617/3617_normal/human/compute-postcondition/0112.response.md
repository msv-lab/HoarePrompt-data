Output State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is less than `i`, `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1; m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it; `right` remains the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1.**
