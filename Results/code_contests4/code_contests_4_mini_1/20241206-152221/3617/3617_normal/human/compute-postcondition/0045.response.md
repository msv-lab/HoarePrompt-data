The value of `left` is incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, where `j` is 0 and `i` is at least 2. Therefore, `left` becomes `0 + abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `2`, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `i + 1` to `N - 1`, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `2`, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `i + 1` to `N - 1`, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`, `j` is 0**
