According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is a positive integer (which is at least 1, since it is a positive integer + 1). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 1**
