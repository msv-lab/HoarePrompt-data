The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not given, but we know that `j` is 1 and `i` is 2. Therefore, `left` is updated based on the values of `diff` at these indices.

Since `N`, `m`, and `line` are not affected by this operation, the output state will reflect the change in the value of `left`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is 2, `left` is updated, `j` is 1, and `left` is increased by abs(diff[1] - diff[2]).**
