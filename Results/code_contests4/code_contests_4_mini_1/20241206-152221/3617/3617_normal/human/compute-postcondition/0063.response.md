To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which depends on the variable `line`. The loop continues executing as long as `line` is not empty. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `line` has been assigned the value of the next line read from standard input, stripped of the trailing newline character. For the loop to execute again, `line` must not be empty after this assignment.

Since we do not have any information about the current value of `line`, we need to ensure that `line` is set to a non-empty value for the next iteration.

Thus, we need to modify the state to indicate that `line` is a non-empty string.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` contains `N` values; the minimum value from `m` is printed, and for the loop to execute again, `line` is a non-empty string**.
