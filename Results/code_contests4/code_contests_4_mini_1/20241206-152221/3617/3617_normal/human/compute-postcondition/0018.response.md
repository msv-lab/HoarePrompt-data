According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1` and continues until `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0, and since `N` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, which means it will be `i + 2`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be such that `j = i + 2` is still less than `N`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `N - 2`.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 0, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `N - 2, j` is `i + 2; right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
