The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is `i + 1`, this means we are accessing two consecutive elements in the sorted list `diff`. Since `diff` is already sorted, `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` will yield a non-negative value.

The previous value of `right` is 0, and the new value will be `right + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `right` based on this calculation, while other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences calculated from `A` with respect to `N + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences, `right` is the previous value incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `j` is `i + 1` (at least 2)**.
