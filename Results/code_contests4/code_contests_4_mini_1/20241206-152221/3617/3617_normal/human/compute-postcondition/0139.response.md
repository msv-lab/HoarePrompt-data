The variable `right` is assigned the value of `0`, which means it is explicitly initialized to `0`. The values of other variables such as `N`, `m`, `line`, `diff`, `i`, and `left` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of the other variables along with the initialization of `right`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences calculated from `A` with respect to `N + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences, `right` is 0**.
