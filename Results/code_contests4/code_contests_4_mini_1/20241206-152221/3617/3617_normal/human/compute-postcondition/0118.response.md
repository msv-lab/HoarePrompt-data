According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `N`. The loop starts with `j` equal to `i + 1` and continues until `j` is less than `N`. Given that `N` is greater than `i + 2`, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2` (since it was incremented in the previous iteration). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to `i + 2 + 1`, which is `i + 3`. 

We need to ensure that `j`, which is now `i + 2`, is less than `N`. Since `N` is greater than `i + 2`, it implies that `N` is also greater than `i + 3`. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`N` is greater than `i + 3; `i` is a positive integer + 1; `j` is `i + 3; `left` is the sum of the absolute differences for `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1; `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it; `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
