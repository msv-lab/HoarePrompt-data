According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is at least 1, as the range for `j` is from 0 to `i - 1`. Given the initial state indicates that `i` is a positive integer + 1, it ensures that `i` is at least 2, which means the loop will execute for `j` values of 0 and 1 up to `i - 1`.

At the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `j` is now 0.

State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is now a positive integer + 1, `j` is 0, `right` is the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1; m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it; `left` is 0**
