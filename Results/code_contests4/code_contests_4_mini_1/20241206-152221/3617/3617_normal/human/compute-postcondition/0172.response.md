According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again if `j` can take on the next value in the range defined by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so `j` has taken on the values 0, 1, and 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 3, and `i` must remain 3. The variable `N` is at least 4, which allows for `j` to reach the value of 3.

State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 3, `N` is at least 4, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `right` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute a fourth time `j` must be 3.**
