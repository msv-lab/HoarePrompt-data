According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2` (since `j` was set to `i + 2` before the last iteration). Given that `N` is greater than `i + 2`, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `i + 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`N` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is `i + 3`, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`**
