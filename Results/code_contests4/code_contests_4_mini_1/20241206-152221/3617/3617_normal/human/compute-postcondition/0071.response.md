In the given code, `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The initial values provided are:

- `N` is a positive integer
- `m` is an empty list
- `line` is a non-empty string
- `diff` is a sorted list of differences
- `i` is 1
- `left` is 0
- `j` is 0 for the first loop execution

Now, we will compute the new value of `left`:

1. The current value of `left` is 0.
2. The value of `diff[j]` is `diff[0]`.
3. The value of `diff[i]` is `diff[1]`.
4. The operation performed is `left += abs(diff[0] - diff[1])`.

Since `diff` is a sorted list, `diff[0]` and `diff[1]` are the first two elements of that list. The absolute difference is computed, and then added to `left`.

After executing this line of code:

- `left` will now hold the value of `abs(diff[0] - diff[1])`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is 1, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[1])`, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is 1, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[1])`, `j` is 0**.
