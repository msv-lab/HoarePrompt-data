The variable `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The value of `j` is 2, so `diff[j]` is `diff[2]`, and `i` is greater than 2, meaning `diff[i]` is referencing an index greater than 2. 

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `left` (previous value not specified, but will be updated)
- `diff` (a sorted list of differences, with at least 3 elements due to `i` being greater than 2)

This calculation modifies `left` by adding the absolute difference calculated from the specified indices of the `diff` list.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `left` has changed, while other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is greater than 2, `left` is updated by adding `abs(diff[2] - diff[i])`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences for the index `i` if applicable, and `j` is 2.**
