The variable `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is at least 3 and `i` is at least 1, we can calculate the new value of `right`. The previous value of `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 2, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 1, `left` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences, `right` is the previous value incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, and `j` is at least 3.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 1, `left` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences, `right` is the previous value incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `j` is at least 3.**
