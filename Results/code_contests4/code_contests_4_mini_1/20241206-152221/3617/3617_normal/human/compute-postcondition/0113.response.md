`right` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `right` is unknown, but it is now explicitly set to `0`. The states of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `left`, `m`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is less than `i`, `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1`, `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it, `right` is now 0.
