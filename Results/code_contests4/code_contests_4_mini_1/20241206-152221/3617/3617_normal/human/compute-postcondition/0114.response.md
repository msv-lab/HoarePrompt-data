According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `N` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `N`, which is already ensured by the provided state (`N` is greater than `i + 1`). Therefore, the loop can start executing from `j = i + 1`.

At the beginning of the loop, `j` should be initialized to `i + 1`, which is correct as per the loop definition. The states of `left`, `m`, and `right` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they provide context regarding the calculations that may occur within the loop body.

Thus, the relevant states for the loop to execute are:
- `N` is greater than `i + 1` (ensuring that the loop has valid range to execute).
- `j` is initialized to `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is `i + 1`, `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1`, `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it, `right` is now 0**
