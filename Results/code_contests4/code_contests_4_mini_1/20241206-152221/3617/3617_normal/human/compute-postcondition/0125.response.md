According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `line`. If `line` is not empty (or evaluates to true), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is the input read from standard input without the trailing newline. Since there is no information indicating that `line` has become empty after the last iteration, we cannot assume that it will remain non-empty. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `line` must still contain input.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the condition that `line` must not be empty needs to be satisfied.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences for each index from 0 to N-1, `line` is not empty, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is equal to `N`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences for the index `i-1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences for the index `i` if applicable, and the minimum value of `m` is printed.**
