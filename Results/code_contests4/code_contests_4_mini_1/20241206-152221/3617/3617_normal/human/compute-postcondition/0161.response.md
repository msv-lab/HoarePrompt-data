The variable `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous value of `right` is not specified but will be incremented by `abs(diff[4] - diff[2])`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 2, `left` is the sum of absolute differences calculated from `diff[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`, `right` is updated, and `j` is 4.
