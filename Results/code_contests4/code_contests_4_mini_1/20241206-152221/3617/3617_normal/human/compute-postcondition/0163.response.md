Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 2, `left` is the sum of absolute differences calculated from `diff[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`, `right` is updated, `j` is 5, `N` is greater than 5; `right` is updated by adding `abs(diff[5] - diff[2])`.**
