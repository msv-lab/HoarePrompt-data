The value of `line` is assigned the result of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')`, which reads a line from standard input and removes the trailing newline character. The previous values of `m` are not affected, as this operation does not change the list or its contents. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences calculated for each index from 0 to `N-1`; the minimum value of `m` has been printed; `line` is the input line read without the newline character.

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences calculated for each index from 0 to `N-1`; the minimum value of `m` has been printed; `line` is the input line read without the newline character.**
