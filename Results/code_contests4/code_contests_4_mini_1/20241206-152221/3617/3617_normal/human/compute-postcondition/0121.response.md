Output State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1; `i` is a positive integer + 1; `j` is greater than or equal to `N`; `left` is the sum of the absolute differences for `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1; `m` includes the values from `left + right` appended for all iterations; `right` is the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1; `m` now includes `left + right` for this iteration.**
