According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the values of `j` and `N`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `4`, and `N` is greater than `4`. 

Since `j` starts at `i + 1`, and `i` is at least `2`, this means `j` starts at least from `3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. If `j` is at least `4`, it will be incremented to `5`. 

For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `5`. 

State: **`N` is greater than `5`, `i` is at least `2`, `j` is 5, `right` is updated by adding abs(diff[i - 1] - diff[i]) and now increased by abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
