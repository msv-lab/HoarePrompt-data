The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, storing these integers in the list `A`. The initial state mentions that `m` contains `N` values, but the specific values of `m` are not provided. The variable `line` is a non-empty string and does not affect the execution of this code.

Therefore, after executing the code, we can assume that `A` will contain `N` integers based on the input received from `raw_input()`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer; `m` contains `N` values; `line` is a non-empty string; `A` contains `N` integers from input.**
