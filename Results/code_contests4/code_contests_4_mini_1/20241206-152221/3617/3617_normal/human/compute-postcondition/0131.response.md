The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. Since `left` initially holds the sum of absolute differences for the index `i-1`, and the operation sets it explicitly to `0`, this indicates that the previous calculation for `left` has been reset. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 0, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences calculated from `A` with respect to `N + 1`, `i` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is the sum of absolute differences for the index `i` if applicable, `A` is a list of integers created from the input values.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences calculated from `A` with respect to `N + 1`, `i` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is the sum of absolute differences for the index `i` if applicable, `A` is a list of integers created from the input values.**
