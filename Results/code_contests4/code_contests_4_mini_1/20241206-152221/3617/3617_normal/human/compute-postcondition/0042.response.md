According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than `0` and `i` is at least `1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` is at least `1`, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be increased to at least `2`. Therefore, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N`, which means `N` must be greater than `1`.

State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `2`, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `i + 1` to `N - 1`, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to `i - 1`; `m` is updated to include the value `left + right` for the loop to execute a second time.**
