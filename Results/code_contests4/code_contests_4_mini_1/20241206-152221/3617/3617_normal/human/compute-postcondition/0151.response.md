The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The value of `j` is currently 0 and `i` is 2. Therefore, `left` becomes `left + abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`. The previous value of `left` is 0, so the new value of `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`. The other variables, including `m`, `line`, `diff`, `right`, and `i`, remain unchanged in this operation. 

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 2, `left` is abs(diff[0] - diff[2]), `right` is the total of absolute differences calculated from `diff[j]` for all `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1, `j` is 0**
