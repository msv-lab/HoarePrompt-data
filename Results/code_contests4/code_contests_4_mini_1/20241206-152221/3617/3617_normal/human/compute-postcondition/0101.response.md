In the given code, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. The values of `i` and `j` are already defined as `i` being a positive integer + 1 and `j` being `i + 3`. The initial state mentions that `N` is greater than `i + 3`, which implies that `j` is less than `N`.

The calculation involves the absolute difference between the values at indices `j` and `i` in the `diff` array. Since we do not have the specific values of `diff`, we cannot calculate the exact numeric change in `right`.

Thus, we can conclude that `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is `i + 3`, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`**
