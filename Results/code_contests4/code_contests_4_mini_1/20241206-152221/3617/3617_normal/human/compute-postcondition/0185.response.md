The `print(min(m))` statement outputs the minimum value from the list `m`. The previous values of `m` contain the sum of absolute differences calculated for each index from 0 to `N-1`. Since `m` is not empty and `min(m)` computes the minimum value from it, the output state reflects that the minimum value has been determined but does not change any other variable.

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences calculated for each index from 0 to `N-1`; the minimum value of `m` has been printed.**
