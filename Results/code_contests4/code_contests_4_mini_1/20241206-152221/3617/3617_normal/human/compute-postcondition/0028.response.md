According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from 0 to `i - 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, which means the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, resulting in `i` being at least 0.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we note that since `j` will take values from 0 to `i - 1`, the new value of `j` will be 0 when the loop executes one more time. Consequently, `left` will now include the sum of `abs(diff[0] - diff[i - 1])` in this context.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from i + 1 to N - 1 if i < N - 1; otherwise `right` is 0, `m` now contains the value of left + right, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[0] - diff[i - 1])**
