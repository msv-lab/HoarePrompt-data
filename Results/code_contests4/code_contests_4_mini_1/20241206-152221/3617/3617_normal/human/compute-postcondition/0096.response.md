According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `N`, which means that `j` must start from `i + 1` and there must be at least one valid value for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. Since `i` is a positive integer + 1, we can infer that `i` is at least 1 (i.e., i = 1, j = 0). 

For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`. Given that `i` is a positive integer + 1, and assuming `i = 1`, `N` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Thus, we need to adjust the states to ensure:
- `N` is greater than `i + 1` (which ensures at least one iteration).
- `j` is initialized to `i + 1` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is `i + 1`**
