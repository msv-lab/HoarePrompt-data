According to the code, the loop executes based on the range defined by `i`. Since `i` is currently 1, the range for `j` is `range(0, 1)`, which means the loop has executed once with `j` being 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to increment to 1. However, since `j` is defined to iterate from 0 to `i - 1`, the limit for `j` is determined by the value of `i`. As `i` is currently 1, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be increased to at least 2. 

Thus, the adjusted state will be:
State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is 2, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[1])`, `j` is 0**
