Output State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `1`, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `i + 1` to `N - 1`, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to `i - 1`; `m` is updated to include the value `left + right`.**
