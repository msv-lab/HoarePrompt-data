The assignment `right = 0` sets the variable `right` to 0. The previous value of `right` was the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. Now, with this assignment, `right` is reset to 0. The other variables (`N`, `i`, `m`, `left`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `2`, `right` is 0, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `0` to `i - 1`, `j` is `i - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `2`, `right` is 0, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `0` to `i - 1`, `j` is `i - 1.**
