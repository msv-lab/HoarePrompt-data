The value of `left` is incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0 and `i` is 2, so we will calculate `abs(diff[0] - diff[2])` and add that to the previous value of `left`. The value of `left` is updated, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is 2, `left` is updated, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is 2, `left` is updated, `j` is 0**
