The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Since `j` is 0, the expression becomes `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`. The previous values of the affected variables are `left`, `diff[j]`, and `diff[i]`. The value of `right` is not directly affected by this operation, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences calculated from `A` with respect to `N + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is incremented by `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences for the index `i` if applicable, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0.**
