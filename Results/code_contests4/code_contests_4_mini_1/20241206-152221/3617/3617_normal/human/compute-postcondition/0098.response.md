According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, and since `N` is greater than `i + 1`, this means the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, resulting in `j` being `i + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is `i + 2`, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
