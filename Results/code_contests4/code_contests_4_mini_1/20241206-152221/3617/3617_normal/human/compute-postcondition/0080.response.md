According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. The loop starts with `j` at `i + 1` and continues until it reaches `N`. Given that `N` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `i + 2`. Therefore, `N` must be greater than `i + 2` for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is a positive integer, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `right` is `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`, `j` is `i + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 2**
