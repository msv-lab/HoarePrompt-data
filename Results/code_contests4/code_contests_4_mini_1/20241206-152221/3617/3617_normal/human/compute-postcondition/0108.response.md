According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range specified in the loop. The loop is set to iterate from `0` to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `i` is a positive integer + 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 2, which would allow `j` to take the value of 1 in the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows: `j` will increase by 1, so it will be 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be at least 2 (as `j` will iterate over the range of 0 to `i - 1`).

State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is now a positive integer + 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be at least 2.**
