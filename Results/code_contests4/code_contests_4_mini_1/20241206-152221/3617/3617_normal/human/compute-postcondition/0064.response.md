`N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, where `line` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer. Therefore, `N` will now hold this positive integer value. The state of `m` and the minimum value printed from `m` are not affected by this assignment. The output state reflects the change in `N`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer; `m` contains `N` values; the minimum value from `m` is printed; `line` is a non-empty string.**
