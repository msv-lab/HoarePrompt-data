According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, and `N` is greater than `i + 1`, which means for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `i + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is greater than `i + 2; `i` is a positive integer + 1; `j` is `i + 2; `left` is the sum of the absolute differences for `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1; `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it; `right` is now updated by absolute differences.**
