Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`; `line` is not empty; `diff` is the sorted list of differences; `i` is 3; `left` is updated to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) + abs(diff[j] - diff[i]); `right` is the total of absolute differences calculated from `diff[j]` for all `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1`; `j` is 2.**
