The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for each `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. Given that `left` was initially 0, its new value will depend on the specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. However, since these values are not specified, we can only state that `left` is increased by the total of those absolute differences. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is now a positive integer + 1, `j` is 0, `right` is the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1; m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it; `left` is increased by the sum of the absolute differences.

Output State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is now a positive integer + 1, `j` is 0, `right` is the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1; m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it; `left` is increased by the sum of the absolute differences.**
