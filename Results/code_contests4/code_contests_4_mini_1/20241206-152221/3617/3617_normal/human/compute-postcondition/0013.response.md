The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` must be 2 for the loop to execute a second time and `i` is at least 2, the values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are determined by their respective indices. However, the specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not provided. The previous value of `left` is also not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `left` is increased by `abs(diff[2] - diff[i])`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `left` is increased by `abs(diff[2] - diff[i])**
