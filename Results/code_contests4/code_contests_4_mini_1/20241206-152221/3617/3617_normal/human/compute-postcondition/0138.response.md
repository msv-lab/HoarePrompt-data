Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences calculated from `A` with respect to `N + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences calculated as `sum(abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for j in range(0, i))`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences for the index `i` if applicable.**
