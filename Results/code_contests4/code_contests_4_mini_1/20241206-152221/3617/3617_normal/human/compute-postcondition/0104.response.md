According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a positive integer + 1, and `N` is greater than `i`, which allows the loop to execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 and it must be less than `N`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a positive integer + 1, so for the next iteration, `i` will be the next positive integer (let's denote it as `i + 1`). 

State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is now a positive integer + 1, `j` is at least `N`, `right` is the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1; m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it.**
