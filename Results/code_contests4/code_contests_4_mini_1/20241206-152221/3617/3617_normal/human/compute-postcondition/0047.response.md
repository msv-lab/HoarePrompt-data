The variable `left` is incremented by the value of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. The current value of `j` is `1`, and `i` is at least `2`, which means that `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are both defined. The other variables (`N`, `right`, `m`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `2`, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `i + 1` to `N - 1`, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is updated by adding `abs(diff[1] - diff[i])`, `j` is 1.
