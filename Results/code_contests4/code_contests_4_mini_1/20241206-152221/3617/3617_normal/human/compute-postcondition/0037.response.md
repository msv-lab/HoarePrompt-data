The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous value of `right` is `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, and the new value of `right` will be `abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, which results in `2 * abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `1`, `right` is now `2 * abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `m` now contains the value of left + 0, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, `j` is `i + 2` for the next iteration, and `j` must be less than `N`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `1`, `right` is now `2 * abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `m` now contains the value of left + 0, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, `j` is `i + 2` for the loop to execute a second time, and `j` must be less than `N`.**
