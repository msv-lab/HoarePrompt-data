According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is a positive integer + 1, meaning `i` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be greater than 2**
