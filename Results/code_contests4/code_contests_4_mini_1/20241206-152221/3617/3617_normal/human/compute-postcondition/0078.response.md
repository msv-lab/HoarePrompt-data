According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `N`. The loop starts with `j` taking values from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i + 1 < N` must hold true. 

Given that `i` is a positive integer and `N` is a positive integer, we conclude that if `i` is at least `1`, then `i + 1` will be at least `2`. Therefore, `N` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute. 

Before the loop starts, the values of `i`, `N`, and `j` need to be set accordingly. The value of `j` should be initialized to `i + 1`, which is the starting point of the loop, and `N` must be greater than `i + 1` to ensure execution.

State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is a positive integer, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `right` is 0, `j` is `i + 1`**
