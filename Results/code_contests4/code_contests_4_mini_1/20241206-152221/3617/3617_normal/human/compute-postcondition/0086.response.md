According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a positive integer and `N` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, we must increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1`, for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than `i` + 1.**
