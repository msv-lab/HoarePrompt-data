Output State: **`m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is a positive integer, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `right` is updated by adding `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` where `j` is `i + 3`.**
