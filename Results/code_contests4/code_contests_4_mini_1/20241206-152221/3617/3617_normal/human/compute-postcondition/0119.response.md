The statement `right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` updates the value of `right` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is greater than `i + 3`
- `i` is a positive integer + 1
- `j` is `i + 3`
- `left` is the sum of the absolute differences for `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1`
- `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it
- `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`

The specific values for `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not provided, but `j` is defined as `i + 3`. Therefore, after executing the code, `right` will be increased by the absolute difference between `diff[i + 3]` and `diff[i]`.

Since the values of variables are not affected aside from `right`, we can conclude that:

Output State: **`N` is greater than `i + 3; `i` is a positive integer + 1; `j` is `i + 3; `left` is the sum of the absolute differences for `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1; `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it; `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
