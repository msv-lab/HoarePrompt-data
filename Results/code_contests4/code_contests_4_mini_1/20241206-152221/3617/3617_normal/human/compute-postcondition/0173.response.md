The statement `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` updates the value of `left` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The current value of `i` is 3, so we need to confirm the value of `j` to ensure the operation is valid; `j` must also be 3 for the loop to execute a fourth time. 

Given that `j` is 3, we can calculate the new value of `left`. The other variable `right` remains unchanged. The initial state indicates that `m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, but since we don't have the specific values for `left`, `right`, and the contents of `diff`, we only know their relationships.

Therefore, after executing the code, the value of `left` is updated, while `right` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 3, `N` is at least 4, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[3] - diff[3])` (which is `left`), `right` remains unchanged, and `j` is 3.**
