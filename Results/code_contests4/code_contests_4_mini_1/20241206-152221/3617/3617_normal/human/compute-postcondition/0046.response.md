According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `i` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `i - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.

State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `2`, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `i + 1` to `N - 1`, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[i])`, `j` is 1**
