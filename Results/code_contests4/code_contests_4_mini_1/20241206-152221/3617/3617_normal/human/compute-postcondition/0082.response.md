According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than `i + 2. 

For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `i + 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `i + 3.

State: **`m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is a positive integer, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `right` is updated by adding `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `j` is `i + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 3.**
