The code initializes `left` to `0`. This means that the previous value of `left`, which is the sum of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for all `j` from `0` to `i - 1`, is now explicitly set to `0`. The values of `N`, `i`, `right`, and `m` remain unchanged since only `left` is updated.

Output State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `2`, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `i + 1` to `N - 1`, `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is 0.**
