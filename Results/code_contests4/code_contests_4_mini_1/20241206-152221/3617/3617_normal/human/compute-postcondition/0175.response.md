The value of `right` is assigned to 0. The previous value of `right` is unchanged, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 3, `left` is updated to the sum of `left` and the absolute differences from the first three elements of `diff` to `diff[3]`, `right` is now 0, and `N` is the length of `diff` which is at least 4.
