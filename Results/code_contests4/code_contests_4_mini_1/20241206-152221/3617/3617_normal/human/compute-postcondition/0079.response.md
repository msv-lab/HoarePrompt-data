The code updates the value of `right` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous value of `right` is 0, and since `j` is `i + 1`, it will access `diff[i + 1]`. Therefore, `right` becomes `0 + abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is a positive integer, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `right` is `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`, `j` is `i + 1`**
