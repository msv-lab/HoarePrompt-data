According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `N`, meaning there must be at least one valid index for `j` to iterate through. Since `N` is given to be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `i` is within the appropriate bounds.

At the start of the loop, `i` must be less than `N - 1` for `j` to take on valid values. Given that `i` is at least 0, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is less than `N - 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be such that `i < N - 1`. If `i` is at least `N - 1`, the loop will not execute.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` must be less than `N - 1, j` is `i + 1`**
