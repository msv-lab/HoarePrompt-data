According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Specifically, the loop will iterate from 0 to `i - 1`. Since `i` is currently set to 0, the range for `j` will be empty, meaning the loop will not execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 0. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `i` needs to be adjusted to at least 1, while `N` can remain greater than 0 and `left` can remain 0. 

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1, `left` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` will iterate from 0 to `i - 1`**
