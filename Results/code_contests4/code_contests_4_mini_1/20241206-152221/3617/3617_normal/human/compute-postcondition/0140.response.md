According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop is set to iterate from `j = i + 1` to `j < N`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `j` should be at least `i + 1` and less than `N`. Therefore, it must hold that `i + 1 < N`. 

Considering the current state, we have:
- `N` is greater than 0,
- `i` is at least 1.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to confirm `N` is greater than `i + 1`. Thus, we can adjust the states as follows:
- `j` should start at `i + 1`, which would be at least 2 if `i` is at least 1,
- `N` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Hence, for the loop to execute, it needs to be ensured that `N` is at least 3 (if `i` is at least 1).

State: **`N` is greater than 2, `m` is an empty list, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences calculated from `A` with respect to `N + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `left` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences, `right` is 0, `j` is `i + 1` (at least 2)**
