The variable `right` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the variables `N`, `i`, and `left` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables alongside the new value of `right`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 0, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1; `right` is 0**
