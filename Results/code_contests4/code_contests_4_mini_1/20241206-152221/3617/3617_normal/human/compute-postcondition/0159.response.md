Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`; `line` is not empty; `diff` is the sorted list of differences; `i` is 2; `left` is the sum of absolute differences calculated from `diff[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`; `right` is the previous value of `right` incremented by `abs(diff[3] - diff[2])`; for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 3; `j` is 3.**
