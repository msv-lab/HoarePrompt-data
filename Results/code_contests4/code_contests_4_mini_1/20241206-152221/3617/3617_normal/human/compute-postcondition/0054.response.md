According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `N`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `3`, `i` is at least `2`, and `N` is greater than `2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the current value of `j` is at least `3`, it will need to be at least `4` for the loop to run again. Additionally, `N` must be greater than `4` to ensure that there is still an iteration possible.

State: **`N` is greater than `4`, `i` is at least `2`, `j` is at least `4`, `right` is updated by adding abs(diff[i - 1] - diff[i]), `m` now contains the value of `left + 0`, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from `0` to `i - 1`**
