The value of `left` is assigned 0, which means it is being reset to 0. Since `left` was previously defined as the sum of absolute differences calculated from the `diff` list, setting it to 0 means that the previous calculation for `left` is discarded. The other variables `m`, `line`, `diff`, `i`, `right`, and `N` are not affected by this change. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 3, `left` is 0, `right` remains unchanged, and `N` is the length of the `diff` list.

Output State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 3, `left` is 0, `right` remains unchanged, and `N` is the length of the `diff` list.**
