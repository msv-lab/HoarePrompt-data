According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `N`. Since `N` is greater than `0`, and `j` is currently `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is at least `i + 2` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, after the iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `1`, `right` is now `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `m` now contains the value of left + 0, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, `j` is `i + 2` for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `N`.**
