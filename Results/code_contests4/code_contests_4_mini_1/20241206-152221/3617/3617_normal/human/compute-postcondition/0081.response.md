In this case, `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The variables `diff`, `i`, and `j` are already defined, but the specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the value of `right` without specifying its exact new value.

Output State: **`m` is an empty list, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is a positive integer, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `right` is updated by adding `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `j` is `i + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 2.**
