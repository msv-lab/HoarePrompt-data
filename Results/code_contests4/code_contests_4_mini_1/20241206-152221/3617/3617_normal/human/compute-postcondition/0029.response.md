The code `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` increments the value of `left` by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The variable `left` was previously calculated as the sum of `abs(diff[0] - diff[i - 1])`. The value of `j` ranges from some valid index that satisfies the conditions of the code, and `i` is at least 1. Thus, `left` is updated based on the new value of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.

However, since the exact values of `diff`, `i`, and `j` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numeric value of `left` after this operation, but we can state that `left` has been increased by the absolute difference of the specified indices.

The output state reflects this change, so we state that `left` has been updated without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from i + 1 to N - 1 if i < N - 1; otherwise `right` is 0, `m` now contains the value of left + right, `left` has been incremented by abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**.
