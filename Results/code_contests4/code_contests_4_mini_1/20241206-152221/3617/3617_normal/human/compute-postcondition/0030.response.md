According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, which means `j` can take values from 0 up to `i - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. If `i` is currently 1, `j` will take the value 0 during the next execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to at least 2. 

Thus, the values of `N`, `right`, `m`, and `left` remain unchanged since they do not directly affect the ability to execute the loop again. 

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from i + 1 to N - 1 if i < N - 1; otherwise `right` is 0, `m` now contains the value of left + right, `left` remains unchanged and has been incremented by abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
