Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is a non-empty string, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is a positive integer + 1, `left` is 0, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1, and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than `i` + 1.**
