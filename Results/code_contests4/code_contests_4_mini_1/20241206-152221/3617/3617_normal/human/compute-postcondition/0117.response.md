Output State: **`N` is greater than `i + 2; `i` is a positive integer + 1; `j` is `i + 2; `left` is the sum of the absolute differences for `j` in the range from `0` to `i - 1; `m` includes the value `left + right` appended to it; `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
