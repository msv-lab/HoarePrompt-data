According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2` and `N` is greater than `0`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `N`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `j` equal to `i + 3`. Additionally, `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`N` is greater than `0`, `i` is at least `1`, `right` is now `2 * abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `m` now contains the value of left + 0, `left` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from 0 to i - 1, `j` is `i + 3` for the loop to execute a third time, and `j` must be less than `N`.**
