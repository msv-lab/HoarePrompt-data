According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `j` and `N`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to 3 (which is `i + 1`), and it will continue as long as `j` is less than `N`. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than the current value of `j`, which is 3. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 4, and `j` will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.

State: **`m` is a list containing the value of `left + right`, `line` is not empty, `diff` is the sorted list of differences, `i` is 2, `left` is the sum of absolute differences calculated from `diff[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`, `right` is the previous value of `right` incremented by `abs(diff[3] - diff[2])`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 4, `j` is 4.**
