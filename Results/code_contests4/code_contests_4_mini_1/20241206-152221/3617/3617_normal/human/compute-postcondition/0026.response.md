According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0 because the range starts from 0 and goes up to (but does not include) `i`. Given that `i` is at least 1 before the loop starts, the loop can execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `j` iterates from `0` to `i-1`, when the loop starts `j` will be `0` on the first iteration. The value of `left` is `0` before the loop starts and does not influence the execution of the loop itself. 

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1, `right` is the sum of abs(diff[j] - diff[i]) for all j from i + 1 to N - 1 if i < N - 1; otherwise `right` is 0, `m` now contains the value of left + right, `left` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
