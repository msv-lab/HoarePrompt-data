The function accepts a positive integer N and a list of integers A of length N. It calculates the sum of absolute differences between the sorted values of A adjusted by their indices, for each index in A. It then prints the minimum of these sums for each line of input until no more lines are available. If multiple lines are provided, the function processes each line separately and computes the respective results.
