To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it against the problem description and provided examples.

### Problem Requirements:
The task is to find the minimum possible sadness defined by the formula:
```
abs(A_1 - (b+1)) + abs(A_2 - (b+2)) + ... + abs(A_N - (b+N))
```
The input consists of an integer `N` followed by a list of integers `A` of length `N`. The output should be the minimum possible sadness.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(argv):
    line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
    while line:
        N = int(line)
        A = [int(a) for a in raw_input().rstrip('\n').split(' ')]
        diff = sorted([a - (i + 1) for (i, a) in enumerate(A)])
        m = []
        for i in range(N):
            left = 0
            for j in range(0, i):
                left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])
            right = 0
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])
            m.append(left + right)
        print(min(m))
        line = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1(sys.argv)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads `N` and then reads the next line as a space-separated list of integers. The first line is correctly read, but the second line uses `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3, and should be replaced with `input()`.

2. **Calculating Differences**:
   - The variable `diff` computes the difference between each element of `A` and its respective index (adjusted for 1-based indexing). This is correctly done.

3. **Calculating Sadness**:
   - The program calculates the sadness for each index `i` based on the absolute differences from the sorted `diff` array. 
   - However, it calculates sadness for each index separately and sums it up. This approach will not yield the correct minimum sadness since it does not consider the optimal value of `b` effectively across the whole list.

### Potential Failure Case:
A simple counterexample can highlight the failure:
- For `N = 3` and `A = [1, 3, 5]`, the optimal `b` should be `1` resulting in minimum sadness of `0`. However, the program will calculate incorrect values as it does not correctly iterate through all potential values of `b` to find the one that minimizes the total sadness.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum sadness as required by the problem description, and it also contains an input handling error that would cause it to fail in execution.

Correctness: **False**.
