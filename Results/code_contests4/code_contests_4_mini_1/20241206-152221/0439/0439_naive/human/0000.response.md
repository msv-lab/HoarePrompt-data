To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. There must be at least one south magnet in every row and every column.
2. If a cell is colored black (`#`), then it must be possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations.
3. If a cell is colored white (`.`), then it must be impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The function `func_2()` reads the grid and checks if it contains only white cells. If it does, it correctly returns `0`, as no north magnets are needed.
2. It then checks each row for the presence of black cells (`#`). It finds the first and last occurrence of `#` (if any) and checks that there are no white cells (`.`) in between. If there are white cells in the range of black cells, it immediately returns `-1`, indicating an impossible configuration.
3. It transposes the grid to perform the same checks on columns.
4. Finally, it counts connected components of black cells using `func_1()`, which performs a depth-first search (DFS). The count of these components is returned as the minimum number of north magnets required.

### Potential Issues:
- The program correctly identifies situations where it is impossible to place the magnets according to the rules.
- However, there is a potential oversight in how north magnets are counted. The logic for connected components assumes that each connected black cell can be covered by a single north magnet, which might not hold true in all cases, especially in complex configurations of black and white cells.
- Additionally, it does not handle cases where a row or column might have multiple isolated black cells correctly in terms of determining the minimum number of north magnets needed.

### Test Case to Illustrate Failure:
Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
#..
.#.
..#
```
- In this grid, there are isolated black cells and the program might incorrectly return a count of 2 or more, while it might actually need only 1 north magnet to cover all black cells.

Thus, there exists a scenario where the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of north magnets required due to the way it counts components without considering isolated placements that might still fulfill the row/column requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and potential edge cases where the program does not function as intended, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
