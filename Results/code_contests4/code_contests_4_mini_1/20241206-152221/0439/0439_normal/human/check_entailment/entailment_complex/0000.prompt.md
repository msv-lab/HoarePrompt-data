You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monopole magnet is a magnet that only has one pole, either north or south. They don't actually exist since real magnets have two poles, but this is a programming contest problem, so we don't care.

There is an n× m grid. Initially, you may place some north magnets and some south magnets into the cells. You are allowed to place as many magnets as you like, even multiple in the same cell.

An operation is performed as follows. Choose a north magnet and a south magnet to activate. If they are in the same row or the same column and they occupy different cells, then the north magnet moves one unit closer to the south magnet. Otherwise, if they occupy the same cell or do not share a row or column, then nothing changes. Note that the south magnets are immovable.

Each cell of the grid is colored black or white. Let's consider ways to place magnets in the cells so that the following conditions are met.

  1. There is at least one south magnet in every row and every column. 
  2. If a cell is colored black, then it is possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 
  3. If a cell is colored white, then it is impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 



Determine if it is possible to place magnets such that these conditions are met. If it is possible, find the minimum number of north magnets required (there are no requirements on the number of south magnets).

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.

The next n lines describe the coloring. The i-th of these lines contains a string of length m, where the j-th character denotes the color of the cell in row i and column j. The characters "#" and "." represent black and white, respectively. It is guaranteed, that the string will not contain any other characters.

Output

Output a single integer, the minimum possible number of north magnets required.

If there is no placement of magnets that satisfies all conditions, print a single integer -1.

Note

In the first test, here is an example placement of magnets:

<image>

In the second test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are three example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 3 since we can move the north magnet down onto a white square. The second example violates rule 2 since we cannot move the north magnet to the bottom-left black square by any sequence of operations. The third example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first column.

<image>

In the third test, here is an example placement of magnets. We can show that there is no required placement of magnets with fewer north magnets.

<image>

In the fourth test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are two example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first row. The second example violates rules 1 and 3 since there is no south magnet in the second row and we can move the north magnet up one unit onto a white square.

<image>

In the fifth test, we can put the south magnet in each cell and no north magnets. Because there are no black cells, it will be a correct placement.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and grid is a list of strings where each string has a length of m consisting of characters '#' and '.' representing black and white cells respectively.
def func_1(n, m, grid):
    components, visited = 0, [([False] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not visited[i][j] and grid[i][j] == '#':
                components += dfs(i, j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `components` is the total number of connected components in the grid, `visited` reflects the explored positions in the grid, `grid` is an n by m grid containing '#' and other characters.
    return components
    #The program returns the total number of connected components in the grid
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `grid`, where each string represents a row of cells with '#' for black cells and '.' for white cells. It returns the total number of connected components of '#' cells in the grid. If there are no '#' cells, it will return 0, indicating no components are found.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each of length m, consisting of characters '#' (black) and '.' (white).
def get_adj(i, j):
    adj = [(i + 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i - 1, j), (i, j - 1)]
    res = []
    for (ai, aj) in adj:
        if 0 <= ai < n and 0 <= aj < m and grid[ai][aj] == '#':
            res.append((ai, aj))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a list containing all tuples `(ai, aj)` from `adj` where `0 <= ai < n`, `0 <= aj < m`, and `grid[ai][aj] == '#'`; `adj` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of adjacent cells in a grid.
    return res
    #The program returns the list of tuples `res` containing all coordinates `(ai, aj)` from `adj` where `0 <= ai < n`, `0 <= aj < m`, and `grid[ai][aj] == '#'`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, representing the coordinates of a cell in a grid. It returns a list of tuples containing the coordinates of all adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right) that are within the grid boundaries and contain a black cell ('#'). If none of the adjacent cells are black or if the coordinates are at the edges of the grid, the function will return an empty list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each of length m, consisting of characters '#' (black) and '.' (white).
def dfs(i, j):
    component, stack = 1, [(i, j)]
    while stack:
        si, sj = stack[-1]
        
        if visited[si][sj]:
            stack.pop()
            continue
        else:
            visited[si][sj] = True
            component = 1
            for ai, aj in get_adj(si, sj):
                if not visited[ai][aj]:
                    stack.append((ai, aj))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `stack` is empty, `component` is 1, all positions in `visited` that were reachable from the initial position have been marked as True.
    return component
    #The program returns the value of component which is 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, representing coordinates in a grid of characters ('#' for black and '.' for white). It performs a depth-first search to explore connected components from the starting position `(i, j)`. However, instead of returning the size of the connected component as might be expected, it always returns the value 1, indicating that at least one cell (the starting position) was visited, regardless of the actual size of the component. This implies that the function does not accurately reflect the number of cells connected to the starting cell.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the grid is represented by a list of n strings, each of length m, containing only characters '#' (black) and '.' (white).
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    if (grid == [('.' * m) for _ in range(n)]) :
        func_3(0)
        return
        #The program returns None, as there is no value specified in the return statement.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `grid` is a list of `n` strings from input. The `grid` is not equal to a list of `n` strings where each string consists of `m` dots ('.').
    for row in grid:
        start, stop = row.find('#'), row.rfind('#')
        
        if start == -1 or '.' in row[start:stop + 1]:
            func_3(-1)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `grid` is a list of `n` strings; for each `row`, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#', `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in `row`, and there are no '.' characters in the substring of `row` from index `start` to index `stop` for any row.
    grit = transpose(grid)
    for row in grit:
        start, stop = row.find('#'), row.rfind('#')
        
        if start == -1 or '.' in row[start:stop + 1]:
            func_3(-1)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `grit` is a list of strings that have been transposed from `grid`; for every `row` in `grit`, if `row` contains at least one occurrence of '#' and there are no '.' characters between the first and last occurrence of '#', the loop completes without returning. If any `row` does not meet these conditions, the function returns None immediately.
    func_3(func_1(n, m, grid))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and verifies the structure of a grid represented by a list of strings. It checks if the grid consists entirely of '.' characters, and if so, it calls `func_3(0)` and returns None. It then ensures that each row contains '#' characters without any '.' between the first and last occurrence of '#'. If any row fails this check, it calls `func_3(-1)` and returns None. After validating rows, it transposes the grid and performs the same checks on the transposed version. Finally, it calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1(n, m, grid)`. The function returns None in all cases, as there are no return values specified in the code.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000; the next n lines contain strings of length m, where each string consists of characters '#' (representing black cells) and '.' (representing white cells).
def func_3():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and all elements from `args` have been written to `file`, separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the end value from kwargs has been written to file, defaulting to '\n' if not provided. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` evaluates to True, then `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable number of arguments and keyword arguments. It writes these arguments to a specified output file, separated by a defined separator. If no separator is provided, it defaults to a space. After writing all the arguments, it adds an optional end character (defaulting to a newline) and can flush the output file if specified. The function does not process or validate the input strings, nor does it handle edge cases such as invalid types or empty input.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
