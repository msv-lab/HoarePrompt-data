The function accepts no parameters and verifies the structure of a grid represented by a list of strings. It checks if the grid consists entirely of '.' characters, and if so, it calls `func_3(0)` and returns None. It then ensures that each row contains '#' characters without any '.' between the first and last occurrence of '#'. If any row fails this check, it calls `func_3(-1)` and returns None. After validating rows, it transposes the grid and performs the same checks on the transposed version. Finally, it calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1(n, m, grid)`. The function returns None in all cases, as there are no return values specified in the code.
