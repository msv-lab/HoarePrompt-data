The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, representing the coordinates of a cell in a grid. It returns a list of tuples containing the coordinates of all adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right) that are within the grid boundaries and contain a black cell ('#'). If none of the adjacent cells are black or if the coordinates are at the edges of the grid, the function will return an empty list.
