The function `dfs` accepts parameters `i` and `j`, which represent coordinates in a grid. The grid is defined by `n` strings, each containing characters '#' (black) and '.' (white). The function returns the value of `component`, which is always 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `dfs` is to accept grid coordinates and return a constant value of 1.
