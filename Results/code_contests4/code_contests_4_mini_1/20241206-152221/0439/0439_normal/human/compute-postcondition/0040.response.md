Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `grit` is a list of strings that have been transposed from `grid`; for every `row` in `grit`, if `row` contains at least one occurrence of '#' and there are no '.' characters between the first and last occurrence of '#', the loop completes without returning. If any `row` does not meet these conditions, the function returns None immediately.**
