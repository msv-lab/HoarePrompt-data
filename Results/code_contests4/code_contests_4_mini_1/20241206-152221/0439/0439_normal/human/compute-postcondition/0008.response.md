According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, meaning that the loop has already started, and `x` is currently the last element processed in `args`. 

To execute one more time, `args` must have more elements, and `x` should be updated to the next element in `args`. Since `n` and `m` values are not directly affecting the loop execution in this context, they remain unchanged. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute a second time `args` must have at least one more element than before.**
