Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `row` is the second string in `grit`. If there is no occurrence of '#' in `row` or if there is a '.' in the substring of `row` between the first and last occurrence of '#', the program returns None. Otherwise, there is no specified return value in the else part.***
