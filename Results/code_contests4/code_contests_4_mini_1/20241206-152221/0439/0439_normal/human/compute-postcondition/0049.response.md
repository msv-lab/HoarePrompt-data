According to the code, the loop iterates over the adjacent positions returned by the `get_adj(si, sj)` function. At the end of the last iteration, `si` and `sj` were the coordinates from which adjacent positions were retrieved, and at least one position (ai, aj) was found. Since `visited[ai][aj]` was checked to be False and was set to True, we can assume that (ai, aj) has already been processed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `get_adj(si, sj)` still returns at least one more adjacent position that has not yet been visited. This means we need to check if there are unvisited adjacent positions left.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `component` remains 1, `si` and `sj` are unchanged, and `visited` must allow for at least one more position from the adjacent positions returned by `get_adj(si, sj)` to be unvisited.

State: **`component` is 1, `si` and `sj` are unchanged, for the loop to execute again `visited` must have at least one unvisited adjacent position from `get_adj(si, sj)`**
