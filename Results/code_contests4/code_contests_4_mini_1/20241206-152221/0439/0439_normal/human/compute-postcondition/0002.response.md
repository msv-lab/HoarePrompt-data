According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `args`. For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must have at least one element. The states `n`, `m`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

To ensure the loop executes for the first time, `args` should be a non-empty iterable. Additionally, since `x` will take on the values in `args`, there is no specific initial value for `x` before the loop starts, as it will be assigned the first element of `args` on the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable**
