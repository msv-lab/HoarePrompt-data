The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, which changes its state from `True` to `False`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False**.
