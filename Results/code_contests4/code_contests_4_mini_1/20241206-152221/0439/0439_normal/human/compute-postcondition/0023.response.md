The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it is implied that the function operates on input that consists of integers `n` and `m`, where both are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\). Following this, the function processes `n` lines, each containing strings of length `m`, where each string consists of characters '#' (representing black cells) and '.' (representing white cells).

The function likely returns a result based on the analysis or manipulation of these strings, but the exact output is not specified in the provided information. Thus, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly; it processes input based on integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m consisting of '#' and '.' characters, and returns a result based on this input.**
