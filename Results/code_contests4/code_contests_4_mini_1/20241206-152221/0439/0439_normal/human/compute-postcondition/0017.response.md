The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which was already its initial state. Therefore, there are no changes to the values of any variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and a string representation of `x` has been written to the output file.**
