Postcondition: ***`component` is 1, `si` and `sj` are assigned from the last tuple in `stack`, `visited[si][sj]` is True, and `get_adj(si, sj)` returns at least one adjacent position (ai, aj). If `visited[ai][aj]` is False, then `visited[ai][aj]` is set to True and (ai, aj) is appended to `stack`.***
