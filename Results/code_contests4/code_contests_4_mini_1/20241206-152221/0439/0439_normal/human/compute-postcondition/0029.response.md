Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `row` is the first string in `grit`; `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#' in `row`; `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in `row`. The variable `start` is not equal to -1, and there are no '.' characters in the substring of `row` from index `start` to index `stop`.***
