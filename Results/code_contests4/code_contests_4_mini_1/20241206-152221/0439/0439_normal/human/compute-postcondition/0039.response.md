Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `row` is the third string in `grit` if `grit` has at least three strings; `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#', `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in `row`. If `start` is -1 or there is a '.' in the substring of `row` from `start` to `stop`, the function returns None.***
