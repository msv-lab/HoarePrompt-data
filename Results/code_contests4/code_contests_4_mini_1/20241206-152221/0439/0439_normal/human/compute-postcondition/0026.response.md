Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `row` is the first string in `grit`; `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#' in `row`; `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in `row`. Either `start` is -1 or there is at least one '.' in the substring of `row` from `start` to `stop` inclusive.***
