According to the code, the loop will execute again for the next string in `grit`. The loop iterates over each `row` in the `grit` list. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is the second string in `grit`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must be updated to the next string in the list.

If there are at least three strings in `grit`, then `row` will become the third string. If there are only two strings, the loop will terminate, as there will be no more strings to iterate over. Therefore, we must note that `row` will be the third string if it exists.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `row` is the third string in `grit` if `grit` has at least three strings.**
