According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the output of the `get_adj(si, sj)` function. This function provides the adjacent coordinates `(ai, aj)` based on the current states of `si` and `sj`. At the end of the last iteration, `component` is 1, and `si` and `sj` are unchanged. If `visited[ai][aj]` is False, then `(ai, aj)` is added to `stack`. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged when `visited[ai][aj]` is True.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need a new pair `(ai, aj)` from `get_adj(si, sj)` that has not been visited yet. This means the `visited` array must show that at least one new adjacent coordinate is unvisited. If the loop is to execute again, `component` remains 1, but we will have a new pair `(ai, aj)` and `visited[ai][aj]` must be False.

State: **`component` is 1, `si` and `sj` are unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `visited[ai][aj]` must be False for a new adjacent coordinate `(ai, aj)`.**
