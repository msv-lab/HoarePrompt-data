According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `grit` list. If the `grit` list has more rows after the current one, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is the first string in `grit`, and for the loop to execute again, `row` must be the next string in the `grit` list. Therefore, if the loop has processed the first string, it must now process the second string, and the index of that string should be updated accordingly. 

If the `grit` list has at least 2 strings, the next `row` will be the second string in `grit`. 

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1000; `row` is the second string in `grit`, for the loop to execute a second time `grit` must contain at least 2 rows.**
