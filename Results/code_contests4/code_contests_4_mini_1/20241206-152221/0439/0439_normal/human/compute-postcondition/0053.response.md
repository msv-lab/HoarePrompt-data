The line of code `stack.append((ai, aj))` adds the tuple `(ai, aj)` to the `stack` list. The variable `component` remains unchanged at 1, and the values of `si` and `sj` are also unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute a second time is not affected by this operation, as we're only modifying the `stack` variable. Since the previous values of `visited[ai][aj]` must be False for the loop to continue, we do not have information on its current state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `component` is 1, `si` is unchanged, `sj` is unchanged, and `(ai, aj)` has been added to `stack`.
Output State: **`component` is 1, `si` is unchanged, `sj` is unchanged, and `(ai, aj)` has been added to `stack.**
