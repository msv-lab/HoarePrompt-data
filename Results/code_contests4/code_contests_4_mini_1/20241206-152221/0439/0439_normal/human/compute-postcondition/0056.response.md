Postcondition: ***`component` is 1, `si` and `sj` are assigned values from the last tuple in `stack` where `visited[si][sj]` is False. If `visited[si][sj]` is True, the last tuple is removed from `stack` and the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `si` and `sj` remain unchanged, `visited` marks all reachable positions from `(si, sj)` as True, and `stack` contains all adjacent positions `(ai, aj)` that were not previously visited.***
