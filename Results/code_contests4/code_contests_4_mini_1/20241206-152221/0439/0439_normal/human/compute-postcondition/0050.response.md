The code `stack.append((ai, aj))` adds the tuple `(ai, aj)` to the `stack`. The `component` is 1, and the values of `si` and `sj` remain unchanged. The state of the `visited` variable is not directly modified by this line of code; it merely indicates that an adjacent position `(ai, aj)` has been added to the `stack` for potential future processing. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `component`, `si`, and `sj`, and mention the addition of `(ai, aj)` to `stack`.

Output State: **`component` is 1, `si` and `sj` are unchanged, and `(ai, aj)` is added to `stack`.**
