The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `grid`, where each string represents a row of cells with '#' for black cells and '.' for white cells. It returns the total number of connected components of '#' cells in the grid. If there are no '#' cells, it will return 0, indicating no components are found.
