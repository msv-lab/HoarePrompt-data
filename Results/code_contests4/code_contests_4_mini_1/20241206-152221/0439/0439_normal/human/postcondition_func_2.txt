The function `dfs` accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, representing coordinates in a grid of characters ('#' for black and '.' for white). It performs a depth-first search to explore connected components from the starting position `(i, j)`. However, instead of returning the size of the connected component as might be expected, it always returns the value 1, indicating that at least one cell (the starting position) was visited, regardless of the actual size of the component. This implies that the function does not accurately reflect the number of cells connected to the starting cell.
