Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw in the calculation of BMI. The BMI formula is defined as:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2} \]

The program incorrectly uses the formula as:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}}^2 \]

This mistake leads to an inaccurate BMI calculation. For example, if we take a student with a weight of 70.0 kg and a height of 1.80 m, the correct BMI should be:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{70.0}{1.80^2} \approx 21.60 \]

However, using the faulty implementation from the code:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{70.0}{1.80}^2 \approx 21.60^2 = 466.56 \]

This would incorrectly classify the student as obese when they are not.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify students with a BMI of 25 or higher, leading to incorrect outputs.
