Output State: **`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from input for each student, and the student ID (`number`) is printed for all students whose BMI (calculated as `weight` divided by the square of `height`) is greater than or equal to 25.0. If no students meet this criterion, no output is produced.**
