The variables `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the next line of input, which is expected to be a single line containing three values separated by commas. The previous values of these variables are unknown until the input is provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that these variables will hold the values from the input line.

Output State: **`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the next line of input, split by commas.**
