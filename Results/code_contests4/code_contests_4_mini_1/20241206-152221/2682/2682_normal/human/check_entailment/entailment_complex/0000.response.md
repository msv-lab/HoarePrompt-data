Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) according to the standard formula provided in the problem description. The formula for BMI is:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2} \]

However, the program mistakenly uses the expression `float(weight) / float(height) ** 2` directly without ensuring that the height is measured in meters. The problem description implies that height should be taken as a value between 1.0 and 2.0 meters, hence no conversion is made, which is acceptable in this case. 

The main issue lies in the handling of the input and output. The program reads from `stdin` (standard input) and splits the input by commas. The output format specified in the problem description is to print student IDs on a single line, but the program prints each ID on a new line. Therefore, it fails to meet the output requirements of the problem description.

Additionally, there is no handling for edge cases, such as when no students meet the BMI criterion, which is consistent with the program's current logic but is not explicitly addressed in the problem description.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description, particularly in its output formatting.
