The function processes input lines containing student IDs, weights, and heights, calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each student, and prints the student ID for those whose BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0. If no students meet this criterion, there will be no output. The function does not return any values or accept parameters directly.
