The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned based on the input received from `raw_input()`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts the split input strings into integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` as integers based on the provided input. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on the input received from raw_input()**
