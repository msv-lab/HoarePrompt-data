According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `k`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Since the loop starts at `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be increased to 2. Also, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2 (since `j` must be less than or equal to `k`).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `nn[1]` is now 0**
