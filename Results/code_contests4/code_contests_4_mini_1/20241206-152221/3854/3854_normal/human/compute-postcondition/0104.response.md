The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. Since `j` is 3 and `i` is 1, the value of `d` will now be determined by the value at the index `ins[3][1]`. The previous value of `d` was assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`, but that does not affect the assignment of `d` in this line. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]**
