Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][2]`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is True, then `core[j]` remains 3. If `cell[d]` is False, and `nn[d]` is not 0, then `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` remains 3, and `core[nn[d]]` is also 3, with `nn[d]` being 3. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3.***
