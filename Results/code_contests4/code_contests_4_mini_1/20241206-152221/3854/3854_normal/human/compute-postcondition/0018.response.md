The line `nn[j] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the index `j` of the list `nn`. Given the initial state where `j` is 3, this means that the fourth element of the list `nn` (since indexing starts at 0) is set to 0. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `k`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that the fourth element of the list `nn` is now 0, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `nn[3]` is 0**
