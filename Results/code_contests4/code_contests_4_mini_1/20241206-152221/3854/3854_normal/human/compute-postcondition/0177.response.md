Functionality: ** The function reads integers from input to form a list of instructions for `n` cores, where each core may be assigned a task based on the instructions. It processes `n` lines of `m` integers within the range of `0` to `k`, determining the assignment of tasks to the cores, storing the results in a list, and then prints the assignment for each core from `1` to `n`. The function does not return any value. **
