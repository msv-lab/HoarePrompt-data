The value of `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the calculation results in `core[j]` being assigned the value 0 + 1, which equals 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `j`, and `d`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][0]`, and `core[2]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][0]`, `core[2]` is 1**
