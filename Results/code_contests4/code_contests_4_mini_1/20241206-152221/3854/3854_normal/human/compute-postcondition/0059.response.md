Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is 1, `core[nn[d]]` is 1, and `nn[d]` is set to 3. If `nn[d]` equals 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3.***
