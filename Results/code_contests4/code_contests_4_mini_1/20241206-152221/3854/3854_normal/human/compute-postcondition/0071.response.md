To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the given initial state and the loop code. 

The loop iterates over a range defined by `k`. For each iteration, it assigns the value 0 to the `nn[j]` for `j` from 1 to `k`. 

1. If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute at all, meaning that no assignments to `nn[j]` occur. Therefore, `nn` remains unchanged for all values of `j`.
2. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute `k` times, assigning `nn[j]` to 0 for each `j` from 1 to `k`.

After evaluating these conditions, we can summarize the output state:

- If `k` is 0: `nn` remains unchanged (the values for `j` in `nn` do not change).
- If `k` is greater than 0: `nn[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `k` will be 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` will be `k + 1`, and `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`.**
