Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is between 1 and `n`, `core[j]` is either 3 or remains 2 for each `j` where `core[j]` was initially 0, `cell[d]` is True for certain indices `d` that were updated during the loop, `nn[d]` is updated to the last `j` that modified it, and remains 0 for indices that were never assigned.**
