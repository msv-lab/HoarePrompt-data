According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `k`. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, and since `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` will be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is now 3, and `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0.**
