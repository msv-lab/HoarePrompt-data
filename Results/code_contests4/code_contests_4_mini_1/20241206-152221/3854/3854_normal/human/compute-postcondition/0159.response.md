To analyze the provided code snippet, let's break it down step by step based on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is at least 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is at least 3
   - `j` is 3
   - `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][2]`
   - `cell[d]` is `True`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The assignment `core[j] = core[nn[d]] = i + 1` involves several operations:
     - `i + 1` calculates to `2 + 1`, which results in `3`.
     - `core[j]` is then assigned the value from `core[nn[d]]`, which implies that `core[nn[d]]` must also be assigned the same value of `3`.

3. **Impact**:
   - The value of `core[j]` will be `3` after executing the assignment.
   - The variable `core[nn[d]]` will also reflect the value `3`, but we do not have information about `nn[d]` or the value of `core` prior to this assignment.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since we do not have specific values for `core` or `nn[d]`, but we know that `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both set to `3`, the output state will focus on the known values and the assignments that have occurred.

Therefore, the final output state will reflect the known assignments without additional context on the variables that were not specified:

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned from `ins[3][2]`, `cell[d]` is True; `core[j]` is 3, `core[nn[d]]` is 3.**
