Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][2]`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[2]` is set to 3. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is false, then `nn[d]` retains its original value of 2 if it is not 0; if `nn[d]` is 0, it is assigned the value 2. If `d` equals 0, the behavior of the program is not specified.***
