To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's structure and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

1. The loop iterates `m` times (from `0` to `m-1`), where `i` represents the current iteration.
2. Inside each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop resets `nn` for indices from `1` to `k`.
3. The second inner loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n`. Based on the conditions involving `core`, `cell`, and `nn`, it updates `core[j]`, `cell[d]`, and `nn[d]`.

From the provided output states:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `core[j]` can either be `0` or `1`, depending on whether conditions were met, and `nn[d]` has been updated where applicable.
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `core[j]` is `2` for those `j` where conditions were satisfied, and the `cell[d]` is `True` for certain values of `d`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `core[j]` can be `3` or stay `2`, depending on whether conditions were met, and `nn[d]` continues to hold the last `j` index for updated `d`.

If the loop executes `m` times, the final state will depend on the conditions met during the last iteration. If `m > 0`, we can conclude:

- For all `j` from `1` to `n`, `core[j]` will be either `m` (if the conditions were satisfied during the last iteration) or will retain its last updated value.
- The `cell[d]` will be `True` for certain indices `d` that were updated during the loop executions, and `nn[d]` will contain the last `j` that modified it or remain `0` if it was never assigned.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `m - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is between `1` and `n`, `core[j]` is either `m` or a value less than `m` for each `j`, `cell[d]` is `True` for certain indices `d`, and `nn[d]` holds the last `j` index for certain valid `d`, or remains `0` if never assigned.**
