The code initializes a list `nn` with a length of `k + 1`, where each element is set to `0`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are based on the input, but they do not affect this specific operation. The list `nn` is newly created and will contain `k + 1` zeros.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `k + 1` False values; `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `k + 1` False values; `nn` is a list of `k + 1` zeros.**
