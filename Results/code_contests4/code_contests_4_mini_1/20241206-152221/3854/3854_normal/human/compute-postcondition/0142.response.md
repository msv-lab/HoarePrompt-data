Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1. If the element at index `j` of `core` is 0, then `core[j]` is updated to 3 if `cell[d]` is true and `nn[d]` is set to 1 if it was not equal to 0; otherwise, if `cell[d]` is false, `nn[d]` is updated to 1 if it was originally 0. If the element at index `j` of `core` is not 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
