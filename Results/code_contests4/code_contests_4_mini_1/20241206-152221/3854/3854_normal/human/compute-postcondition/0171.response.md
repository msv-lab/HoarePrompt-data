According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop currently starts with `i` at 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 before the next iteration starts, so `i` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
