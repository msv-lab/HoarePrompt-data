The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, which indicates that `d` holds a specific value based on the input structure `ins`. The code `cell[d] = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the index `d` of the `cell` array. This indicates that the state of the `cell` at index `d` has changed to `True`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged as the operation only affects `cell`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1] and cell[d] is set to True.**
