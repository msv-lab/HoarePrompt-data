`core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. The element at index `j` of `core` (which is `core[1]` since `j` is 1) is updated to 3. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1, the element at index `j` of `core` is 3, `d` is assigned the value from `ins[1][2]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1, the element at index `j` of `core` is 3, `d` is assigned the value from `ins[1][2]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.**
