To analyze the provided code snippet, we'll break down the operations step by step based on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is at least 3 (value not specified).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer (value not specified).
   - `j` is 3.
   - `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]` (value not specified, but we should assume it is valid).
   - `cell[d]` is set to `True` (indicating `d` is a valid index).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The statement `core[j] = core[nn[d]] = i + 1` will be evaluated:
     - `i + 1` calculates to `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Thus, `core[j]` (where `j` is 3) will be set to `2`.
     - The expression `core[nn[d]]` also needs to resolve to the same value, but since we don't have specifics about `nn[d]`, we can note that it's being used to index `core`.

3. **Variables Affected**:
   - `core[3]` is updated to `2`. 
   - Other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `j`, `d`, `cell`) remain unchanged, except that we updated `cell[d]` to `True` previously.

4. **Output State**:
   - We can summarize the results:
     - `n` is at least 3.
     - `i` is 1.
     - `k` is a non-negative integer.
     - `j` is 3.
     - `d` is assigned from `ins[3][1]`.
     - `cell[d]` is `True`.
     - `core[3]` is 2.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `k` is a non-negative integer; `j` is 3; `d` is assigned from `ins[3][1]`; `cell[d]` is True; `core[3]` is 2.**
