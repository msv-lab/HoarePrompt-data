The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`, which references a specific element in the `ins` array. The variable `j` is 3, so `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 3. This means that the value at index `d` of the `nn` array is updated to 3. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in the `nn` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned `ins[3][0]`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3.**
