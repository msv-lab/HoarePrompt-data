`core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` evaluates to 2. The variable `j` is 3, which means `core[3]` will now hold the value 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `d`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, and `core[3]` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, `core[3]` is 2**
