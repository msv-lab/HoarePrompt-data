Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][0]`. If `d` is not equal to 0, if `cell[d]` is True, then `core[2]` is set to 1. If `cell[d]` is False and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is set to 1, and `nn[d]` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2. If `d` is equal to 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
