The code creates a list of lists (2D list) called `ins`. The outer list will have `n + 1` elements, and each of these elements will be a list containing `m` zeros. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on the input received, the exact dimensions of `ins` will depend on the specific values of `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the impact of the code is that `ins` will be a list with `n + 1` sublists, each containing `m` zeros. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` do not change, but the structure of `ins` is defined based on those values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros.**
