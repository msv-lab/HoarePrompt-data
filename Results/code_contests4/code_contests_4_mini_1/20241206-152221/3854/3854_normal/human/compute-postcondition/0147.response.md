The value of `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which in turn is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 3. The previous value of `j` is 2, so `core[2]` will be assigned the value 3. The values of `n`, `k`, and `cell[d]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `cell[d]` is True, and `core[2]` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `cell[d]` is True, and `core[2]` is 3**
