Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned from `ins[2][1]`. If `core[3]` is 0, and if `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is True, then `core[3]` is set to 2. If `cell[d]` is False and `nn[d]` is not 0, then `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[3]` is set to 2, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of 3. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of 3.***
