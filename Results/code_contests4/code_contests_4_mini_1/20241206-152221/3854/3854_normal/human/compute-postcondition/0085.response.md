The variable `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. Given that `j` is 1, `nn[d]` will now be 1. The previous state of `nn[d]` was 0, and now it will be updated. The impact on other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1, `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`, `core[j]` is 0; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][1]` and `d` is not equal to 0; the value of `cell[d]` is 0, and `nn[d]` was 0 but now `nn[d]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1, `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`, `core[j]` is 0; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][1]` and `d` is not equal to 0; the value of `cell[d]` is 0, and `nn[d]` is 1.**
