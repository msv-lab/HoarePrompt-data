According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, starting from 1 and continuing up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
