According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
