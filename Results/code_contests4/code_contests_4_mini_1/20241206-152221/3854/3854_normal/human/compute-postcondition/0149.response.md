The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][2]`, which is currently unknown but represents a specific index in a 2D structure `ins`. The value of `j` is 2, so `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. The states of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 2; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][2]` and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 2; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][2]` and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2.**
