According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
