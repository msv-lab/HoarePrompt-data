The statement `cell[d] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `d` of the `cell` array. Since it's given that `cell[d]` was previously 0, it indicates that it has changed from 0 to `True`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the update in the `cell` array.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1, the element at index `j` of `core` is 0, `d` is assigned the value from `ins[1][2]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.**
