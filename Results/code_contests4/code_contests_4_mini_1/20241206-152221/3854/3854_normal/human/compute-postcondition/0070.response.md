The value of `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0, which it already holds, so there is no change in the value of `nn[j]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is now 4, and `nn[j]` is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is now 4, and `nn[j]` is still 0.**
