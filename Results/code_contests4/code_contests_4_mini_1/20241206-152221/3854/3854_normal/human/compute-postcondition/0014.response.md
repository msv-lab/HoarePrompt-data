The line `nn[j] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the index `j` of the array (or list) `nn`. The previous value of `j` is `1`, so the value at `nn[1]` will be set to `0`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `nn[1]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` is now 0**
