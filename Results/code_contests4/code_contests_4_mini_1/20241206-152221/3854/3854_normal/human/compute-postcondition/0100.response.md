Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`. If `cell[d]` is `True`, then `core[2]` is 2. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is not 0, `cell[d]` is set to `True`, `core[j]` is 2, `core[nn[d]]` is 2, and `nn[d]` is now 2. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2.***
