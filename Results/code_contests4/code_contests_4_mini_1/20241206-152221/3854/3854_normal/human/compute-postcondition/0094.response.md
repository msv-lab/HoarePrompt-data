The code assigns `True` to `cell[d]`, where `d` is the value obtained from `ins[2][1]`. The variable `cell` is affected by this assignment. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `j` do not change, and the only change occurs in the `cell` structure. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 2; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1] and `cell[d]` is set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 2; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1] and `cell[d]` is set to `True`.**
