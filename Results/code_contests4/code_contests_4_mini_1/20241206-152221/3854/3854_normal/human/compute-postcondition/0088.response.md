Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1. If `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` is updated to 2, and `cell[d]` remains true. If `cell[d]` is false, then if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[0] = 2`, `cell[d]` is true, and `nn[d]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` equals 0, `nn[d]` is updated to 1 while the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `j`, `core[j]`, and `cell[d]` remain unchanged, with `d` being assigned to `ins[1][1]` and the value of `cell[d]` being 0.***
