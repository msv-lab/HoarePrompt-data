According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 3. 

Since `n` is at least 1, to allow another iteration, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`.**
