Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned from `ins[3][1]`. If `cell[d]` is True, then `core[3]` is 2. If `cell[d]` is False, and if `nn[d]` is not 0, then `cell[d]` is True, `core[3]` is 2, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 3. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of 3.***
