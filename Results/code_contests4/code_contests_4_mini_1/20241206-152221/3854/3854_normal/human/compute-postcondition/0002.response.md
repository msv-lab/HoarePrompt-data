The variable `cell` is assigned a list that contains `k + 1` boolean values, all initialized to `False`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on the input, and the list `ins` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `k + 1` False values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers based on the input; `ins` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `m` zeros; `cell` is a list of `k + 1` False values.**
