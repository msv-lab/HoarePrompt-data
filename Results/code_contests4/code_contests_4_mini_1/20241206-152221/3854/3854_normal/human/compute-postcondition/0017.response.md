According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `k`. The loop starts with `j` equal to 2 (as `j` is initialized to 2) and will iterate while `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than or equal to 3**
