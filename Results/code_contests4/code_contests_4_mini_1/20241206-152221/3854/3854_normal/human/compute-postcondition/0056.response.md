The variable `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is 3. Since `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`, the actual value of `nn[d]` will depend on the value of `d`. However, since `j` is 3, `nn[d]` will now hold the value 3. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is 1, `core[nn[d]]` is 1, `nn[d]` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is 1, `core[nn[d]]` is 1, `nn[d]` is 3.**
