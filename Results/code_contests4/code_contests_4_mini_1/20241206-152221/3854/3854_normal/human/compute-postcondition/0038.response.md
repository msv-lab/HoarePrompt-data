Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `core[j]` was equal to 0, then depending on the value of `d`, either `core[j]` is set to 1 (if `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true), or if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `nn[d]` is updated to 1, `core[j]` is set to 1, `cell[d]` is true, and `nn[j]` remains 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k` except `j=d`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `core[j]` is equal to 0, `cell[d]` is false, and `nn[d]` is updated to 1 if it was originally 0, with `nn[j]` remaining 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`.***
