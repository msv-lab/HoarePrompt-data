The variable `core` at index `j` (which is 2) is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, we calculate `i + 1`, which is 2. Thus, `core[2]` will be set to 2. The states of `n`, `k`, `j`, and `d` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`, and `core[2]` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`, `core[2]` is 2**
