According to the code, whether the loop can execute a second time depends on the value of `j` and `k`. The loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j = k`, inclusive. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented from its current value of 1 to 2. Additionally, `k` must be at least 2 to ensure that there is a second iteration.

At the beginning of the second iteration, `j` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is now 2**
