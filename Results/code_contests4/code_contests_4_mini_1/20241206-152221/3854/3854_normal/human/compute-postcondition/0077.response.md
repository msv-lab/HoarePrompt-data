`core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The current value of `i` is 1, so `core[j]` will be assigned the value `1 + 1`, which equals 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `j`, `nn[j]`, and `d` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1, `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`, `core[j]` is 2; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][1]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and the value of `cell[d]` is true.
