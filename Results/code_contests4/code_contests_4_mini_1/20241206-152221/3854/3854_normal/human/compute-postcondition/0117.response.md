To determine the conditions for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the current state and the loop statement.

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `k + 1`. This means that `j` will take on values starting from `1` up to `k`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is between `1` and `n` (inclusive).
   - `core[j]` is `2` for all `j` in the range from `1` to `n`.
   - `cell[d]` is `True` for certain indices `d`.
   - `nn[d]` holds the last `j` index for certain valid `d`.
   - For the loop to execute a third time, `m` must be greater than `2`.

3. **Execution Conditions**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as `k` is at least `2`, since the first iteration will set `j` to `1` and the second iteration will set `j` to `2`. For it to execute a third time, `k` must be at least `3` (which allows `j` to take the value `3`).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute a third time are:
- `k` must be at least `3`.

Given that `j` is already in the range of `1` to `n`, and `core[j]`, `cell`, and `nn` conditions do not affect the loop's execution directly for the current state, we focus primarily on the value of `k`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is between 1 and n, `core[j]` is 2 for all j in the range 1 to n, `cell[d]` is True for certain indices d, and `nn[d]` holds the last j index for certain valid d, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than 2.**
