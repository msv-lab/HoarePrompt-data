`nn[j]` is assigned the value 0. The value of `nn[1]` is already 0, and since `j` is 2, `nn[2]` will also be assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `nn[1]` is 0, and `nn[2]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `nn[1]` is 0, `nn[2]` is now 0**
