The code assigns a list of integers to the index `i + 1` of the array `ins`. The function `raw_input()` accepts input, and `map(int, ...)` converts the split string of input values into integers. The value of `i` is 0, so `ins[1]` will be assigned the values obtained from the input.

Since the specific content of the input is not provided, we can only describe the state in general terms. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ins[1]` is assigned a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ins[1]` is assigned a list of integers from input**
