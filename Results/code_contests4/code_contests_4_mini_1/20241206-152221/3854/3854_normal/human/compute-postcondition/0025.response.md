The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `core[j]` becomes 0 + 1, which equals 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`, `core[j]` is 1, `d` is assigned the value from `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`, `core[j]` is 1, `d` is assigned the value from `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.**
