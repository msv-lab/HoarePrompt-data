`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, and since `j` is 2, `nn[d]` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `cell[d]` is True, `core[2]` is 3, and `nn[d]` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `cell[d]` is True, `core[2]` is 3, and `nn[d]` is 2.**
