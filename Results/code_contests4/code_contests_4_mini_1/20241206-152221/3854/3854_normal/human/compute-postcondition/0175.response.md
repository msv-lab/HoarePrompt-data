The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, printing the value of `core[i]` for each iteration. After all iterations, `i` will have the value `n + 1`, and the loop will have printed the values of `core` from index 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains at its initial value of `m - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1` if `n` is greater than 0, or remains `m - 1` if `n` is 0; `core[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` has been printed.**
