Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `core[j]` is 0, `d` is assigned from `ins[1][2]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and the value of `cell[d]` is 0. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `core[j]` is updated to 3 and `nn[d]` becomes 1. If `nn[d]` was equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is now equal to 1.***
