According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `n`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least `1`. The current state indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer, but it does not specify whether it is zero or greater than zero.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `j` starts at `1`, which is appropriate for the first iteration. The other variables `i`, `k`, and `nn` do not directly influence this loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `n` to be at least `1`, and `j` is initialized to `1`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1, and `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`**
