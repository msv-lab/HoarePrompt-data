The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is 2, so the new value assigned to `core[j]` will be `2 + 1`, which equals `3`. The values of other variables (`n`, `k`, `j`, and `d`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][2]`, and `core[j]` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][2]`, `core[j]` is 3**
