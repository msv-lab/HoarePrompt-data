Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][1]`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` is updated to 2 and `cell[d]` remains true. If `cell[d]` is false and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[0] = 2`, `cell[d]` becomes true, and `nn[d]` is updated to 1. Conversely, if `cell[d]` is false and `nn[d]` equals 0, `nn[d]` is updated to 1 while the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `j`, `core[j]`, and `cell[d]` remain unchanged.***
