The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes input consisting of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, where each integer is within the range of 0 to `k`. The function performs operations based on these inputs but does not return any specific output value or message. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to handle a series of integer inputs organized in lines without returning any explicit result.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes inputs consisting of n lines of m integers within the range of 0 to k, but it does not return any output.**
