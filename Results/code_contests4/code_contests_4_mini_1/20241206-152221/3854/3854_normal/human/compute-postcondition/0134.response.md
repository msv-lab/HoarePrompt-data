The statement `nn[d] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the index `d` of the list `nn`. The value of `j` is given as 1. The initial state indicates that `d` is assigned a value from `ins[1][2]`, which is not specified in the problem, but it is mentioned that `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is True. It also states that `nn[d]` is not equal to 0 before the assignment.

Since `nn[d]` was not equal to 0 before this assignment, we are now updating its value to 1 (the current value of `j`). The other variables are not affected, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `core[j]` is 3, `d` is assigned from `ins[1][2]`, `cell[d]` is True, `nn[d]` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `core[j]` is 3, `d` is assigned from `ins[1][2]`, `cell[d]` is True, `nn[d]` is now 1.**
