The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, which is not specified but is assumed to be a valid index. The value of `j` is 3. The assignment `nn[d] = j` means that the element at index `d` in the list (or array) `nn` will be assigned the value of `j`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of 3.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of 3.**
