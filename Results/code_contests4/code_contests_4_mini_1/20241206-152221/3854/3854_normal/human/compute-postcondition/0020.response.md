According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The `for` loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, as it iterates from 1 to `n + 1`. The initial state shows that `n` is a non-negative integer, which means it could potentially be 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The initial values of `i`, `k`, and `nn[j]` do not affect the loop execution directly, but `j` will start at 1 and represent the current iteration index.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` is at least 1, and `j` will start at 1 for the first execution.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`**
