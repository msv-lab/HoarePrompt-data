According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 1, which means `n + 1` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
