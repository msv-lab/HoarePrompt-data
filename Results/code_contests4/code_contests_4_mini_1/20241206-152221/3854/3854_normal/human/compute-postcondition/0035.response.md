Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to 1, `core[j]` is set to 1, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[j]` remains 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k` except `j=d`. Otherwise, `core[j]` is equal to 0, `cell[d]` is false (or 0), and `nn[d]` is updated to 1 if it was originally 0, with `nn[j]` remaining 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`.***
