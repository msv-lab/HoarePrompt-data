The value of `d` is assigned from the list `ins` at the position `[j][i]`. Given the initial state where `j` is 3 and `i` is 2, the output state will reflect the assignment of `d` based on the values of `ins[3][2]`. Since no specific values for the `ins` list are provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `d`. However, we can state that `d` is assigned a value from `ins` based on the indices.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 3; `d` is assigned the value from `ins[3][2]**
