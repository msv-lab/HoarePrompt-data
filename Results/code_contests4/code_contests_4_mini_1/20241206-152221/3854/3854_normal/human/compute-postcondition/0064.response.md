According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a non-negative integer, we assume `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

After the next iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
