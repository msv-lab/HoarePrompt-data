According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1 since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k + 1`. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0, which do not directly affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` should be initialized to 1, as it will take the value of the first number in the range.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
