According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must also be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is now 4, and `nn[j]` is 0 (remains unchanged)**
