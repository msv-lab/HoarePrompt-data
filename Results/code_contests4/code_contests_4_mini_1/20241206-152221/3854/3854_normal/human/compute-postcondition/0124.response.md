According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` ranging from 1 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, as it determines the upper bound of the loop. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is 0, the loop will not execute. 

At the start of the loop, the value of `j` will be initialized to 1. The current states indicate that `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `core[j]` is 2 for all `j`, and `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` from 1 to `k`, which do not affect the execution condition of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1**
