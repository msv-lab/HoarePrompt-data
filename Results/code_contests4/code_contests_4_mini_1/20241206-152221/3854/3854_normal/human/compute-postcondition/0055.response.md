To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to consider the initial state of the variables and how they are affected by the code.

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`.
   - `cell[d]` is set to True.

2. The code snippet `core[j] = core[nn[d]] = i + 1` involves multiple assignments:
   - `i + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.
   - Therefore, `core[nn[d]]` is assigned the value `1`.
   - Then, `core[j]` (where `j` is 3) is also assigned the value `1`.

3. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `d`, and `cell[d]` remain unchanged, as the code affects only `core` and `i`.

Considering all of this, we can summarize the output state:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is 1, `core[nn[d]]` is 1**.
