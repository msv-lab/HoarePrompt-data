The value of `nn[j]` is assigned the value of `0`, and since it was already `0`, there is no change in its value. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `core[j]` is 2 for all j, `cell[d]` is True for certain indices d, and `nn[j]` remains 0.
