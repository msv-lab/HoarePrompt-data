According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is at least 1, which means the loop has already executed for `j` values of 1 and 2.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, resulting in `j` being 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (since `j` is now 3).

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, and `j` is 3 for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3.**
