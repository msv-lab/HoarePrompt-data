According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will execute for `j` starting at 1 and going up to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 4, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 4 (since the loop goes from 1 to k inclusive).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `core[j]` is 2 for all j, `cell[d]` is True for certain indices d, and `nn[j]` is now 0**
