Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `j` is 1, the element at index `j` of `core` is either 3 or remains 0, `d` is assigned the value from `ins[1][2]`, and `d` is not equal to 0. If `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` is updated to 3 and `nn[d]` becomes 1 if `nn[d]` was not equal to 0; otherwise, if `cell[d]` is false, then `nn[d]` is updated to 1 if it was originally 0.***
