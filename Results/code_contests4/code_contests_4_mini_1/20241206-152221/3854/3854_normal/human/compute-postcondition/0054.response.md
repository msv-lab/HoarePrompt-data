The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`, which is not specified in the initial state but is used as an index to assign `True` to `cell[d]`. The previous states of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `j` are not directly affected by this assignment, and since `cell[d]` is being set to `True`, we note that the value at index `d` in the `cell` array is being modified. Therefore, the Output State describes the unchanged variables along with the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][0]`, and `cell[d]` is set to True.**
