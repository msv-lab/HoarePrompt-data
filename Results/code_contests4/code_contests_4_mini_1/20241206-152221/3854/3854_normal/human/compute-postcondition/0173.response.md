According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3; for the loop to execute a third time, n must be greater than or equal to 3.**
