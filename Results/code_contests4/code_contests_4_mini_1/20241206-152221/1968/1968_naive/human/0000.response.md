To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and identify any potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine which players have a non-zero probability of winning the championship based on their token counts. The key point is that any player with tokens that can be combined with others (i.e., the sum of their tokens can support their continued play against others) may have a chance to win.

### Code Analysis
The program uses binary search to find the highest index `md` such that the sum of the tokens from players `0` to `md` is greater than or equal to the token of the player at index `md + 1`. The players who have a chance of winning are those indexed from `ans` to `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Single Player Case**: When `n = 1`, the only player should always have a non-zero probability of winning since they are the only participant. The output should be `1` and `1`, representing that player.
2. **Equal Tokens Case**: When all players have the same number of tokens, they should all have a non-zero chance of winning. For instance, if `n = 5` and the tokens are `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the output should be `5` and `1 2 3 4 5`.
3. **Higher Tokens with Insufficient Sum**: If there are players with very high tokens and others with very low that can't be combined to surpass the higher token players, then the program needs to efficiently identify which players can still win. For example, if `n = 3` and tokens are `[1, 2, 100]`, only the player with `100` tokens should be declared as they can win against the others without issue.

### Testing Edge Cases
- For a single player (e.g., `n = 1, a = [5]`), the code should output `1` and `1`.
- For equal tokens (e.g., `n = 3, a = [2, 2, 2]`), the output should be `3` and `1 2 3`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not handle the single player case or the equal token case correctly. It seems to be overly reliant on the sum of tokens and may fail to account for situations where players should still be considered winners even if they have less than the cumulative tokens of other players due to the nature of the game mechanics.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Failure
For the input:
```
1
1
5
```
Expected output should be:
```
1
1
```
However, the current program does not handle this case correctly as it assumes there are at least two players to compare. This indicates that the program fails in this edge case.
