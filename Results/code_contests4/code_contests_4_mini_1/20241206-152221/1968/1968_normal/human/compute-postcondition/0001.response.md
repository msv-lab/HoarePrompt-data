The code assigns a new lambda function to `rstrs`, which takes no arguments and returns a list of strings. The list is created by splitting a line read from standard input (using `stdin.readline()`) and converting each split element to a string. The previous value of `rstr` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts each element to a string.

Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts each element to a string.**
