The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `i` is `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2.
