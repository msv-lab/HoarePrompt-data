According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `md + 1` and `n`. The loop will execute if `md + 1` is less than `n`, which implies that `md` must be at least `n - 1`. Given that `md` is defined as `(n - 1) >> 1`, this means `md` is half of `n - 1` (integer division). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, ensuring that `md + 1` is at least 1.

Also, before the first execution of the loop, the value of `i` will start at `md + 1`. 

Thus, to summarize the necessary conditions:
- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure that `md + 1` is less than `n`.
- `i` should be initialized to `md + 1`.

State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, `su` is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of list `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 2, and `i` is `md + 1`**
