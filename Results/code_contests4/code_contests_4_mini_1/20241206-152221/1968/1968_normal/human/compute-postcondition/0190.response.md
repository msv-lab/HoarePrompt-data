The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`, replacing its previous value. The states of the other variables (`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, and `su` is -1.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, `su` is -1**
