According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition set by `n`. The loop is set to execute for `i` ranging from `0` to `md + 1` (which is `(n - 1) >> 1 + 1`), up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between `md + 1` and `n - 1`. 

Given that `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1` and `n` must be greater than `md + 1` for the loop to execute again, we deduce that:
- After the previous iteration, if `i` was `md + 1`, it will increase to `md + 2` for the next iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since at the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 1`, to execute the loop again, we require `i` to be `md + 2`, and `su` will be updated based on the condition given. 

State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, `su` is updated to `su + a[md + 2]` if `su` is not less than `a[md + 2]`, otherwise `su` is updated to -1 and we exit the most internal loop or statement, `i` is `md + 2`, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `md + 2`**
