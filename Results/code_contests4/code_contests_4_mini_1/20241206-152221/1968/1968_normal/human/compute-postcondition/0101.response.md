`su` is assigned the value of -1, which directly changes its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`.**
