According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `md` and `n`. The loop will execute if `md + 1` is less than `n`. Additionally, `be` must be adjusted to ensure that it is less than or equal to `en` to correctly calculate `md`. 

For the loop to execute:
1. `be` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `en`.
2. `md` must be such that `md + 1 < n`, which implies `md < n - 1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `md + 1`.

State: **`su` is the sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]`, `be` must be less than or equal to `en`, for the loop to execute the first time `md + 1` is less than `n`**
