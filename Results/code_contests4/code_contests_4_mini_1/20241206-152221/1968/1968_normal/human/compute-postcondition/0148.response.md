According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will execute again as long as `be` is less than or equal to `en`. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `su` is -1, then `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. This would mean that `be` is now greater than `en`, which would prevent the loop from executing again.

If `su` is the sum of `a[:md + 1]` plus the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, then `en` would be assigned the value `md - 1`. If this condition holds, for the loop to execute one more time, `be` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `en`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, if `be` is currently greater than `en`, we need to adjust either `en` to be at least equal to `be` or `be` to be less than or equal to `en`.

State: **If `su` is -1, then `be` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `en`; otherwise, for the loop to execute again, `en` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `be`.**
