`be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The initial state indicates that `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, so `be` will be calculated as `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, and the sum of the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` became less than any `a[i]` during the loop execution.

Output State: **`be` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, and the sum of the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` became less than any `a[i]` during the loop execution.**
