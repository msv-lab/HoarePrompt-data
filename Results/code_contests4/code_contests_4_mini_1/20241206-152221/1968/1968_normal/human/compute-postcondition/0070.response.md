The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
