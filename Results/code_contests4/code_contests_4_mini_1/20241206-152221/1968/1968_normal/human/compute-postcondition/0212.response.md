The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `a` has at least `md + 1` elements, and `su` is less than `a[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
