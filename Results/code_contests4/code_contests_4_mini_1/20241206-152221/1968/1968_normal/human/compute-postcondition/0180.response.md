According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will execute if `be` is less than or equal to `en`. Right before the loop, `be` is 0 and `en` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `be` must be less than or equal to `en`, which means `0` (the value of `be`) must be less than or equal to `n - 1` (the value of `en`). 

This condition will hold true if `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be at least 1.

State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 0**
