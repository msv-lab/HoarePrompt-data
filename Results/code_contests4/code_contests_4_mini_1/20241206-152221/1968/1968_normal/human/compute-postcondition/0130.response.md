The variable `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The previous value of `su` is unknown until we analyze the conditions, but we know that `su` is affected by `a[i]`. The value of `i` is defined as `md + 1`, and we can determine that `i` is at least 1 since `md + 1 < n` implies that `md` is at least `0`. 

However, the specific values of `a[i]`, `su`, and whether `su` was previously less than `a[i]` (and thus set to -1) are not provided. This leads to the conclusion that `su` could either be increased by some value of `a[i]` or if `su` was previously less than `a[i]`, it would have been set to -1.

Thus, for the output state, we can summarize that `su` has been modified, but without specific initial values, we can't define it exactly.

Output State: **`su` is modified by adding `a[i]`, where `i` is `md + 1` and `su` could be -1 if it was less than `a[i]` before this operation.**
