According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 1` and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `md + 1`. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being `md + 2`.

State: **`su` is the sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]` and is either -1 or greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `i` is `md + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`**
