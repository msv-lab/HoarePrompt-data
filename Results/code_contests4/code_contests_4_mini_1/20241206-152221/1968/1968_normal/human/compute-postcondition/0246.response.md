To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step:

1. The loop is defined to iterate from `md + 1` to `n`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `i` must be equal to `md + 1` or higher, but less than `n` for the loop to execute again.
3. The variable `su` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it. We need to consider the condition of `su` after this update:
   - If `su` was -1 before the update, it indicates a breaking condition, which means the loop will not execute again.
   - If `su` is still greater than or equal to `a[i]`, it means the loop can continue.

Given that the state mentions `su` was either -1 or greater than or equal to `a[i]`, we can conclude:
- If `su` was -1, the loop will not execute again.
- If `su` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, the loop can execute again.

Since the task does not specify which case `su` falls into, we will assume `su` is still greater than or equal to `a[i]` to allow for the next iteration.

4. Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, we set the new state:

State: **`su` is the sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]`, `i` is `md + 2` (to execute the loop again), and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.**
