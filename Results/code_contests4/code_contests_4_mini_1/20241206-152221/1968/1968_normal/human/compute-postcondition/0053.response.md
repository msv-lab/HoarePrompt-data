The value of `su` is assigned -1. There are no changes to other variables (`out`, `md`, `n`, `a[i]`, `i`) since they are not affected by this assignment. The conditions regarding `md`, `n`, and `su` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 3`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 3`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 3.**
