The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. This directly changes the value of `su` from its previous value, which was the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of list `a`. Other variables (`out`, `md`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en >> 1)`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en >> 1)`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`.**
