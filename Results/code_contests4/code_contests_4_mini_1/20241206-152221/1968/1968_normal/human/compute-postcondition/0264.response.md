Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a_i`. It determines the maximum size of a subset of `a` such that the sum of the subset is greater than or equal to each of its elements. The function returns the number of elements that cannot be included in such a subset and the corresponding elements of the list that make up that subset. If no valid subset is found, it may return `n` as the size of the excluded elements. **
