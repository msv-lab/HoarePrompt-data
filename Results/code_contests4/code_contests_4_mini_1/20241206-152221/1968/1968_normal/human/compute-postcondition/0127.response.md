The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous state of `su` is unknown, but it is specified that `su` is less than `a[i]`. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state reflects the new value of `su`.

Output State: **`be` is either `((n - 1) // 2) + 1` or `0`, `en` is either `n - 1` or `md - 1`, `md` is calculated such that `md + 1 < n`, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is -1 (assigned a value of -1)**.
