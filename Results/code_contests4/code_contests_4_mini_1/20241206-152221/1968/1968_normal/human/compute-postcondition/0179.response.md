`be` is assigned the value `0`, `en` is assigned the value `n - 1`, and `ans` is assigned the value `n`. The variable `n` is an input integer, so `en` will be `n - 1` based on the input value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`**
