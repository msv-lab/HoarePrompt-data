According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 1`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, which implies that `md + 1` is at least `n - 1`, making `i` equal to `n - 1` in the next iteration (as `i` will increase by 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `md + 1`. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `md + 2` (which is one more than `md + 1`), and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.

State: **`su` is updated to `su + a[i]`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `a` has at least `md + 1` elements, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`**
