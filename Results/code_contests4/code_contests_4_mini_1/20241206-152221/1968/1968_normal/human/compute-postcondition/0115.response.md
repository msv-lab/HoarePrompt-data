To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop and the given initial state. 

The loop iterates over indices from `md + 1` to `n - 1`. If at any point `su` (which starts as the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`) is less than the current element `a[i]`, `su` is set to -1 and the loop breaks. If `su` is not less than `a[i]`, it adds `a[i]` to `su`.

After all iterations, the following scenarios can occur:
1. If `su` is never less than `a[i]` throughout the loop, `su` will be the sum of the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`.
2. If `su` becomes -1 during any iteration (because it was less than `a[i]`), then `su` remains -1 for the output state.

Since `be`, `en`, and `md` remain unchanged throughout the loop, their values will be the same as in the initial state.

Thus, depending on the execution of the loop, we have:

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is either the sum of the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` or -1 if `su` became less than any `a[i]` during the loop execution.**
