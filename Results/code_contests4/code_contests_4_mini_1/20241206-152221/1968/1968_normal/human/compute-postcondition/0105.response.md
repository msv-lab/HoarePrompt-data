According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `md`, and `n`. The loop starts at `md + 1` and continues until `n`. Given that `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, the next value of `i` after the last iteration would be `i = md + 1 + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `su` is updated to `su + a[i]` where `su` was -1 and `a[i]` is the element at index `md + 1`. 

To determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, we need `i` to be less than `n`. The last value of `i` before this iteration would be `md + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `md + 2`, and therefore, `md + 2` must be less than `n`. This means that `n` must be greater than `md + 1`.

Thus, after the last iteration, the state needs to reflect `i` incremented to `md + 2`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `md + 1`.

State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is updated to `su + a[i]` where `su` was -1 and `i` is `md + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 1`.**
