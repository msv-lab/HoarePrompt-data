According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was at a certain value, and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Given that `i` is currently in the range from `md + 1` to `n`, after the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `md + 1` in the last iteration, it would now be `md + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.

State: **`su` is modified by adding `a[i]`; if `su` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `su` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, there are no additional actions specified; now `i` is `md + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.**
