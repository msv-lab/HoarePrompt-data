Output State: **`out` is a list containing the results of each iteration, including the values `n - ans + 1` and strings of integers from `ans` to `n` for each input case, `be` is greater than `en`, `ans` is the maximum valid size of the subset found across all iterations, and `su` is the last calculated sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]` or -1 if the condition was met during the last iteration.**
