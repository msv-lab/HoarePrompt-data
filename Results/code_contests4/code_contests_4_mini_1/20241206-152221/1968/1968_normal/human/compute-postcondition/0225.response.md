To derive the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop and the initial state. 

1. The loop iterates from `md + 1` to `n - 1`. If `md` is less than `n - 1`, the loop will execute for at least one iteration.
2. During each iteration, `su` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it, unless a condition is met where `su` becomes `-1`, causing the loop to break.
3. If `su` becomes `-1`, it indicates that at least one element in `a` was greater than the current `su`, and no further additions to `su` will be valid.
4. If the loop completes without breaking, `su` will be the sum of its previous value plus all subsequent `a[i]` values from `md + 1` to `n - 1`.

Considering these points, we summarize the final state after all loop iterations:

- If the loop breaks, `su` will be `-1`.
- If the loop completes without breaking, `su` will be the sum of the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, and `md` will remain less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`su` is either -1 (if the loop breaks) or the sum of elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `a` contains at least `n` elements.**
