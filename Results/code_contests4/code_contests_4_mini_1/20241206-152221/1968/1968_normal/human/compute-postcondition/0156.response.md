The value of `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is `md + 1`, this means that `a[i]` is the element at index `md + 1` in the list `a`. The previous value of `su` is -1. Therefore, the new value of `su` becomes `-1 + a[md + 1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `md` is calculated as the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is `-1 + a[md + 1]`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`.

Output State: **`md` is calculated as the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is `-1 + a[md + 1]`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1**
