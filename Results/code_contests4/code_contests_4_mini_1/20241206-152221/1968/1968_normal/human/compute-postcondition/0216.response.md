The value of `su` is assigned `-1`. The previous value of `su` was `su + a[i]`, but it is being updated directly to `-1`. The variables `md` and `n` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `a` has at least `md + 1` elements, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.

Output State: **`su` is -1, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `a` has at least `md + 1` elements, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2.**
