The value of `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. Since `md` is the integer division of `be + en` by 2, the exact previous value of `md` is not provided, but we know that `n` is greater than or equal to `md + 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `md` remains unchanged; `be` is now equal to `md + 1`.

Output State: **`md` remains unchanged; `be` is now equal to `md + 1`**
