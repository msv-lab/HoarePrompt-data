Postcondition: ***`md` is the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is -1, indicating that `su` was less than any `a[i]` during the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to `md + 1`, and `su` is either -1 or the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a` plus the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`.***
