Postcondition: ***`su` is either -1 or the sum of all elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]` plus the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n-1]`. If `su` is -1, then `i` is at least `md + 1` and `be` is `md + 1`. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of the specified elements, `i` is at least `md + 1` and less than `n`, `en` is `md - 1`, and `ans` is `md + 1`.***
