The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
