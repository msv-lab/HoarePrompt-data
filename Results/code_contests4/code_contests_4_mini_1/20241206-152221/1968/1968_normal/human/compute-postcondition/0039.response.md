The value of `md` is assigned the result of the expression `be + en >> 1`. The expression involves a bitwise right shift on `en`, which divides `en` by 2. However, the specific values of `be` and `en` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `md`. The other variables remain unaffected as they are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en >> 1)`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `md` is assigned the value of `be + (en >> 1)`**
