According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `md` and `n`. The loop will execute if `md + 1` is less than `n`. Since `md` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, we can deduce that for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `md + 1`. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` will start from `md + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `md + 1`. Additionally, `i` will be initialized to `md + 1`.

State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`**
