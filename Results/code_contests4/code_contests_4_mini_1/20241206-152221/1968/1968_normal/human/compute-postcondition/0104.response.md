The variable `su` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The current value of `su` is -1, and `i` is `md + 1`, which means `a[i]` is accessed at that index. Since the previous conditions state that `su` is less than `a[i]`, it implies that `su + a[i]` will yield a new value for `su`. However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not known since it depends on the specific contents of the list `a` and the value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is updated to `su + a[i]` where `su` was -1 and `a[i]` is the element at index `md + 1`.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is updated to `su + a[i]` where `su` was -1 and `a[i]` is the element at index `md + 1.**
