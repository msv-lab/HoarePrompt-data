Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list and `md` is less than `n - 1`. If `su` is -1, then `be` is assigned the value `md + 1` and there exists at least one `a[i]` that is greater than the current `su`. If `su` is not -1, then `su` is either updated to -1 if any `a[i]` is greater than the current `su`, or it is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`, plus the elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1` (if all those elements are less than or equal to `su`); `en` is `md - 1` and `ans` is `md + 1`.***
