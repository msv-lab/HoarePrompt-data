According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 1` and `n` is greater than `md + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to `md + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.

State: **`md` is calculated as the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is `-1 + a[md + 1]`, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`**
