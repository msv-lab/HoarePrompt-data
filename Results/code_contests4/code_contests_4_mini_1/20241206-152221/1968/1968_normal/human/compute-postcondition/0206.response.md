To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` condition `be <= en`.

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `be` and `en` are currently defined based on the value of `su`. 
2. If `su` equals -1, then:
   - `be` is set to `((n - 1) >> 1) + 1`
   - `en` remains `n - 1`
3. If `su` is not -1:
   - `be` is set to `0`
   - `en` is set to `(n - 1) >> 1 - 1`
4. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `be` is less than or equal to `en`.

Given the conditions:
- If `su` is -1, then `be` would be `((n - 1) >> 1) + 1`, and `en` would be `n - 1`. For the loop to run again, we need:
  - `((n - 1) >> 1) + 1` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
  - This is true for all values of `n` greater than 1.
  
- If `su` is not -1, then `be` is `0` and `en` is `(n - 1) >> 1 - 1`. For the loop to run again, we need:
  - `0 <= (n - 1) >> 1 - 1`, which implies that `n` must be at least 3.

Thus, we need to consider the cases for `su` being -1 or not:

- **If `su` is -1**: 
  - `n` should be greater than 1. No adjustments needed as `be` will always be less than or equal to `en`.

- **If `su` is not -1**:
  - `n` must be at least 3 for `0 <= (n - 1) >> 1 - 1`. We need to ensure that `en` is actually greater than or equal to `be`.

Thus, if `su` is not -1, we need to ensure that `n` is 3 or greater for the loop to run again.

State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, and `su` are defined based on the condition of `su`. If `su` is -1, then `be` is `((n - 1) >> 1) + 1`, `en` remains `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, and `su` is -1. Otherwise, if `su` is not -1, then `be` is 0, `en` is `(n - 1) >> 1 - 1`, `ans` is `(n - 1) >> 1 + 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, and `su` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` or remains the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a` if the loop does not execute, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 if `su` is not -1.**
