The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`, which directly changes its previous value. The states of the other variables (`md`, `n`, `i`, and the list `a`) remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`md` is calculated as the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]**
