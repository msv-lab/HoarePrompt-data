The variable `pr` is assigned a lambda function that takes `args` and `sep` as parameters. This lambda function uses `stdout.write` to join the elements of `args` (which should be iterable) into a string with `sep` as the separator and appends a newline at the end. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment of the new lambda function to `pr`.

Output State: **`rstr_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` strings read from standard input, each stripped of whitespace; `rstr` and `rstrs` remain unchanged; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into strings, and converts each string to an integer; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` lists of integers read from standard input; `pr` is a lambda function that takes `args` and `sep`, joins `args` with `sep`, and writes to stdout.**
