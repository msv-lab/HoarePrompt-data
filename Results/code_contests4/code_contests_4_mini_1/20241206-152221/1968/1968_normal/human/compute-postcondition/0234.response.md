`su` is assigned the value of the sum of elements from the beginning of list `a` up to index `md + 1`. The value of `md` is calculated as the average of `be` and `en`, which indicates that `md` is effectively determining the range of the sum. Since `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, the new value of `su` will now reflect the sum of the elements up to the calculated `md + 1`, thereby potentially changing its previous state. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is now the sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]`, where `md` is the average of `be` and `en`, `be` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `en`.

Output State: **`su` is now the sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]`, where `md` is the average of `be` and `en`, `be` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `en.**
