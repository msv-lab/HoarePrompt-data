Postcondition: ***`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, and if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is updated to -1 and the most internal loop or statement is exited. If `su` is not less than `a[i]`, the program continues executing the remaining code without any modifications to `su`.***
