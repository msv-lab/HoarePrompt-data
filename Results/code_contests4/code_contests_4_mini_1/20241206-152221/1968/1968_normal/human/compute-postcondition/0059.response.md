The variable `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. Since `md` is less than `n - 1`, the exact value of `be` will depend on the specific value of `md`. However, this operation does not affect the other variables (`out`, `su`). Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1; `be` is `md + 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1; `be` is `md + 1`**
