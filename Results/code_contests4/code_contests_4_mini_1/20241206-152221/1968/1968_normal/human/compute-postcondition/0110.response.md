According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and its relation to `n`. The loop is set to execute for values of `i` ranging from `md + 1` to `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2`, which means it is currently `md + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `md + 2`, it must be increased by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, we need to set `i` to `md + 3` for the loop to execute again. Additionally, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `md + 3` to allow for another iteration.

State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is `-1 + a[i]`, `i` is `md + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 3`**
