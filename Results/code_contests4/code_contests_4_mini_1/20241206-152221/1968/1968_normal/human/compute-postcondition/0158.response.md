The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous value of `su` was `-1 + a[md + 1]`, but now it is explicitly set to `-1`. The states of the other variables (`md`, `n`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `md` is calculated as the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`.

Output State: **`md` is calculated as the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2**
