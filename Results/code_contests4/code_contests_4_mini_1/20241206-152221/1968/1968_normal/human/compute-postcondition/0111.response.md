The value of `su` is assigned a new value of `-1`. The previous value of `su` was `-1 + a[i]`, but now it is simply `-1`. The states of the other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 3`, and the loop condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 3.**
