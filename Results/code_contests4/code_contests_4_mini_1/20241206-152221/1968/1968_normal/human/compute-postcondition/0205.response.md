Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, and `su` are defined based on the condition of `su`. If `su` equals -1, then `be` is set to `((n - 1) >> 1) + 1`, `en` remains `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, and `su` is -1. Otherwise, if `su` is not -1, then `be` is 0, `en` is `(n - 1) >> 1 - 1`, `ans` is `(n - 1) >> 1 + 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, and `su` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` or remains the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a` if the loop does not execute.***
