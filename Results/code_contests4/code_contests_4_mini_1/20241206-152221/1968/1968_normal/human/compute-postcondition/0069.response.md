The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous value of `su` was the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`, which was less than the element `a[i]`. However, we only have the new value for `su`, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `su`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]**.
