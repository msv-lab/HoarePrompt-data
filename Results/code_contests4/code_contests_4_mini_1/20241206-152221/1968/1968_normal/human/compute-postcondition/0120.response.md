To determine the output state, we start with the initial values provided:

- `be` is 0
- `en` is `md - 1`
- `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`
- `su` is not equal to -1
- `en` is now updated to `md - 1`

Next, we analyze the code snippet:
```
ans = md + 1
```

Here, `ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. 

Since `md` is defined as `(n - 1) // 2`, we can express `ans` in terms of `n`:
- Thus, `ans = ((n - 1) // 2) + 1`.

The other variables `be`, `en`, and `su` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `ans` and the unchanged state of other variables. However, without the specific value of `n`, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `md - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is not equal to -1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`**
