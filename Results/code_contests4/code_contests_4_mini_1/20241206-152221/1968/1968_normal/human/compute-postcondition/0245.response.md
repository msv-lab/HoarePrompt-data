Output State: **`su` is the sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]`, which is either -1 or greater than or equal to `a[i]`. After executing `su += a[i]`, the new value of `su` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it. If `su` was -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if `su` is still greater than or equal to `a[i]`, no action is taken regarding breaking out of the loop.**
