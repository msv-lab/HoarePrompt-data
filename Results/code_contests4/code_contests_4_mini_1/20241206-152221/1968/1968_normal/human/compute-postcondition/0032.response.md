Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, or `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`, plus the elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1` if all those elements are less than or equal to `su`, and there exists at least one `a[i]` that is greater than the current `su`.***
