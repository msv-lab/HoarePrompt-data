According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `md + 1` and `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `md + 1` must be less than `n`. Given that `md` is derived from `be` and `en`, we need to ensure that `md + 1` is a valid starting point for the loop.

1. The variable `md` is updated based on `be + en >> 1`. This means that `md` can be calculated from the values of `be` and `en`. 
2. If `be` is `0`, then `md` will be calculated as `(0 + en) >> 1`, which could still yield a value for `md` that makes `md + 1` equal to `1` (if `en` is at least `1`), allowing the loop to execute.
3. If `be` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, the value of `md` will be higher.
4. The loop will execute if `md + 1 < n`, which ensures that the loop starts at `md + 1` and can iterate through to `n - 1`.

To summarize, we need to ensure:
- `md + 1` is less than `n`.
- `i` must start from `md + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we can set the following states:

State: **`be` is either `((n - 1) // 2) + 1` or `0`, `en` is either `n - 1` or `md - 1`, `md` is calculated such that `md + 1 < n`, `i` is `md + 1`**
