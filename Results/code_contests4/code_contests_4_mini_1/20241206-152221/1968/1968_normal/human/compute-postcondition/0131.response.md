According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. The loop starts with `i` being `md + 1` and continues until `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. 

Given that `i` was `md + 1` at the start of the loop iteration, after the last iteration it becomes `md + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.

Also, `su` was modified by adding `a[i]`, and since `su` could be -1 if it was less than `a[i]` before this operation, we need to consider that `su` needs to be updated based on the new value of `i`. 

Thus, we adjust the states accordingly. 

State: **`su` is modified by adding `a[i]`, where `i` is `md + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`.**
