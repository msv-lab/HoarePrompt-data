To analyze the effects of the code snippet on the initial state, we need to consider how the variables interact based on the provided conditions.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `be` can take on two possible values based on the value of `su`:
     - If `su` is -1, then `be = ((n - 1) // 2) + 1` and `en = n - 1`.
     - If `su` is not -1, then `be = 0` and `en = md - 1`, with `md = (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `md` is defined as `(n - 1) // 2` in both scenarios.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `md = be + en >> 1` performs a calculation:
     - The expression `be + en` is computed first.
     - The result is then right-shifted by 1, which is equivalent to integer division by 2.

3. **Impact Evaluation**:
   - Depending on the values of `be` and `en`, we can derive a new value for `md`:
     - If `su` is -1:
       - `be = ((n - 1) // 2) + 1`
       - `en = n - 1`
       - Thus, `md = (((n - 1) // 2) + 1 + (n - 1)) >> 1`.
     - If `su` is not -1:
       - `be = 0`
       - `en = md - 1`
       - Thus, `md = (0 + (md - 1)) >> 1`.

4. **Output State**:
   - Without specific values of `n` and `su`, we cannot determine exact numerical values, but we can express the changes in relation to `n` and `su`.

Therefore, the resulting output state reflects the relations established:

Output State: **`be` is either `((n - 1) // 2) + 1` or `0`; `en` is either `n - 1` or `md - 1`; `md` is updated based on the expression `be + en >> 1`.**
