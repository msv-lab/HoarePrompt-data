The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is either `((n - 1) // 2) + 1` or `0`, `en` is either `n - 1` or `md - 1`, `md` is calculated such that `md + 1 < n`, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
