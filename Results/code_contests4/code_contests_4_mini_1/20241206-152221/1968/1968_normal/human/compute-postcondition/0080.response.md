The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `i` is `md + 3`, `su` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
