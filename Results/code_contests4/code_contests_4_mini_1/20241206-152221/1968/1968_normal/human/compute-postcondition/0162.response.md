According to the code, the loop can execute again if the current value of `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `md` is the integer division of `be + en` by 2, and it defines the starting point for `i` in the next iteration. Since `i` starts at `md + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `md` was calculated as the integer division of `be + en` by 2, and the current value of `i` must be `md + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be `md + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `md + 2`. 

State: **`md` is the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `i` is `md + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2`**
