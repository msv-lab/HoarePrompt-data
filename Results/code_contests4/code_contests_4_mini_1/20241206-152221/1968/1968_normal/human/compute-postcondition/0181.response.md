`md` is assigned the value of `be + en >> 1`. The value of `be` is 0, and `en` is `n - 1`. Therefore, the calculation for `md` becomes `0 + (n - 1) >> 1`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) >> 1`. The `>> 1` operation is a right bitwise shift, which effectively divides the value by 2. Hence, the value of `md` will depend on `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, then `md` will be calculated correctly, and the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`**
