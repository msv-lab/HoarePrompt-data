The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 1`, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
