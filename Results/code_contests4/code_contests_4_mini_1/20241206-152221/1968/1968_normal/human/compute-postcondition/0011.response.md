The variables `be`, `en`, and `ans` are assigned the values `0`, `n - 1`, and `n`, respectively. The value of `n` is from input, so it is an integer. The initial state of `out` remains unchanged as an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`**
