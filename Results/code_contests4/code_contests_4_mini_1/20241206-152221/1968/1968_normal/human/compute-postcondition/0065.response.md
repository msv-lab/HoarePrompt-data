The variable `md` is assigned the value of `be + en >> 1`. The operation `en >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift on `en`, effectively dividing it by 2. However, since we do not have specific values for `be` and `en`, we cannot determine the exact value of `md`. The initial states of `out` and `md` do not change except for the assignment to `md`. Therefore, the output state is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is assigned a value based on `be` and `en` through the expression `be + (en >> 1)`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is assigned a value based on `be + (en >> 1)`**
