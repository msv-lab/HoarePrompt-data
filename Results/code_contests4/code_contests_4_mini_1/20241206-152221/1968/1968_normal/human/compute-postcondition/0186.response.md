The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, `su` is -1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `md + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
