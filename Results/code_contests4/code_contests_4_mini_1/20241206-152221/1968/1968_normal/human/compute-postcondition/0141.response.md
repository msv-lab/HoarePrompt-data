To analyze the output state after the loop has executed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and its interactions with the variables.

### Key points to consider:
- The loop iterates over the range from `md + 1` to `n - 1`.
- During each iteration, it checks if `su` (the sum of elements) is less than `a[i]`. If it is, `su` is set to -1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `a[i]` is added to `su`.
- The loop will only execute if `n` is greater than `md + 1`.

### Analyzing the output state:
1. **If the loop does not execute**: This occurs if `n` is less than or equal to `md + 1`. In this case, `su` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `i` will not be defined since the loop did not run.

2. **If the loop executes**:
   - If during any iteration `su` becomes -1 (meaning the sum was less than the current element `a[i]`), the loop will terminate early. In this case, after all iterations, `su` will be -1.
   - If `su` does not become -1 during the iterations, it will be updated by adding the elements `a[i]` for each valid index `i` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`.

### Conclusion of the output state:
- If the loop does not execute: `su` remains as the initial sum of `a[:md + 1]`.
- If the loop executes and `su` becomes -1 at any point, then `su` is -1 after all iterations.
- If the loop executes without setting `su` to -1, `su` will be the sum of `a[:md + 1]` plus the sum of the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`.

Given this analysis, we can state the output state clearly.

Output State: **`su` is either -1 (if any `su < a[i]` was true during iterations) or the sum of `a[:md + 1]` plus the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` if the loop executed successfully. If the loop did not execute, `su` remains as the initial sum of `a[:md + 1]`.**
