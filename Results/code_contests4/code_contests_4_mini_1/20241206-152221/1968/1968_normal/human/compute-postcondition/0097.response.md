Given the initial state where `be` is 0 and `en` is `n - 1`, and for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, we analyze the code snippet provided:

```
md = be + en >> 1
```

The expression `be + en >> 1` calculates the value of `md`. The `>>` operator is a bitwise right shift, which effectively divides the result of `be + en` by 2.

Since `be` is 0 and `en` is `n - 1`, we can calculate `md` as follows:

1. Calculate `en`: `en` is `n - 1`.
2. Therefore, `be + en` results in `0 + (n - 1)`, which equals `n - 1`.
3. Applying the right shift operator: `(n - 1) >> 1` computes the integer division of `n - 1` by 2.

Thus, `md` will be assigned the value `(n - 1) // 2`.

In conclusion, the output state after running the code will include the updated value of `md`.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`**
