The value of `su` is increased by `a[i]`. However, since it is given that `su` is less than or equal to `a[i]`, after incrementing `su` by `a[i]`, it is possible that `su` could exceed `a[i]`, depending on the value of `a[i]`. If `su` ends up being less than `a[i]`, then it is set to -1, and we break out of the most internal loop. 

Given that we only have the information that `su` is less than or equal to `a[i]`, we cannot ascertain the new value of `su` without the specific value of `a[i]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation and the conditions met.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`, and if `su` becomes less than `a[i]`, `su` is set to -1 and we break out of the most internal loop.**
