The variable `su` is assigned the value of -1. The values of `md` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `md` is the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is -1.

Output State: **`md` is the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is -1**
