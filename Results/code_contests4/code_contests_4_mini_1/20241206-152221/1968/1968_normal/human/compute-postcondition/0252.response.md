Postcondition: ***`su` is -1, indicating that it became less than `a[i]` at some point. Additionally, `i` is at least `md + 1` and less than `n`, and `n` is the length of the array `a`. If `su` is not -1, it would be the sum of all elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]` plus the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n-1]`.***
