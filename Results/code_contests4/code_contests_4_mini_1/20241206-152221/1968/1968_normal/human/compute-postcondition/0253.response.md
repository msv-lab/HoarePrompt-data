`be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The previous state indicates that `i` is at least `md + 1`, which suggests that `md` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. The value of `su` remains unchanged as it is -1, indicating it has not been updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1, `i` is at least `md + 1`, and `be` is `md + 1`. 

Output State: **`su` is -1, `i` is at least `md + 1`, and `be` is `md + 1**.
