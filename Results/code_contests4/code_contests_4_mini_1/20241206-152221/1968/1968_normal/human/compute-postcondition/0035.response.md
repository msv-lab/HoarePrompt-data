Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is either the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`, plus the elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1` (if all those elements are less than or equal to `su`), or `su` is updated to -1 if any `a[i]` is greater than the current `su`, and `su` is not equal to -1; `en` is `md - 1`.**
