Output State: **`su` is modified by adding `a[i]`, and if `su` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, we proceed to break out of the loop, and the value of `i` is `md + 2`, with the condition that for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 2.**
