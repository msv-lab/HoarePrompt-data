Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`. If `su` is -1, `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. Otherwise, `su` is not -1 and is the sum of elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` if the loop did not break; `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, and `ans` is assigned the value `md + 1`.***
