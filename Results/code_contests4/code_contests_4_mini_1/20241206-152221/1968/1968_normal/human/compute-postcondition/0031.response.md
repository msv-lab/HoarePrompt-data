Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is either updated to -1 if any `a[i]` is greater than the current `su`, or it is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`, plus the elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1` if all those elements are less than or equal to `su`.**
