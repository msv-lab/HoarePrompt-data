Postcondition: ***`md` remains unchanged and `be` is equal to `md + 1` if `su` is -1. Otherwise, `md` is updated to the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `en` is updated to `md - 1`, `su` is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a` plus the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, with `n` being greater than or equal to `md + 1`, `su` is not equal to -1, and `ans` is `md + 1`.***
