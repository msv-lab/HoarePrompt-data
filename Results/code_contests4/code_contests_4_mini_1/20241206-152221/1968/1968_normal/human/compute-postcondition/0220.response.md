According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `md + 1`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, meaning `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

Since `md` is less than `n - 1`, it follows that `md + 1` is less than `n`, hence `i` can be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be `md + 2` for the next iteration.

State: **`su` is updated to `su + a[i]`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `a` has at least `md + 2` elements, and `i` is `md + 2`**
