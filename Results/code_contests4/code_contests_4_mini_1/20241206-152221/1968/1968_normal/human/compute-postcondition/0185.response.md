The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`, which overrides its previous value (the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of list `a`). No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, `su` is -1, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is `md + 1`.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, `su` is -1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `md + 1`**
