The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. The values of `out`, `md`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `i` is `md + 3`, `su` is -1.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `i` is `md + 3`, `su` is -1**
