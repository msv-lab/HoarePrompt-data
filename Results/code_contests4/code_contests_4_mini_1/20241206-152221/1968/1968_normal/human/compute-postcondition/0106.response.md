The value of `su` is assigned the value `-1` as per the initial state. However, it is already `-1`, so there is no change. The states of the other variables (`be`, `en`, `md`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, and `i` is `md + 2`.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`**
