The code defines a new lambda function `ceil1` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and calculates the ceiling of the division of `a` by `b`. The result is an integer that represents how many times `b` fits into `a`, rounding up if there's any remainder. The variable `out` is initialized as an empty list.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `ceil1` is a lambda function now defined to compute the ceiling of the division.
- `out` is initialized to an empty list.

The other variables (`rstr_2d`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ceil1` is a lambda function that computes the ceiling of the division of `a` by `b`, `out` is an empty list.**
