The value of `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The variable `md` is defined based on the values of `be` and `en`, but its specific value is not provided, only that `n` is greater than `md + 1`. Since `be` is being assigned a value based on `md`, we can infer that `be` will now equal `md + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `be` is `md + 1`.**
