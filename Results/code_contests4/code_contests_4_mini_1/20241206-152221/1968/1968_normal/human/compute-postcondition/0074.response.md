The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous state of `su` is not specified, but it is updated to `-1` directly. The other variables (`out`, `md`, `n`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is -1.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is -1**.
