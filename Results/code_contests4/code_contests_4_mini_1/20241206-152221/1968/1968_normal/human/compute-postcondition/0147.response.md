Postcondition: ***If `su` is -1, indicating that at least one `su < a[i]` was true during iterations, then `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. Otherwise, if `su` is the sum of `a[:md + 1]` plus the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` (indicating the loop executed successfully) or remains as the initial sum of `a[:md + 1]` (if the loop did not execute), then `en` is assigned the value `md - 1` and `ans` is `md + 1`.***
