According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user. The loop will execute for a number of times equal to the integer value returned by `int(input())`. If the input is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the input is at least 1. Since `out` is an empty list and `ceil1` is a lambda function, these states are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop.

State: **`out` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time input must be at least 1**
