The code assigns the value -1 to `su`. The previous value of `su` was the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`, which is still valid but is now replaced by -1. The other variables (`out`, `md`, `i`, and the elements in `a`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is -1**
