The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables `out`, `md`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is -1.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is -1**.
