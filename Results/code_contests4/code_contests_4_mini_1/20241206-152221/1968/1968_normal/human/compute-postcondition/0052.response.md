According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at `md + 2` and will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2`, and since `md` is less than `n - 1`, this means `i` (`md + 2`) is less than `n` (because `md + 2` is at most `n - 1 + 1`, which equals `n`). 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `md + 3`. For the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.

State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is less than or equal to `a[i]`, `i` is `md + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 3`**
