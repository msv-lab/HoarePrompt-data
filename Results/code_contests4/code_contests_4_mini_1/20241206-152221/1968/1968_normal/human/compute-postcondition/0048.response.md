The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous value of `su` was `-1 + a[i]`, but since `a[i]` is not defined in the current context, we disregard that. The other variables `out`, `md`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `su`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`**
