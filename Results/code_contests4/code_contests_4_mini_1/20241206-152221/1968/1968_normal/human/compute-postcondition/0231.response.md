Postcondition: ***`su` is either -1 (if the loop breaks) or the sum of elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`. If `su` is -1, `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, and `ans` is assigned the value `md + 1`.***
