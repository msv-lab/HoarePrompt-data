The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `md` is calculated as the integer division of `be + en` by 2, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
