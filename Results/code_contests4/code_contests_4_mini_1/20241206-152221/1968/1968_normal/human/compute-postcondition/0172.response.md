The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The previous value of `md` is known since `md` is the integer division of `be + en` by 2. Therefore, `ans` will be one more than `md`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`md` is the integer division of `be + en` by 2; `en` is updated to `md - 1`; `su` is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a` plus the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`; `n` is greater than or equal to `md + 1`; `su` is not equal to -1; `ans` is `md + 1`.**
