The variable `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`. The previous value of `md` is dependent on `be + (en >> 1)`, but the exact value of `md` is not provided. Therefore, `en` will be one less than whatever the current value of `md` is. The other variables (`out`, `su`, and `n`) remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `su` is the sum of the elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, and `en` is `md - 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `md` is based on `be + (en >> 1)`, `su` is the sum of the elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, and `en` is `md - 1.**
