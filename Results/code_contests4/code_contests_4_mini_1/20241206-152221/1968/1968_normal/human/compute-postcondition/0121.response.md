Postcondition: ***`be` is either `((n - 1) // 2) + 1` if `su` is -1, meaning the sum of elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` became less than any `a[i]` during execution, or `0` if `su` is not equal to -1, with `en` as `n - 1` in the first case and `md - 1` in the second case. Additionally, `md` remains `(n - 1) // 2` in both scenarios, and `ans` is assigned the value of `((n - 1) // 2) + 1` only when `su` is not -1.***
