Output State: **`be` is greater than `en`; `ans` is the maximum value of `md + 1` found during the iterations; `md` is the last calculated midpoint; `su` is either the sum of all elements from `a[0]` to `a[md]` or -1 if the condition for `su` was met during the last iteration; `out` is updated with the value `n - ans + 1`; `out` now contains a string of numbers from `ans` to `n` joined by spaces.**
