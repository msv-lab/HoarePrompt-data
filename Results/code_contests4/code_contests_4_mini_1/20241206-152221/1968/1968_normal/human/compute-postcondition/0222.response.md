The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is updated to -1; `md` is less than `n - 1`; `a` has at least `md + 2` elements; `i` is `md + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
