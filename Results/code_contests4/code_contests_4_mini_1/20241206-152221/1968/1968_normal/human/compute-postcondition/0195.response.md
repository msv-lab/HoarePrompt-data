The value of `su` is explicitly assigned -1. The previous state of `su` is undefined since it was previously updated based on a conditional statement. However, since `su` is now set to -1, it indicates that the condition within that statement was not met. The other variables `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`, and we exit the most internal loop or statement.

Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is `(n - 1) >> 1`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`, and we exit the most internal loop or statement.**
