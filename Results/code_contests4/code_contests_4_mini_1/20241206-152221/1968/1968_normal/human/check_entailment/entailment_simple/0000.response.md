To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: The first line contains the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, the first line contains the number of players `n`, followed by a line of integers representing the tokens each player has.
2. **Output**: For each test case, print the number of players who have a non-zero probability of winning the championship, followed by the indices of these players in increasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases correctly using the `input()` function and handles lists of integers representing the token counts.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the token counts, which is necessary to efficiently determine which players have a chance of winning based on their token counts.
3. **Binary Search Logic**: The program uses a binary search to find the maximum index (`ans`) such that the sum of tokens from the lowest indexed player to that index is less than or equal to the tokens of the player at index `md + 1`. This is a crucial step because it determines which players will potentially win based on the game rules.
4. **Output Generation**: It calculates the number of players who can win and their respective indices, and stores results in a list to print in bulk at the end.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly identifies players who have a non-zero chance of winning:
  - It uses a binary search to ensure that the tokens from the weaker players can cumulatively match or exceed the tokens of stronger players, following the game rules that the winner takes all tokens.
- It outputs the correct number of players who can win and their indices in increasing order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It efficiently calculates the players who have a non-zero chance of winning based on their tokens and adheres to the constraints provided.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
