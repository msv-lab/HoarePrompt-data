To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it in the context of the problem description about finding the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a complete graph with given edges of weight 1.

### Key Points from the Problem:
1. **Complete Graph**: The graph is complete, meaning every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
2. **Weights**: Each edge has a weight of either 0 or 1. Specifically, `m` edges have a weight of 1.
3. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: The goal is to find the weight of the MST.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Union-Find Structure**: The code uses a Union-Find (or Disjoint Set Union) structure to manage connected components of the graph.
2. **Edge Processing**: The program reads the edges of weight 1 and constructs a graph represented by a set of vertices connected by these edges.
3. **MST Calculation**:
   - The code identifies a vertex with the fewest connections (using `min(range(n), key=lambda i: len(sg[i]))`).
   - It attempts to union all other vertices with this "least connected" vertex, and if not directly connected, it unions them with each other.
   - Finally, it counts the number of unique roots in the union-find structure, which represents the number of connected components.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Zero Weight Edges**: The code does not explicitly handle the scenario of zero-weight edges. If there are vertices that are not connected by edges of weight 1, it may not correctly account for those edges when forming the MST.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 1` and `m = 0`, the weight of the MST should be 0, which the code handles correctly.
   - If `n = 2` and `m = 0`, the MST should also be 0 since there are no edges connecting the two vertices.
   - However, if `m` is less than `n-1` (not enough edges of weight 1 to connect all vertices), the MST cannot be formed, leading to an incorrect calculation of the weight.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not sufficiently handle cases where not enough edges of weight 1 are present to ensure that all vertices can be connected, leading to a faulty computation of the minimum spanning tree weight.

**Correctness: False**

### Example Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5 1
1 2
```
In this case, there are 5 vertices and only 1 edge of weight 1 between vertices 1 and 2. The expected weight of the MST should be infinite (or impossible to connect all vertices), but the program would output a weight of 4, which is incorrect.
