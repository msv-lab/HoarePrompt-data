The function accepts two parameters, `n`, a positive integer representing the number of vertices, and `m`, a non-negative integer representing the number of edges. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_4()` a total of `n` times, regardless of the value of `m`. The function does not utilize the `m` parameter in its execution, which may indicate a potential oversight or missing functionality related to the edges.
