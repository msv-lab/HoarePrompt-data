n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The function does not take in m directly, but m is determined by the number of edges with weight 1, which can be between 0 and min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). The pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) indicating the endpoints of the edges with weight 1 are provided in the input, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
