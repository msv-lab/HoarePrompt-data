The function accepts a tuple `x` containing two integers `n` and `m`, and returns the result of raising the tuple `x` to the power of `MOD - 2`, modulo `MOD`. However, this operation may not be meaningful as raising a tuple to a power is not a standard operation in Python, and could lead to unexpected behavior or a TypeError. Therefore, the functionality does not align with the annotations, which imply that it would work as intended.
