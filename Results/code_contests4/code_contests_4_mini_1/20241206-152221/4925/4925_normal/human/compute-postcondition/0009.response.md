Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `x` and `y`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It continues swapping the values of `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. The function then returns the GCD, which is the value of `x` at that point. It handles cases where `y` is initially 0 by directly returning `x` as the GCD. **
