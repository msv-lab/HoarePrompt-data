To determine the overall output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop behavior based on the initial state and how it processes its iterations. 

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.
The loop iterates `n` times with `j` taking values from 0 to `n-1`. For each value of `j`, if `j` is not in `sg[i]`, the `union(i, j)` operation is executed.

From the output states provided:
1. After the first iteration, `j` is 0 (as it starts from 0), and if `j` is not in `sg[i]`, a union operation is executed.
2. After the second iteration, `j` is 1, and again, if `j` is not in `sg[i]`, a union operation is executed.
3. After the third iteration, `j` is 2, and the same check applies.

Continuing this reasoning for all iterations up to `j = n-1`, we note that the loop will execute `n` times, with `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. 

After all iterations:
- The value of `j` will be `n` (as it increments to `n` after the last iteration).
- The variable `i` remains 1 throughout the loop.
- The effect of the `union(i, j)` operation depends on whether `j` is in `sg[i]` or not. If `j` is not in `sg[i]`, the union operation will alter the state (though the exact effect is not determined without knowing the implementation of `union`).
- The final state of `sg[i]` will be modified based on the number of unions performed.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will summarize the variables' values and their interrelations:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, and `sg[i]` may contain elements from 0 to `n-1` based on the union operations performed.**
