Functionality: ** The function processes a graph defined by a number of vertices `n` and edges `m` provided through internal function calls. It builds a connection between the vertices based on the edges and performs union-find operations to determine the number of connected components in the graph. Finally, it outputs the number of additional edges needed to connect all components, which is one less than the number of unique roots found in the union operations. The function does not accept parameters directly and relies on the internal definitions for graphs. **
