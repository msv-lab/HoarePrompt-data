According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2, which indicates that the loop has executed at least twice already (with `j` taking the values 0 and 1). Hence, for the loop to execute a third time, `j` will be 2 during that iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `j` is 2**
