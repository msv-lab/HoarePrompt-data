The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on the constraints provided for `n`, `m`, and the edges defined by pairs of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. The function processes these inputs internally to perform operations related to a graph structure. 

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided details. However, it likely returns a value or an indication based on the graph formed by the vertices and edges according to the specified constraints. 

Since the output specifics are not detailed, we cannot firmly conclude the exact return value or its conditions. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but processes graph data based on internal definitions of vertices and edges. It likely returns a value related to the graph structure formed by the provided constraints.**
