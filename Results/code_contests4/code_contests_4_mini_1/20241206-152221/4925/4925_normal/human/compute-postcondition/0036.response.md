According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`, which dictates how many times the loop will run. Since `n` is currently greater than 0 and `i` is 1, the loop has executed at least once already. For the loop to execute a second time, the value of `j` must be set to 1 (the current iteration). Also, for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain greater than 1, allowing for at least two iterations in total.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
