According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `j` can take a value of 3 or higher. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 4 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 4**.
