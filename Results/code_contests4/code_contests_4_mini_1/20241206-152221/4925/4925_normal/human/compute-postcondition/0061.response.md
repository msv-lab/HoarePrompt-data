Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. If `i` is not in `sg[v]`, the state remains indeterminate due to the execution of `union(i, v)`. If `i` is in `sg[v]`, for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, the union operation has been performed for `j` not in `sg[i]`, and `j` is equal to `n`.***
