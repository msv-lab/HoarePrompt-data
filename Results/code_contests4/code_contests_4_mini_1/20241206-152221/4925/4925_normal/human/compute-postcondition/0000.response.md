The expression `ceil(x / r)` calculates the ceiling of the division of `x` by `r`. Since `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices and `r` is an integer representing the number of edges, the output of this expression will depend on the specific values of `x` and `r`. However, the value of `r` must be greater than 0 to avoid division by zero.

Hence, the output state will reflect the fact that `ceil(x / r)` has been computed but will not specify a value since `x` and `r` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices; `r` is an integer representing the number of edges; the result of `ceil(x / r)` is calculated but depends on specific values of `x` and `r`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the number of vertices; `r` is an integer representing the number of edges; the result of `ceil(x / r)` is calculated but depends on specific values of `x` and `r.**
