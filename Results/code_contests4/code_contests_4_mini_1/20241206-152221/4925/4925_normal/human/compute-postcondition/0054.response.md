According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3**
