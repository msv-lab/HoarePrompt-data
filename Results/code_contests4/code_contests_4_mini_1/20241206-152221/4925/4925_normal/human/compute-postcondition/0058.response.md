The function `union(i, j)` is called with the values of `i` and `j`. The values are `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. The output state does not change `n`, `i`, or `j`, but it indicates that a union operation has been performed with the given values. The specifics of how `union` affects state are not provided, but we can confirm that it has been called.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and the function union(i, j) has been called.**
