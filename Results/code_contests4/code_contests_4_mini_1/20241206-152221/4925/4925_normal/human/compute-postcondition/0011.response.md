The function `union` accepts two parameters, `u` and `v`. Both `u` and `v` are integers representing vertices in a graph. The function does not return any value as the return statement is empty. Therefore, the functionality of the function `union` is to accept two integer parameters `u` and `v`, which represent vertices, and it performs an operation related to these vertices without returning any result. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters u and v, which are integers representing vertices in a graph, and it performs an operation without returning any result.**
