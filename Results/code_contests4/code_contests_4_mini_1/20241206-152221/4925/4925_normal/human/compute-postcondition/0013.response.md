The line of code `p[vc], vc = v, p[vc]` simultaneously updates the values of `p[vc]` and `vc`. The current value of `vc` is updated to the previous value of `p[vc]`, while the value of `p[vc]` is set to `v`. 

- `p[vc]` is assigned the value of `v`.
- `vc` is updated to the previous value of `p[vc]`.

Since `p[vc]` is the previous value of `vc`, we can conclude that `p[vc]` takes the current value of `v`, and `vc` becomes the previous value that was stored in `p[vc]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect these changes:
- `v` is equal to the value that was assigned to `p[vc]`.
- `vc` is now updated to the previous value of `p[vc]`.

Output State: **`v` is equal to `p[vc]`, `vc` is now updated to the previous value of `p[vc]`**.
