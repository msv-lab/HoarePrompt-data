According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0, as `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take on the values from 0 to `n-1` during the iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need `n` to be greater than 0, and initially, `i` will be 0 during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
