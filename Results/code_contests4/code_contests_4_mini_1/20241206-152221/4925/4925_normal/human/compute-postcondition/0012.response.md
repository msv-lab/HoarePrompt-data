Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `u` and `v`, representing vertices in a graph, and performs a union operation to connect these vertices in a union-find structure. If `u` and `v` are already connected, the function does nothing. If they are not connected, it updates the parent pointers and the rank of the trees in the union-find structure but does not return any result. The function does not handle cases where `u` or `v` are out of bounds or invalid. **
