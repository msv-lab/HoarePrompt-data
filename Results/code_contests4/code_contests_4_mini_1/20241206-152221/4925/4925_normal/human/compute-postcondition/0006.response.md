The loop uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The loop continues until `y` becomes 0.

When the loop terminates, `y` will be 0, and `x` will hold the value of the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. 

Output State: **`y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.**
