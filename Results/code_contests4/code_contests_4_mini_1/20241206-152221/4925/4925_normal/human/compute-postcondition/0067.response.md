The variable `roots` has the value of `find(i)` added to it. This means that the result of the `find(i)` function is appended or added to the `roots` collection. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but the `roots` variable will now contain an additional element corresponding to the value returned by `find(i)`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, the loop can indeed execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `roots` has the value of `find(i)` added to it.**
