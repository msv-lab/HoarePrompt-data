The function `func_11` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. Parameter `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, constrained such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^5\). Parameter `r` is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1, constrained such that \(0 \leq r \leq \min\left(\frac{x(x-1)}{2}, 10^5\right)\). The function returns the integer result of \((x + r - 1) // r\), which represents the ceiling of \(x\) divided by \(r\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_11` is to accept two integers, `x` and `r`, and return the ceiling of the division of `x` by `r` using integer arithmetic. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and r, and returns the ceiling of x divided by r using integer arithmetic.**
