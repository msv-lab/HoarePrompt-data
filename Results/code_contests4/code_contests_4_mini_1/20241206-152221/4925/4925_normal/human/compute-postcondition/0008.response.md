The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, constrained to the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5. `y` is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1, constrained to the range 0 ≤ y ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2), 10^5). If `y` is 0, the function returns the value of `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers, `x` and `y`, and return the value of `x` if `y` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, and returns the value of x if y is 0.**
