The function `union(i, j)` typically combines or links two elements in a data structure, such as a disjoint set, but the specific behavior depends on its implementation. Given the initial conditions, we know that `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `j` is not an element of the list `sg[i]`. 

After executing `union(i, j)`, the following impacts are noted:

- The union operation would involve `i` and `j`, where `j` is not currently in the list `sg[i]`.
- The state of `sg` may change to include `j` in the list associated with `i` (if `j` is added), but since we do not have specific details about the structure of `sg` or the implementation of `union`, we cannot assert the exact new state of `sg`.

Therefore, we can conclude that:
- The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged in terms of their values.
- The operation suggests a modification in the data structure, but without concrete details, we remain vague about the specific change.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `j` is not an element of the list `sg[i]`; union operation executed on `i` and `j`.**
