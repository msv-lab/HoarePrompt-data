x is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n is the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and m is the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)). The next m elements in the input represent pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) indicating the endpoints of edges with weight 1, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
