l is a list of tuples representing edges in a complete undirected weighted graph, where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a_i, b_i) indicating an edge with weight 1 between vertices a_i and b_i; start is an integer representing the starting vertex (default is 0), and end is an integer representing the ending vertex (default is 0). The number of vertices n is inferred from the maximum value in the tuples and must satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the number of edges m must satisfy 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2), 10^5).
