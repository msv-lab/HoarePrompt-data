The function accepts a tuple `o` containing two integers (n, m) and reads a line of input consisting of integers. It returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the corresponding integer from the input and the sum of the tuple `o` (i.e., the sum of n and m). If the input does not contain a sufficient number of integers to match the expected count (which is based on the number of integers provided in the input), the function may raise an error.
