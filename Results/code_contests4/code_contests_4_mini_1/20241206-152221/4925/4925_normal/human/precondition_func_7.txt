n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), and for each of the next m lines, there are two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) representing the endpoints of the edges with weight 1.
