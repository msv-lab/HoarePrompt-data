The function accepts a list of edges `l`, an integer `start`, and an integer `end`, and returns a range object that starts from `start` and extends to `len(l) + end`. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs, so it can potentially return a range that starts or ends out of bounds depending on the values of `start` and `end`.
