Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the given complete graph with the specified properties. Here are the key issues:

1. **Union-Find Implementation**: The program attempts to use a union-find data structure to connect vertices and count the number of unique components. However, it does not properly account for the edges with weight 1. Specifically, the way edges are processed and the union operations are performed do not ensure that the MST is correctly built based on the edge weights.

2. **Counting the Minimum Spanning Tree Weight**: The core requirement is to calculate the weight of the MST, which should consist of edges with weights of 1 and 0. The program outputs `len(roots) - 1`, which represents the number of edges needed to connect the components but does not directly correlate to the weight of the MST. The weight of the MST needs to account for the number of edges with weight 1 that are actually included in the MST.

3. **Handling of Zero Edges**: The program does not appropriately handle the case when there are no edges with weight 1 (when `m=0`). According to the problem description, if there are no edges with weight 1, the weight of the MST should be 0. The program's logic does not explicitly handle this case correctly, as it relies on the union-find structure's behavior rather than directly checking the number of edges.

4. **Input Handling**: The function `func_5` is supposed to read pairs of vertices corresponding to the edges with weight 1, but it might not be correctly structured to handle the input based on the problem's requirements.

Overall, the logic in the provided program does not align with the requirements of the problem description, particularly in how it processes edges and calculates the MST weight. Therefore, it does not fulfill the task as intended.
