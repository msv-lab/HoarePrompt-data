To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implemented logic:

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program should handle a complete undirected weighted graph with `n` vertices.
2. It should have `m` edges of weight 1, and all other edges should have weight 0.
3. The output should be the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of this graph.
4. The MST weight should be minimized, considering that edges with weight 1 contribute positively to the total weight.

### Annotations and Function Overview:
- **func_1** processes the input and builds the edge list.
- **union** and **find** functions are used for the union-find data structure, which helps in efficiently managing connected components.
- The main logic for calculating the MST appears to involve connecting components based on the edges defined.

### Key Points from the Code:
1. The program uses union-find to manage and combine components based on edges of weight 1.
2. It counts the unique roots of the union-find structure to determine how many edges are needed to connect all components.
3. The final output is `len(roots) - 1`, which represents the number of edges needed to connect `k` components (i.e., the weight of the MST).

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
1. **Case with m = 0**: If there are no edges of weight 1 (i.e., `m = 0`), the MST should have a weight of 0, which the code correctly handles as it directly counts components without any connecting edges.
2. **Complete Graph Consideration**: Since it is a complete graph, if `m < n - 1`, the output should reflect that additional edges are necessary to connect all vertices. The code should correctly identify that `n - 1` edges are required in total to connect `n` vertices.
3. **Handling of Edge Cases in union**: The `union` function does not handle cases where `u` or `v` are out of bounds or invalid. Although this case seems covered in the problem constraints, it's worth noting that lack of explicit checks could lead to issues if the constraints were not upheld.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle the basic cases as described in the problem statement, particularly regarding the counting of edges needed for the minimum spanning tree. However, the union-find structure lacks checks for out-of-bound vertices, and there is potential ambiguity when `r` is 0 in functions that involve division by `r` without checks.

Given these considerations, I do not find any explicit case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement based on the examples provided. The output for all tested scenarios adheres to the expected results.

Therefore, the final determination is:
Correctness: **True**
