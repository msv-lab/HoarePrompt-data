To assess the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of a complete undirected weighted graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges of weight 1. The edges that are not specified as weight 1 are implicitly assumed to have weight 0. 

### Code Overview
1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - Reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`.
   - Creates a list of sets to represent connections between vertices.
   - For each edge of weight 1, it adds the connection to both vertices.
   - It tries to find the vertex with the minimum number of connections and unions components that are not connected.

2. **Union-Find Logic**: 
   - The functions `find` and `union` implement a typical union-find structure.
   - `find` performs path compression, and `union` connects two components.

3. **Output**: 
   - The final output is `len(roots) - 1`, which represents the number of edges needed to connect all components.

### Edge Cases and Analysis
- If `m = 0`, then all edges have weight 0. The minimum spanning tree in this case should have a weight of 0, which is handled correctly by the output.
- If `n = 1`, the minimum spanning tree weight should also be 0 since there are no edges, which is implicitly handled as there are no edges to connect.
- The logic relies heavily on the union-find algorithm, which is appropriate for this task.

### Output Hints Evaluation
The output hints suggest that:
- The function outputs the number of additional edges needed to connect all components.
- The function does not directly handle cases where `m` is greater than `n - 1` because the minimum spanning tree of a complete graph with `n` vertices will always consist of `n-1` edges.

### Potential Issue
The code does not explicitly handle the case where `m` is very high, specifically when `m >= n - 1`. Although the number of edges is limited to `10^5`, the union-find structure may not correctly represent the minimum spanning tree weight if there are multiple connected components still remaining. 

Given that the output hints indicate potential issues with how the edges are processed and the union-find structure does not guarantee that all components are connected correctly when `m` is lower than required to form a complete connection, this raises a concern.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly compute the minimum spanning tree weight for all potential cases. In particular, when `m` is less than `n-1`, the number of unique roots found may not accurately reflect the edges needed to connect all components, leading to incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where not all vertices can be connected, particularly when the number of edges of weight 1 is insufficient to ensure connectivity among all vertices in the graph.
