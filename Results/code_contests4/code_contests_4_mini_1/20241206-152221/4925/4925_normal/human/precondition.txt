n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; m is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1, where 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2), 10^5); for each of the m edges, a_i and b_i are integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) representing the endpoints of the edge, with a_i ≠ b_i, and no edge appears more than once.
