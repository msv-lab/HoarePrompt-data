To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze its functionality in relation to the requirements.

The problem states that we have a complete undirected weighted graph with `n` vertices, where exactly `m` edges have a weight of 1, and the rest have a weight of 0. The goal is to compute the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of this graph.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a parent array `p` and a rank array `r` for Union-Find operations.
2. **Union-Find**: The `find` function finds the root of a vertex and applies path compression. The `union` function merges two sets based on the rank.
3. **Graph Representation**: The edges are read into a set `sg`, which tracks the vertices connected by edges of weight 1.
4. **MST Calculation**: It identifies a vertex with the minimum connections and then attempts to union it with all other vertices that are not directly connected.

### Issues Identified
1. **Union Logic**: The union operation seems to be incorrectly implemented. When uniting two vertices, if they are not connected, it should not arbitrarily connect them; instead, it should only connect vertices based on edges with weight 1.
2. **Counting Components**: The final count of components (`len(roots) - 1`) does not directly translate into the weight of the MST. The weight of the MST should consider the number of edges added to connect all components which is essentially the number of edges with weight 1 used.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n=1` and `m=0`, the output should be `0`, but the current logic may not handle this correctly.
   - When `m=0` for larger `n`, the output should also be `0` as there are no edges with weight 1.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, there are several logical inconsistencies and potential edge cases that this program does not handle correctly. It does not guarantee that the MST will be computed as per the graph's edge configuration, particularly due to its union logic and the way it counts the components.

Therefore, the final determination of the program's correctness is:

Correctness: **False**. 

**Reason**: The program does not correctly compute the weight of the minimum spanning tree, especially in cases where there are no edges with weight 1 or when there are disjoint vertices.
