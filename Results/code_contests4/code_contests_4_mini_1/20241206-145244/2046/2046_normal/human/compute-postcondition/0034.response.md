Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a level string made of characters '.' and '*'. For each level string, it identifies the positions of '*' characters, calculates the absolute differences of these positions from their median, and sums these differences. If no '*' characters are found in a level string, the function appends 0 for that test case. Finally, it prints the sum of absolute differences for each test case. The function processes up to 10,000 test cases with the combined length of the level strings not exceeding 1,000,000 characters. **
