Postcondition: ***`le` is a list with at least 1 element (a valid integer greater than 0). If `l` is non-empty, `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`, where `med` is the middle element of `l`. Otherwise, `af` is a list containing 0, indicating no differences, and `l` is empty. In both cases, `zorg` is the integer value obtained by popping the last element from `le`, and `n` is the integer value that was also popped from `le`.***
