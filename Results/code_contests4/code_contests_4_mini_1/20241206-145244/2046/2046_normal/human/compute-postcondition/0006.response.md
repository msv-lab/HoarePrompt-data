The code assigns to `l` a new list that contains the difference between the indices of elements in the original list `l`. The expression `enumerate(l)` generates pairs of indices (a) and values (b) from the original list, and `(b - a)` computes the difference for each pair. Since `l` is a list of indices where the original list had '*', the new values in `l` would depend on the specific indices. 

The other variables (`le`, `af`, `zorg`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated values of `l`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with at least 1 element (a valid integer greater than 0), `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value obtained by popping the last element from `le`, `n` is the integer value that was popped from `le`, `l` is a list of differences between indices and values in the original list.**
