The value of `med` is assigned the value of the middle element of the list `l`, which is determined by the integer division of the length of `l` by 2. Since `l` is not empty, the middle element exists and can be obtained. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `le` is a list with at least 1 element (a valid integer greater than 0), `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value obtained by popping the last element from `le`, `n` is the integer value that was popped from `le`, `l` is a list of differences between indices and values in the original list, and `med` is the middle element of `l`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with at least 1 element (a valid integer greater than 0), `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value obtained by popping the last element from `le`, `n` is the integer value that was popped from `le`, `l` is a list of differences between indices and values in the original list, `med` is the middle element of `l`.**
