Postcondition: ***`n` is the last element popped from `le`, and `l` is the list of indices where the elements in the original list are equal to '*'. If `l` is not empty, `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences from `med`. If `l` is empty, `af` is modified to include an additional element 0.***
