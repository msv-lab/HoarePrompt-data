To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, let's break it down step by step:

1. `med` is the middle element of the list `l`, calculated as `l[len(l) // 2]`.
2. The code `sum(abs(k - med) for k in l)` calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`.
3. The result of this summation is then appended to the list `af`.

We don't have the specific values of `l` or `med`, but we know that `n` is the last element popped from `le` and is not directly affected by this operation. Instead, `af` will be updated with the newly calculated sum.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n` and `l`, along with the updated list `af` which now includes the calculated sum.

Output State: **`n` is the last element popped from `le`; `l` is the list of indices where the elements in the original list are equal to '*'; `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences from `med`.**
