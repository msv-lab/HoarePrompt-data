The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It processes multiple test cases based on the constraints provided: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `n` is an integer that represents the length of a string consisting only of the characters '.' and '*', where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`. The output for each test case depends on the contents of the level string. 

Given the output conditions are not specified, we cannot elaborate on the exact return values. However, we can summarize the input handling. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases based on internal parameters and returns results based on the level string for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints.**
