According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value that is popped from `le`. The loop is set to iterate `int(le.pop())` times, and since `le` is a list, popping an element from it reduces its length. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the last element that was popped from `le`, and `zorg` has been incremented from the previous value.

To execute the loop one more time, the loop variable `zorg` needs to be less than the new value that will be popped next from `le`. Since `n` is the value that was just popped, to execute the loop a second time, the next value popped from `le` must be greater than `zorg`.

Letâ€™s denote the new value that will be popped from `le` as `m`. In the next iteration, `zorg` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than `zorg + 1`.

State: **`n` is the last element popped from `le`, for the loop to execute one more time the next element popped from `le` must be greater than `zorg + 1`.**
