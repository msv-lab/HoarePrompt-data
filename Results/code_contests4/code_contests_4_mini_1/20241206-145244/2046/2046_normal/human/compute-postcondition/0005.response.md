The code snippet assigns a new value to `l` based on a list comprehension. It creates a new list containing the indices `k` for which the condition `l[k] == '*'` holds true, iterating over the range from `0` to `n`.

Since `l` was previously an integer value popped from `le`, and `n` is also an integer value popped from `le`, the new `l` will be a list of indices where the elements in the original list `l` match the character '*'. However, because `l` was an integer and is now being reassigned to a list, the previous integer value of `l` is no longer retained.

Thus, the output state will reflect the change in `l` while noting that `af` remains an empty list and `zorg` retains its value.

Output State: **`le` is a list with at least 1 element (a valid integer greater than 0), `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value obtained by popping the last element from `le`, `n` is the integer value that was popped from `le`, `l` is a list of indices where the original list `l` had '*'**
