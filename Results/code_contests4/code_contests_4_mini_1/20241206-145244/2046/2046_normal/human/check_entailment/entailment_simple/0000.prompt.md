You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are playing the game "Arranging The Sheep". The goal of this game is to make the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one square to the right, if the corresponding square exists and is empty. The game ends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty cells between any sheep.

For example, if n=6 and the level is described by the string "**.*..", then the following game scenario is possible: 

  * the sheep at the 4 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "**..*."; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "*.*.*."; 
  * the sheep at the 1 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ".**.*."; 
  * the sheep at the 3 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ".*.**."; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "..***."; 
  * the sheep are lined up and the game ends. 



For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

The second line of each test case contains a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep) — the description of the level.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case output the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and the level string is of length n consisting only of the characters '.' and '*'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
    af = []
    for zorg in range(int(le.pop())):
        n = int(le.pop())
        
        l = le.pop()
        
        l = [k for k in range(n) if l[k] == '*']
        
        l = [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)]
        
        if l:
            med = l[len(l) // 2]
            af.append(sum(abs(k - med) for k in l))
        else:
            af.append(0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `le` is a list with at least one element remaining after all iterations; `af` is a list containing the sums of absolute differences for each processed line based on the median of the transformed list `l`, and its length corresponds to the last element popped from `le`. If no '*' characters were found in any `l`, `af` will contain only zeros for those iterations.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, af)))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
