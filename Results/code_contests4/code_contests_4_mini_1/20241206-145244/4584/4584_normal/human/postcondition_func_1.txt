The function accepts two parameters: `bottle`, representing the number of ordered bottles, and `cup`, representing the number of friends. It returns `False` if the bottle is empty or the cup is full. If neither condition holds, it attempts to pour milk from the bottle into the cup. If the amount of milk in the bottle is less than or equal to the space left in the cup, all the milk is poured into the cup, and the bottle is emptied. If there is more milk in the bottle than the space available in the cup, the cup is filled to its capacity, and the remaining milk in the bottle is adjusted accordingly. In both cases where pouring is successful, it returns `True`.
