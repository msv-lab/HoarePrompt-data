The function accepts an integer `x` and returns True if `x` is less than a small threshold `eps`. If `x` is negative, it checks whether the absolute value of `x` is also less than `eps`. However, the function does not define or handle the variable `eps`, which could lead to an error if `eps` is not defined elsewhere in the program. Therefore, the function's behavior is dependent on the existence and value of `eps`.
