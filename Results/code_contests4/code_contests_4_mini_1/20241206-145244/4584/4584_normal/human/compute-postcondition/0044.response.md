The function is called with the parameters `bottle` and `cups[ci + 1]`. The value of `ci` is the maximum index of full cups that is less than `m`, meaning `ci + 1` is the index of the next cup. If `ci + 1` is greater than `m`, the function would return an empty list but since we are proceeding without a defined return, we assume the function continues executing without returning anything. The values of `n`, `w`, and `m` remain unchanged as integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the function call.

Output State: **`ci` is the maximum index of full cups that is less than `m`; `n`, `w`, and `m` remain unchanged; function `func_2` is called with parameters `bottle` and `cups[ci + 1]`.**
