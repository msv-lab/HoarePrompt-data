The value of `ci` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ci` is unknown, but the increment operation will change its value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `w`, `m`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `w`, `m` are integers; `ci` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `w`, `m` are integers; `ci` is incremented by 1**
