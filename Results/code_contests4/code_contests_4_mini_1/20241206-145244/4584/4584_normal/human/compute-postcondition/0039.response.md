According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `bi` and `n`. If `bi` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ci` is equal to the maximum index of full cups that is less than `m`, and `n`, `w`, and `m` remain unchanged as integers. 

Since the loop variable `bi` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `bi` needs to be equal to the current value of `bi` plus 1. Therefore, if `bi` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `k + 1` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `bi + 1`. 

State: **`ci` is equal to the maximum index of full cups that is less than `m`, `n`, `w`, `m` remain unchanged as integers, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `bi + 1`**
