Postcondition: ***`n`, `w`, `m` are integers within their specified ranges. If `bottle` is not empty, the function returns an empty list, and if `ci + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, the function proceeds without a defined return value. If `bottle` is empty, the function does not execute any return statement.***
