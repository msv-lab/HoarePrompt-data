The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `n`, `w`, and `m`. The parameter `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000 (inclusive), and `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). 

After executing the function body, the behavior of the function is as follows:
- In Cases 1 through 6, the function returns an empty list `[]`.
- In Case 7, the function returns a list of ingredients from each Cup instance in the list `cups`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept three integers `n`, `w`, and `m`, and based on certain conditions, it returns either an empty list or a list of ingredients from Cup instances. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, w, and m, and returns an empty list under various conditions or a list of ingredients from each Cup instance in the list 'cups'.**
