To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we consider the following:

1. The loop iterates `n` times.
2. Within each iteration, it processes a `bottle` from the `bottles` list.
3. The variable `ci` is updated based on the fullness of the cups.
4. The loop can potentially return an empty list if certain conditions about the `bottle` being empty or cups being full are met.

Given that `n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, and `m` is between 2 and 50, we can deduce certain outcomes:

- If all `bottle` instances are full, and all cups become full during the iterations, `ci` will ultimately equal `m - 1`.
- If any `bottle` is empty at any iteration, the loop won't proceed with further `func_2` calls, potentially affecting the fullness of the cups.
- The variable `ci` will be updated to reflect the maximum index of cups that are full.

As a result, after all iterations complete, `ci` will be the highest index of cups that are full, and `ci + 1` will indicate whether there are any empty cups left or if it has reached or exceeded `m`.

Taking into account the above points, we can summarize the final output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(n * w) / float(m), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances, `ci` is the maximum index of full cups (which can be at most `m - 1`), and `bi` is equal to `n - 1`, the last index processed from the `bottles` list.**
