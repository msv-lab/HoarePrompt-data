Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(n * w) / float(m), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances, `ci` is an integer that is less than or equal to `m - 1`, `bi` is 0, and `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[0]`. If `bottle` is not empty, `func_2` is called with the arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci + 1]`. Otherwise, if `bottle` is empty, the function `func_2` is not called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci + 1]`.***
