The value of `ci` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ci` is between 1 and `m - 1`. Therefore, the new value of `ci` will be between 2 and `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(n * w) / float(m), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances, `ci` is between 2 and m, `bi` is 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[0]`**
