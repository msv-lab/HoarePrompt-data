The variable `Cup.capacity` is assigned the value of `float(n * w) / float(m)`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000, and `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, the expression `n * w` will yield a value between 100 (1 * 100) and 50000 (50 * 1000). Dividing this by `m`, which ranges from 2 to 50, means that `Cup.capacity` will take on a value that can vary based on the specific values of `n`, `w`, and `m`.

The output state reflects the relationship between these variables, noting that `Cup.capacity` will be calculated based on the current values of `n`, `w`, and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(n * w) / float(m)**
