The variable `ci` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `w`, `m`, `Cup.capacity`, and `cups`) remain unchanged as this line only affects `ci`. Thus, the Output State reflects the current state of `ci` and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(n * w) / float(m); `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances; `ci` is 0**
