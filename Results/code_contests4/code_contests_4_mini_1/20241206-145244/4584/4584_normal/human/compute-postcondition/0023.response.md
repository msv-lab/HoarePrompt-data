According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `bi` and `n`. If `bi` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `bi` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `bi` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `bi` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(n * w) / float(m), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances, `ci` is equal to `m - 1` if all cups from index 0 to `m - 2` are full, otherwise `ci` is the index of the first cup that is not full, `bi` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
