To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the function call `func_2(bottle, cups[ci])`. 

1. **Analyzing the variables:**
   - `bottle` has been assigned the value of `bottles[1]`.
   - `cups` is a list containing `m` Cup instances.
   - `ci` is determined by checking if all cups from index `0` to `m - 2` are full. If they are full, `ci` is `m - 1`; otherwise, `ci` is the index of the first cup that is not full.

2. **Impact of the code:**
   - The function `func_2` will receive two arguments:
     - `bottle`: a reference to the value of `bottles[1]`.
     - `cups[ci]`: a reference to the `ci`-th Cup instance in the `cups` list, which could either be the last cup if all prior ones are full or the first empty cup if not.

3. **No changes to the state of other variables:** 
   - The function call itself does not modify any of the variables but uses them as inputs.

Given that `bottle` and `cups[ci]` are passed as arguments to `func_2`, but we have no details on the internal workings of `func_2`, we can only conclude the values being used in this function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as float(n * w) / float(m), `cups` is a list of `m` Cup instances, `ci` is determined based on the fullness of the cups, `bi` is 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, and the function `func_2` is called with `bottle` and `cups[ci]` as arguments.**
