#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of different kinds of milk bottles (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), w is an integer representing the volume of each bottle (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000), and m is an integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ m ≤ 50).
def func_1(x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -x < eps
        #The program returns True if -x is less than eps, where x is an integer less than 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of different kinds of milk bottles (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `w` is an integer representing the volume of each bottle (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ m ≤ 50), and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
    return x < eps
    #The program returns whether x is less than eps
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns True if `x` is less than a small threshold `eps`. If `x` is negative, it checks whether the absolute value of `x` is also less than `eps`. However, the function does not define or handle the variable `eps`, which could lead to an error if `eps` is not defined elsewhere in the program. Therefore, the function's behavior is dependent on the existence and value of `eps`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bottle is an integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ bottle ≤ 50), cup is an integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ cup ≤ 50). Each bottle has a volume w (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000) which is constant for all bottles.
def func_2(bottle, cup):
    if (bottle.is_empty() or cup.is_full()) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that either the bottle is empty or the cup is full.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bottle` is an integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ bottle ≤ 50), `cup` is an integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ cup ≤ 50), and each bottle has a volume `w` (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000). The bottle is not empty, and the cup is not full.
    space_in_cup = cup.space_left()
    if (bottle.milk <= space_in_cup) :
        cup.milk += bottle.milk
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, bottle.milk))
        bottle.milk = 0.0
    else :
        bottle.milk -= space_in_cup
        cup.milk = cup.capacity
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, space_in_cup))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`bottle` is an integer representing the number of ordered bottles, `cup` is an integer representing the number of friends, and `space_in_cup` is the value returned by `cup.space_left()`. If `bottle.milk` is less than or equal to `space_in_cup`, `cup.ingridients` includes a new entry of `(bottle.no, bottle.milk)`, and `bottle.milk` is set to 0.0. Otherwise, `bottle.milk` is decreased by `space_in_cup`, `cup.milk` is assigned the value of `cup.capacity`, and `cup.ingridients` includes `(bottle.no, space_in_cup)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating the operation was successful
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `bottle`, representing the number of ordered bottles, and `cup`, representing the number of friends. It returns `False` if the bottle is empty or the cup is full. If neither condition holds, it attempts to pour milk from the bottle into the cup. If the amount of milk in the bottle is less than or equal to the space left in the cup, all the milk is poured into the cup, and the bottle is emptied. If there is more milk in the bottle than the space available in the cup, the cup is filled to its capacity, and the remaining milk in the bottle is adjusted accordingly. In both cases where pouring is successful, it returns `True`.

    bottles = [Bottle(i + 1, w) for i in range(n)]
    Cup.capacity = float(n * w) / float(m)
    cups = [Cup() for i in range(m)]

    return [cup.ingridients for cup in cups]
    #The program returns a list of ingredients from each Cup instance in the list 'cups'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (1 to 50), an integer `w` (100 to 1000), and an integer `m` (2 to 50). It creates a list of `n` bottles and `m` cups, calculates the capacity of each cup, and attempts to fill the cups using the bottles. The function returns a list of ingredients from each cup if all bottles are successfully processed without running into the conditions that would lead to an early return of an empty list. If any bottle cannot completely fill the cups or if there are more bottles than available cups, it returns an empty list.
