Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the total volume of milk from the bottles is less than the total volume required by the cups. Specifically, if `w * n < m * (w / m)`, where `w` is the volume of each bottle and `n` is the number of bottles, the program should output "NO". However, it may incorrectly attempt to distribute the milk among the cups without checking if the total volume is sufficient.

For example, consider the input:

```
n = 2
w = 100
m = 3
```

In this case, the total volume of milk is `2 * 100 = 200`, but the total volume required for 3 cups is `3 * (200 / 3) = 200`. The program fails to check if the number of cups can actually receive the total volume of milk, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios where it shouldn't be possible to distribute the milk as described.
