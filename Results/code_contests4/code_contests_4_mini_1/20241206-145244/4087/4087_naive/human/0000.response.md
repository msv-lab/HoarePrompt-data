Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is intended to count the number of different subsequences of a given sequence with lengths from 1 to n+1, but there are several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly.

1. **Incorrect handling of subsequence counting**: The method used for calculating subsequences does not properly account for the distinct elements and their repetitions. The formula for counting the subsequences is not reliable when there are duplicate elements.

2. **Division operation**: The program uses the division operator (`/`) for calculating combinations, which may lead to incorrect results in integer division scenarios. Python's division could result in floating-point numbers, and this could cause inaccuracies when dealing with large numbers.

3. **Failure to account for all subsequences**: The logic to determine `left` and `right` indices is flawed. It assumes that the first duplicate will dictate how to split the array, which may not always yield the correct number of subsequences. For example, in the input `1 2 1 3`, the first duplicate `1` is at indices `0` and `2`, but this does not help in correctly counting subsequences of length `2`.

4. **Modulo operation**: The use of the modulo operator appears to be incorrectly placed, which may lead to erroneous output. The proper use of modulo should be applied throughout calculations to ensure no overflow occurs.

A potential failing case is the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
Expected output:
```
5
15
25
25
15
1
```
The program does not correctly calculate the number of subsequences for all lengths due to the aforementioned issues. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description correctly.
