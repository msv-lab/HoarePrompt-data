Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Subsequences**: The program attempts to calculate the number of different subsequences by using a combinatorial approach that is not consistent with the requirements. It calculates the values based on the presence of duplicates and their positions, which does not guarantee that it counts all unique subsequences of lengths from 1 to n+1 correctly.

2. **Potential Division by Zero**: The code has a conditional path where if no duplicate is found, the variables `left` and `right` remain zero. This would lead to division by zero when calculating `x` because `pow[left + n - right]` would be `pow[n]`, which is valid, but the logic behind calculating the subsequences in this case would be flawed since it does not account for the required counts properly.

3. **Incorrect Use of Factorials**: The program calculates combinations using factorials but does not adjust for the cases where elements are repeated or their positions. The logic to calculate `ans` and `x` is flawed and does not correspond to the correct combinatorial counting of subsequences.

4. **Output Format**: The output of the program is not guaranteed to match the expected output format as described in the problem statement. It does not consistently ensure that the print statements output `n + 1` lines accurately reflecting the required counts for lengths 1 to n + 1.

Overall, due to these issues, the program fails to meet the problemâ€™s requirements for calculating the number of distinct subsequences of a specific length from the given sequence. The approach to combinatorial counting is incorrect, and edge cases where duplicates are involved are not handled properly.
