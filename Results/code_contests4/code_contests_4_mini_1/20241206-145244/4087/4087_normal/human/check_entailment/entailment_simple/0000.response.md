Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Subsequences**: The problem description requires the calculation of the number of different subsequences of a given length `k` (for `k = 1` to `n + 1`), but the program uses a method that relies on finding the indices of duplicate elements and does not account for all possible combinations that form subsequences. The formula used in the loops seems to deal with factorials but does not correctly compute the number of distinct subsequences based on combinatorial principles.

2. **Use of Division**: In Python 2, the division operator `/` performs integer division when both operands are integers. This could lead to incorrect results, especially when calculating the number of distinct subsequences where floating-point precision may be necessary. In Python 3, this would lead to a `TypeError` since the division does not yield an integer. The intended logic should use modular arithmetic to ensure results are always within the bounds of `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Index Handling**: The way that `left` and `right` indices are determined seems convoluted and may not accurately capture all subsequences, especially in edge cases where there are multiple duplicates or when the sequence is structured in a particular way.

4. **Lack of Proper Output Logic**: The output logic does not ensure that the number of subsequences for each `k` is calculated and printed correctly. The calculations are based on current indices and factorials without ensuring they reflect the actual subsequences.

5. **Missing Edge Cases**: There may be edge cases, such as when all elements are the same or when the sequence length is minimal, that are not handled properly, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
