To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code closely.

### Problem Description Summary:
The problem requires counting the number of different subsequences of a given sequence (with integers from 1 to n appearing at least once) for each possible length k (from 1 to n+1). The outputs must be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n+1`.
2. **Factorial Calculation**: It initializes an array `pow` to store factorials up to `n+1`.
3. **Finding Duplicates**: The program attempts to find the first duplicate in the list and uses its indices to help calculate subsequences.
4. **Combinatorial Calculation**: It calculates two combinatorial values based on the factorials and the indices of duplicates.
5. **Output**: It prints the result of a specific combinatorial difference.

### Edge Cases and Issues:
- The method used to find duplicates (`a.index`) will only find the first occurrence of a number. If there are multiple duplicates, the program may not handle it correctly.
- If there are no duplicates in the input, the indices `left` and `right` remain zero. This can lead to incorrect calculations, especially in the combinatorial calculations where division by zero might occur.
- The program's logic does not directly implement the combinatorial counting of subsequences as described in the problem statement. Instead, it relies on specific conditions involving duplicates, which may not cover all cases correctly.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe that the function prints the difference between two combinatorial values based on factorials and indices of duplicates. The hints also mention that if no duplicate is found, the function may produce incorrect results, which aligns with the concerns raised about the `left` and `right` variables.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required functionality for every potential input case as described. Specifically, it fails when:
- There are no duplicates in the sequence, leading to miscalculations or potentially division by zero errors.

Thus, based on the analysis of the code against the problem description and the output hints, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
