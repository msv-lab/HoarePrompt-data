The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is 1; `right` is the calculated index based on `a[x + 1:]`; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of factorials from 1 to `n + 1`; `tmp` is (n + 1)!; `i` is 1; `x` is the index of the element a[1] in list a, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
