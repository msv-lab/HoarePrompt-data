The code initializes a list named `pow` with a length of `n + 2` and fills it with zeros. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `left`, `right`, `mask`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `pow` will be a list of zeros with size `n + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a map object containing integers parsed from the input string; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of zeros with length `n + 2`.**
