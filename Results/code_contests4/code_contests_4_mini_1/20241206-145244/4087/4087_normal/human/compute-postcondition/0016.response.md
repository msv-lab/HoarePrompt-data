To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the provided code and the changes in variable states.

The loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`, which means it will execute a total of `n + 1` times. The variable `tmp` is initialized to `1` and is multiplied by `i` during each iteration. The resulting value of `tmp` is then stored in the `pow` list at index `i`.

After all iterations of the loop:
- On the first iteration (i=1), `tmp` becomes `1`, so `pow[1]` is `1`.
- On the second iteration (i=2), `tmp` becomes `2`, so `pow[2]` is `2`.
- On the third iteration (i=3), `tmp` becomes `6`, so `pow[3]` is `6`.
- This pattern continues until the final iteration (i=n+1), where `tmp` will be the factorial of `n + 1`.

Thus, at the end of the loop:
- `pow[1]` will be `1`
- `pow[2]` will be `2`
- `pow[3]` will be `6`
- ...
- `pow[n]` will be `n!` (factorial of n)
- `pow[n + 1]` will be `(n + 1)!` (factorial of n + 1)

The values of `left`, `right`, `mask`, and `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop executions. Therefore, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to n + 1, `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`.**
