According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n + 1`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, which means `n + 1` can be as large as 100,001. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1 to 2, and for the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is an index; `right` is an index; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of factorials; `tmp` is (n + 1)!; `i` is 2; `ans` is n + 1; `x` is calculated; and the output of print is (n + 1 - x) % 1000000007. For the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1 (which is at least 2 and at most 100001)`**.
