`pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is 2. The previous value of `pow[1]` is 1, but `pow[i]` (where `i` is 2) is now set to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `tmp` is 2, `i` is 2.
