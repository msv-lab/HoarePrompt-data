Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is 0; if `a[i]` is found in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, then `right` is the index of `a[i]` in `a[x + 1:]` plus `x + 1`, while `mask` remains 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`, `i` is 0, and `x` is the index of the element `a[i]` in list `a`. If `a[i]` is not found in `a[x + 1:]`, the program continues without making changes to `right`, `left`, or other variables.***
