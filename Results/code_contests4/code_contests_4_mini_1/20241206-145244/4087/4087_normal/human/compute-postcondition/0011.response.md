`tmp` is assigned the value of `tmp * i`. The previous value of `tmp` is 1, and `i` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `tmp` becomes 1 * 2 = 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `tmp` is 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `tmp` is 2, `i` is 2**
