To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the code and the initial state. 

The loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`, which means it will execute a total of `n + 1` times. During each iteration, the following calculations are performed:

1. `ans` is calculated as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`.
2. `x` is calculated as `pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])`.
3. The result of `(ans - x) % mask` is printed.

At the end of all iterations of the loop, the variables retain their final values based on the last execution of the loop, with `i` being `n + 1`.

- `ans` will be calculated using `i = n + 1`.
- `x` will be calculated using the final `left`, `right`, and `i`.
- The output generated in the last iteration will be the result of the last `(ans - x) % mask`.

After the loop completes, the values of the variables are as follows:
- `n` is still within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `left` is still an index (as defined in the initial state).
- `right` is still an index (as defined in the initial state).
- `mask` remains 1000000007.
- `pow` is a list of factorials for values from `1` to `n + 1`.
- `tmp` is still `(n + 1)!`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `ans` is calculated based on the last iteration.
- `x` is calculated based on the last iteration.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is an index; `right` is an index; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of factorials; `tmp` is (n + 1)!; `i` is `n + 1`; `ans` is calculated; `x` is calculated; and the last printed output is `(ans - x) % 1000000007.**
