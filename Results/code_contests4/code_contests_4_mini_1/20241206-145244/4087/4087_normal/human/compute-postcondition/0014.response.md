The value of `tmp` is multiplied by `i`, and since `tmp` is 2 and `i` is 3, the new value of `tmp` will be \(2 \times 3 = 6\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `tmp` is 6, `i` is 3.
