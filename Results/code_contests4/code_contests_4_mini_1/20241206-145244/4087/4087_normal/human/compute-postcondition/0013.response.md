According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n + 2`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 3. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n + 2`, which means the condition becomes `3 < n + 2`.

State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `tmp` is 2, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
