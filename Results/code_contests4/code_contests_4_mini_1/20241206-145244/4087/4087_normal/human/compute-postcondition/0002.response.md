The variable `left` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables, `n` and `a`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a map object containing integers parsed from the input string; `left` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a map object containing integers parsed from the input string; `left` is 0**.
