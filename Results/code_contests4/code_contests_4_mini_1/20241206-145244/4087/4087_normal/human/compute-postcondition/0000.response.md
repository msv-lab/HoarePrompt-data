The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` based on the user input. The list `a` remains unaffected in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length n+1 where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and every integer from 1 to n appears at least once in the list.**
