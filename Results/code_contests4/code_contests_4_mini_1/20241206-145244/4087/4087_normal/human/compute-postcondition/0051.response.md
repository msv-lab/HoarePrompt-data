Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at least once. It calculates and prints the difference between two combinatorial values based on the factorial of `n + 1`, the index of the first duplicate element in the list, and the index of that duplicate in the subsequent part of the list. The calculation is performed modulo `10^9 + 7`. If no duplicate is found, the function will still execute but may produce incorrect results as the indices for `left` and `right` will remain zero, leading to potential division by zero errors in the combinatorial calculations.**
