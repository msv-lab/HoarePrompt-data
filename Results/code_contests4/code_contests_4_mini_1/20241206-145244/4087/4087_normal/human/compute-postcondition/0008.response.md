The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `tmp * i`. The initial value of `tmp` is 1 and `i` is 1 for the first execution of the loop. Therefore, after executing the code, `tmp` becomes 1 * 1 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of zeros with length `n + 2`, `tmp` is 1 and `i` is 1.**
