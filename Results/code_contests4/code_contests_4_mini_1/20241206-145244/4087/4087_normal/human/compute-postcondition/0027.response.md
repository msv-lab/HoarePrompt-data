To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `left` is 1
- `right` is unchanged
- `mask` remains 1000000007
- `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range \(1\) to \(n + 1\)
- `tmp` is \((n + 1)!\)
- `i` is 1
- `x` is the index of the element `a[1]` in list `a`

### Code Execution:
```
right = a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1
```
1. The expression `a[x + 1:]` takes a slice of the list `a` starting from the index `x + 1` to the end of the list.
2. The method `index(a[i])` looks for the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in that sliced list.
3. The result of `index(a[i])` gives the position in the sliced list, and we add `x + 1` to convert that position back to the original list's index.

### Impact on Variables:
- The value of `right` changes based on the calculation of the index of `a[i]` in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`.
- The other variables (`n`, `left`, `mask`, `pow`, `tmp`, `i`, `x`) remain unaffected.

### Conclusion:
The output state will reflect the new value of `right` based on its calculation, while the values of the other variables will remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is 1; `right` is the calculated index based on `a[x + 1:]`; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of factorials from 1 to `n + 1`; `tmp` is (n + 1)!; `i` is 1; `x` is the index of the element a[1] in list a.**
