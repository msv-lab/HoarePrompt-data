To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `left` is an index
- `right` is an index
- `mask` is 1000000007
- `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1`
- `tmp` is (n + 1)!
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is n + 1
- `x` is calculated as `pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])`

When we execute the code:
```
print(ans - x) % mask
```

1. The variable `x` is computed using the factorial values from the `pow` list.
2. `ans` is equal to `n + 1`.
3. The result of the expression `ans - x` is computed.
4. Finally, this result is taken modulo `mask`.

Since the specific values of `left`, `right`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `x`. However, we know that `ans` will be `n + 1`, and `x` will be a calculated value based on the indices and factorial values.

Therefore, the output state must reflect that `ans` is `n + 1`, and `x` is derived from the calculation, while noting that the result of `print(ans - x) % mask` is executed.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is an index; `right` is an index; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of factorials; `tmp` is (n + 1)!; `i` is 1; `ans` is n + 1; `x` is calculated; and the output of print is (n + 1 - x) % 1000000007.**
