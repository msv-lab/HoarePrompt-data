The variable `left` is assigned the value of `i`, which has been incremented. The previous state of `i` is not provided, but since it is incremented, `left` will take on the new value of `i`. The other variables (`n`, `mask`, `pow`, `tmp`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `mask`, `pow`, `tmp` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented; `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`; `left` is now equal to the incremented value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `mask`, `pow`, `tmp` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented; `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`; `left` is now equal to the incremented value of `i`.**
