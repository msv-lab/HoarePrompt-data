The code assigns the value of `mask` to be `10 ** 9 + 7`, which evaluates to `1000000007`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a map object containing integers parsed from the input string; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; `mask` is 1000000007.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a map object containing integers parsed from the input string; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; `mask` is 1000000007**.
