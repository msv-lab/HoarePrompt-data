According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached its current value, which is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `n + 1` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`ans` and `x` are calculated using the factorial list `pow`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to `n + 1, i is n + 2`**
