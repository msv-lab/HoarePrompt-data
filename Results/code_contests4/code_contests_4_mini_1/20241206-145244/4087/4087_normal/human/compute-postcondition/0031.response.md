The code `x = a.index(a[i])` assigns the value of `x` to the index of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`. The variable `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. 

Since `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is assumed to be a list that contains elements, `a[i]` refers to the element at the new index `i`. The execution of `index()` will find the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the list `a` and assign that index to `x`. 

The values of `mask`, `pow`, `tmp`, and `n` remain unchanged, and we don't know the specific values of `a` or the previous value of `i` directly, but we know it has been incremented. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `mask`, `pow`, `tmp` remain unchanged; `i` is now incremented; `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `mask`, `pow`, `tmp` remain unchanged; `i` is now incremented; `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`.**
