The value of `x` is assigned the index of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`. The previous value of `i` is 1, so `x` will be the index of `a[1]`. Other variables are not affected, and we assume `a` contains elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is unchanged, `mask` remains 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the index of the element `a[1]` in list `a`.
