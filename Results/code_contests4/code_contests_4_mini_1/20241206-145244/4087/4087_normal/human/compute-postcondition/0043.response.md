The variable `x` is assigned the value of the expression `pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])`. The values of `pow`, `left`, `n`, `right`, and `i` already exist, and we need to calculate `x` using these values. 

Assuming the values of `left`, `right`, and `n` are such that `left + n - right` and `left + n - right - i + 1` are valid indices for the `pow` list, the output state will reflect the calculation:

- `x` will be calculated based on the values from `pow` at the specified indices.
- The variables `n`, `left`, `right`, `mask`, `pow`, `tmp`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

The output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is an index; `right` is an index; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of factorials; `tmp` is (n + 1)!; `i` is 2; `ans` is calculated as pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i]); `x` is calculated as pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])**.
