Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; if `a[i]` is found in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, then `left` is set to 1, `right` is updated to the calculated index based on `a[x + 1:]`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `mask`, `pow`, `tmp`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.***
