`pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. The previous value of `tmp` is 1 and `i` is 1, so `pow[1]` is set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[1]` is 1, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[1]` is 1, `tmp` is 1, `i` is 1**.
