To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
   - `left` is an index
   - `right` is an index
   - `mask` is 1000000007
   - `pow` is a list of factorials
   - `tmp` is (n + 1)!
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is calculated as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`
   - `x` is calculated as `pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])`

2. The line of code executed:
   ```
   print(ans - x) % mask
   ```

3. The impact of the code:
   - The variables `ans` and `x` are both computed using the `pow` list, which is based on factorial values.
   - The expression `ans - x` computes the difference between two calculated values.
   - Finally, this difference is taken modulo `mask` (1000000007), which ensures the result stays within a specified range.

Since we do not have specific values for `left`, `right`, `n`, or the `pow` list, we cannot compute exact numeric values for `ans` or `x`, but we know they are derived from the factorial values in `pow`.

4. The output:
   - The final output of the print statement would be the result of the calculation `(ans - x) % mask`.

Thus, the output state is dependent on the computed value, which we cannot specify without concrete values for `n`, `left`, `right`, and the `pow` list but can summarize the process:

Output State: **`ans` and `x` are calculated using the factorial list `pow`, and the result of `(ans - x) % mask` is printed.**
