The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), and `a`, which is a list of integers of length \( n + 1 \). Each integer \( a_i \) in the list satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and every integer from 1 to \( n \) appears at least once in the list. After executing the function body, it returns a specific integer from the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a list a of integers, returning a specific integer from the list based on the input constraints.**
