According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1 since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute `n + 1` times. 

The variables `left`, `right`, `mask`, `pow`, and `tmp` do not affect whether the loop executes, but they may be relevant for the loop body if it depends on those values.

At the start of the loop:
- `i` will start at 1.

Thus, the state can be summarized as follows:
State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is an index, `right` is an index, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`, `i` is 1**
