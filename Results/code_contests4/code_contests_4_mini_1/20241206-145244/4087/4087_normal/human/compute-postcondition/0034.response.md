The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `mask`, `pow`, `tmp` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented; `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`; `left` is equal to the incremented value of `i`; `right` is determined by the expression involving `a[x + 1:]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
