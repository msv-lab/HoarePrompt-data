Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is an index; `right` is an index; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1; `tmp` is (n + 1)!; `i` is 1; `ans` is n + 1; `x` is calculated as pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])**
