`pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is 6. The value of `i` is 3, so `pow[3]` now becomes 6. The other variables (`n`, `left`, `right`, `mask`, `pow[1]`, `pow[2]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow[1]` is 1, `pow[2]` is 2, `pow[3]` is 6, `tmp` is 6, `i` is 3.
