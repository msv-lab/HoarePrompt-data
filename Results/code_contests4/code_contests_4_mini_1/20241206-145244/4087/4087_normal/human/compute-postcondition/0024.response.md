According to the code, the loop iterates from `0` to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by `1`. Therefore, `i` will become `1`. Since the loop continues as long as `i` is within the range, it should still be valid for the next iteration as long as `n` is at least `1` (which it is, given the range constraint of `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`).

State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is unchanged, `mask` remains 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the index of the element `a[1]` in list `a`.**
