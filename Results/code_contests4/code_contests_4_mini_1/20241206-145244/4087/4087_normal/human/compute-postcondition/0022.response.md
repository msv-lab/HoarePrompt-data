The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is 0; `right` is the index of `a[i]` in `a[x + 1:]` plus `x + 1`; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1`; `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`; `i` is 0; `x` is the index of the element `a[i]` in list `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
