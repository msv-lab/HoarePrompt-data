Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `mask`, `pow`, `tmp` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented; `x` is assigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`. If `a[i]` is found in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, then `left` is set to the incremented value of `i`, `right` is determined by the expression involving `a[x + 1:]`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
