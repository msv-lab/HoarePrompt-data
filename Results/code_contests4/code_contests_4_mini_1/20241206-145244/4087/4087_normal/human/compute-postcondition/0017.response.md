According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. The loop is designed to iterate from `0` to `n + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `n` is at least `1` (since `n` is specified to be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Therefore, the loop can execute with the initial state provided.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take the value of `0` during the first iteration. The other variables `left`, `right`, `mask`, `pow`, and `tmp` do not affect the execution of the loop itself but may be used within the loop body.

State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to n + 1, `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
