To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the code and the conditions provided. The loop iteratively checks if the element at the current index `a[i]` appears in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, where `x` is the index of `a[i]` within the list `a`.

1. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`, meaning it can iterate up to `n + 1` times (from 0 to n inclusive).
2. The variables `left` and `right` are updated only if the element `a[i]` is found in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`. If such an element is found, `left` is set to the current index `i`, and `right` is set to the index of the same element in the sublist plus `x + 1`.
3. If `a[i]` is not found in `a[x + 1:]`, the loop continues without changing the values of `left` and `right`.

At the end of the loop:
- If there was at least one occurrence of an element in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, `left` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]`, and `right` will contain the index of that element found in the sublist adjusted by `x + 1`.
- If no such occurrence is found for any `i`, `left` and `right` will remain at their initial values of `0`.

Considering the above logic, we can conclude that:
- `n` remains unchanged as an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `mask`, `pow`, and `tmp` also remain unchanged.
- The final values of `left` and `right` depend on whether any elements were found in the sublist during the loop execution.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a duplicate element in `a` if found, otherwise 0; `right` is the index of the duplicate element in the sublist `a[x + 1:]` plus `x + 1` if found, otherwise 0; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1`; `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`.**
