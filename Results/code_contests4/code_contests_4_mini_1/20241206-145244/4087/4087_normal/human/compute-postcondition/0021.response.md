To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact it has on the variables based on the initial state provided.

1. From the initial state, we know the following:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is 0.
   - `mask` is 1000000007.
   - `pow` is a list containing factorials of integers from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is the index of the element `a[i]` in list `a`.
   - `a[i]` is present in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`.

2. The line of code being executed is:
   ```
   right = a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1
   ```

3. Here, `a[x + 1:]` is a sublist of list `a` starting from the index `x + 1`. The code looks for the index of the element `a[i]` in this sublist, which will return the zero-based index of that element relative to the sublist.

4. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`). The index of `a[0]` in the sublist `a[x + 1:]` is found, and then `x + 1` is added to adjust the index to the original list.

5. The output state will reflect the new value of `right`, which is now a calculated index based on the position of `a[i]` in the sublist plus `x + 1`. However, without knowing the actual contents of list `a`, we cannot provide a specific numeric value for `right`.

Thus, the output state will summarize the calculations and assignments made without specific values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `left` is 0; `right` is the index of `a[i]` in `a[x + 1:]` plus `x + 1`; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list where `pow[i]` is the factorial of `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n + 1`; `tmp` is `(n + 1)!`; `i` is 0; `x` is the index of the element `a[i]` in list `a`.**
