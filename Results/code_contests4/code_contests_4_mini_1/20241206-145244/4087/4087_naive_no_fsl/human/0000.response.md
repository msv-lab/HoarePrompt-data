Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k, as specified in the problem description. 

Here are some points that indicate the program's incorrectness:

1. **Incorrect Use of `index` Method**: The program uses `a.index(a[i])` to find the first occurrence of `a[i]`, but this can lead to incorrect results in cases where the same number appears multiple times. This does not correctly account for all occurrences of the integer in the sequence.

2. **Division in Calculations**: The use of the division operator ` / ` for calculating combinations (`ans = pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`) can lead to non-integer results as it does not handle modular arithmetic correctly. In Python, integer division should be performed using `//` when working with integers, especially under modulo conditions.

3. **Potential Issues with `left` and `right` Logic**: The logic implemented to find `left` and `right` indices does not cover all possible subsequences and their combinatorial counts, particularly in cases where the sequence has multiple occurrences of integers.

4. **Modular Arithmetic Mismanagement**: The use of modulo operator at the end of the print statement is not correctly placed. The result of `ans - x` should be taken modulo `mask` before printing, to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

5. **Inefficient Handling of Sequence Count**: The method to compute the number of different subsequences is not efficient and may not yield correct results for larger values of n, particularly as it does not utilize combinatorial mathematics in a robust manner.

For example, consider the input sequence `3 [1, 2, 1, 3]`. The expected output should be:
```
3
5
4
1
```
However, due to the flaws mentioned, the actual output may not reflect this correctly.

Thus, the program fails to address the requirements of the problem description in every potential case, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
