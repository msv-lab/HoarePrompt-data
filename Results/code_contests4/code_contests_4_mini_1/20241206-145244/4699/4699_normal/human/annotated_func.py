#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in n cells (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5), m is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), and k is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before morning (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(A, m, k):
    n = len(A)
    if (n == 1) :
        return min(A[0], m * k)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the amount of diamonds in the only cell A[0] and the product of m and k, where n is 1, indicating there is only one cell
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in `n` cells; `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations; `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes; `n` is an integer larger than 1, which is assigned the value len(A).
    if (n % 2 == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in `n` cells; `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations; `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes; `n` is an integer larger than 1, which is assigned the value len(A); `n` is an odd integer.
    moves = n / 2 + 1
    if (moves > m) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in `n` cells; `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations; `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes; `n` is an integer larger than 1 and odd; `moves` is `n / 2 + 1`, which evaluates to a non-integer value. The value of `moves` is less than or equal to `m`.
    M = min(A[0:n:2])
    return min(M, m / moves * k)
    #The program returns the minimum value between M (the minimum element of list A at even indices) and the result of (m divided by moves) multiplied by k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `A` representing the amount of diamonds in `n` cells, a positive integer `m` indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute, and a positive integer `k` representing the total number of minutes before morning. If there is only one cell, it returns the minimum between the diamonds in that cell and the product of `m` and `k`. If `n` is even, it returns 0. If `n` is odd and the required moves exceed `m`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the minimum value between the smallest number of diamonds in the even indexed cells of `A` and the product of `(m / moves) * k`, where `moves` is calculated as `(n / 2) + 1`.
