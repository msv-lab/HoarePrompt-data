Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `A` representing the amount of diamonds in `n` cells, a positive integer `m` indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute, and a positive integer `k` representing the total number of minutes before morning. If there is only one cell, it returns the minimum between the diamonds in that cell and the product of `m` and `k`. If `n` is even, it returns 0. If `n` is odd and the required moves exceed `m`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the minimum value between the smallest number of diamonds in the even indexed cells of `A` and the product of `(m / moves) * k`, where `moves` is calculated as `(n / 2) + 1`. **
