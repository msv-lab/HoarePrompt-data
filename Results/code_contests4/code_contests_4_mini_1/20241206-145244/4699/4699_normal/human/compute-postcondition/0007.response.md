The value of `moves` is assigned the result of the expression `n / 2 + 1`. Given that `n` is an odd integer larger than 1, we can express `n` as `2k + 1` for some integer `k`. Therefore, `n / 2` will be `k + 0.5`, and `moves` will be `k + 0.5 + 1`, simplifying to `k + 1.5`. Since `moves` is derived from the odd integer `n`, it will always result in a non-integer value, specifically a decimal number. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in `n` cells; `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations; `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes; `n` is an integer larger than 1 and odd; `moves` is `n / 2 + 1`, which evaluates to a non-integer value.**
