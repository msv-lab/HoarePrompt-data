The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `A`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `A` is a list of integers representing the amount of diamonds in `n` cells, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5`.
- `m` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute, where `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9`.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before morning, where `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`.

The function has several cases for its return value:

- **Case 1**: If `n` is 1 (meaning there is only one cell), the function returns the minimum value between the amount of diamonds in the only cell `A[0]` and the product of `m` and `k`.
  
- **Case 2**: The function returns 0.

- **Case 3**: The function returns 0.

- **Case 4**: The function returns the minimum value between `M` (the minimum element of list `A` at even indices) and the result of `(m divided by moves) multiplied by k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to evaluate the parameters `A`, `m`, and `k` to return different values based on specific conditions regarding the number of cells and the operations available to Joe. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `A`, a positive integer `m`, and a positive integer `k`. It returns different values based on specific cases involving the number of cells and the operations Joe can perform before morning.**
