The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `N` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^18, and `K` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^18. However, since the function does not take these parameters as input, we cannot determine specific behavior or output related to them from the given information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be clearly articulated without additional context on how `N` and `K` are utilized in the function body. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any input parameters and its return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
