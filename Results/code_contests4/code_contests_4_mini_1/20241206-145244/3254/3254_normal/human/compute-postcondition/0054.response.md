Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `j` is 0. If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then if `j` is less than `i`, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `j` is 2 or greater, `x` is set to 0 and `y` is set to 1.***
