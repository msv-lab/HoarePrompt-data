Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then the variable `x` is increased by 1; otherwise, since there is no else part, no changes occur to `x` or `y`.***
