The code initializes the variables `x` and `y` to 0. Since these variables are being assigned new values, they will overwrite any previous values they held. However, since `x` and `y` were not defined before this point in the context provided, we can summarize the state of the variables after execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(); `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `ans` is increased by `min(x, y)`.**
