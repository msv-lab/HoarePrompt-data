Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `N` is greater than or equal to 0; `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(); `ans` is the total sum of min(x, y) for each index `i`, where `x` is the count of elements in `a` less than `a[i]` that come before index `i`, and `y` is the count of elements in `a` less than `a[i]` that come after index `i`; `ans` is printed.**
