The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown, so the output state does not specify a new value for `x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `ans` is 0, `j` is 1, and `x` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `ans` is 0, `j` is 1, and `x` is increased by 1.**
