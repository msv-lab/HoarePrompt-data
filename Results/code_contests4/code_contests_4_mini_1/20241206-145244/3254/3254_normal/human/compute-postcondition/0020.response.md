Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `ans` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `x` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no else part, and no changes occur to the program state.***
