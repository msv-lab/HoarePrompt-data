Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(). If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and if `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `y` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
