Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), if `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1, `y` is 0, and the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `j` is 2 or greater, `x` is set to 0, `y` is set to 1, and the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`.***
