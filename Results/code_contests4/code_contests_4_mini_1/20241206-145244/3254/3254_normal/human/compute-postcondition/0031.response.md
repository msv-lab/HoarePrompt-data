Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(); if `j` is less than `i` and `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `x` is set to 1 and `y` is 0. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `x` is set to 0 and `y` is 1, while `a[j]` is still less than `a[i]`.***
