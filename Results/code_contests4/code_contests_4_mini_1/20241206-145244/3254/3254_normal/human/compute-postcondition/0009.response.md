Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |pi| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `ans` is 0. If `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1 and `y` remains 0, with `j` being 0 and the value of `a[j]` being less than the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0, `y` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, and the value of `a[j]` is still less than the value of `a[i]`.***
