The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `x` is 0, so after execution, `x` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `j` is 0, the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `j` is 0, the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `i`.**
