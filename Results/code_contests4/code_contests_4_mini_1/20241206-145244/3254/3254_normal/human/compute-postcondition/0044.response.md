Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5; `N` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(); `x` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than `a[i]` and have indices less than `i`; `y` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than `a[i]` and have indices greater than or equal to `i`; `ans` is increased by `min(x, y)`.**
