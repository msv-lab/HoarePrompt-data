Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `ans` is updated by adding min(x, y) to its current value, where `x` is the count of elements in `a` less than `a[i]` that come before index `i`, and `y` is the count of elements in `a` less than `a[i]` that come after index `i`.**
