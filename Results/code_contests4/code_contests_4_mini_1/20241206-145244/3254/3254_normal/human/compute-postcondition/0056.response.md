Output State: **The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `j` is 1, and `x` is increased by 1.**
