Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(); `x` is 0, `y` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. The element `a[j]` is less than the element `a[i]`.***
