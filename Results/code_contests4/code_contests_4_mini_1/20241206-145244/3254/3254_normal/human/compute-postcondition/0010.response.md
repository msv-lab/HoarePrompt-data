Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `ans` is 0. If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` and `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1 and `y` remains 0. Otherwise, if `a[j]` is less than `a[i]` but `j` is not less than `i`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `j` is 0 and `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`.***
