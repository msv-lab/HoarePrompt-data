Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `pi` satisfies |`pi`| ≤ 10^5, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of absolute values of integers from raw_input(), `j` is `N-1`, `x` is the count of indices `j` less than `i` for which `a[j] < a[i]`, `y` is the count of indices `j` greater than or equal to `i` for which `a[j] < a[i]`; `ans` is increased by the minimum of `x` and `y`.**
