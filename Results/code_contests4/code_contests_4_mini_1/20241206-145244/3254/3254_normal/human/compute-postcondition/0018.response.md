The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `y`. Since we do not know what `y` was originally set to, we can only indicate that `y` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is increased by 1**
