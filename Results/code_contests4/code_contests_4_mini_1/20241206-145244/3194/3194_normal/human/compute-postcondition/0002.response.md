`lines` is an empty list, and the code appends the result of `sys.stdin.readline()` to it. Since `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line from standard input, `lines` will contain one line of input after execution. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `lines` contains one line of input, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`lines` contains one line of input, `i` is 0**
