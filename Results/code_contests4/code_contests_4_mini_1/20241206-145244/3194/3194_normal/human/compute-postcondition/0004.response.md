The code appends a new line of input from `sys.stdin.readline()` to the list `lines`. The previous value of `lines` contains one line of input, and since `i` is 1, the loop will execute again. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `lines` contains one line of input plus the new line read from standard input, `i` is 1, and the loop will execute a second time since `i` is less than 3.

Output State: **`lines` contains one line of input plus the new line read from standard input, `i` is 1, and the loop will execute a second time.**
