The loop reads three lines of input from standard input and appends them to the `lines` list. After all iterations of the loop have executed, the `lines` list will contain exactly three lines of input, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to 3, indicating that the loop has finished executing.

Output State: **`lines` contains three lines of input, `i` is 3.**
