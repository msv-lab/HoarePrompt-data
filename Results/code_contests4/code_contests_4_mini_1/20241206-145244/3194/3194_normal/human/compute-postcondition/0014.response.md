Functionality: ** The function reads three lines of input representing a 3x3 matrix of characters ('X' for pressed buttons and '.' for not pressed buttons). It checks specific conditions regarding the presence of 'X' in these lines. If any of the conditions are met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. Potential edge cases include the possibility of receiving invalid input that does not conform to the expected 3x3 matrix format, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
