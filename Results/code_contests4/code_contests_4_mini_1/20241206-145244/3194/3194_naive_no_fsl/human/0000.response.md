To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the code and see if it correctly determines the central symmetry of the 3x3 matrix.

The symmetry checks required based on the problem description include:
1. The top-left corner must mirror the bottom-right corner.
2. The top-middle must mirror the bottom-middle.
3. The top-right corner must mirror the bottom-left corner.
4. The middle-left must mirror the middle-right.

The program currently checks the following conditions:

```python
if lines[0][0] == 'X' and lines[2][2] != 'X' or (lines[0][1] == 'X' and lines[2][1] != 'X') or (lines[0][2] == 'X' and lines[2][0] != 'X') or (lines[1][0] == 'X' and lines[1][2] != 'X') or (lines[1][2] == 'X' and lines[1][0] != 'X'):
```

However, this condition does not check all necessary pairs for symmetry. For example, it does not consider the middle row at all, and it seems to be overly complicated without handling all symmetry cases comprehensively.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:

```
X.X
.X.
X.X
```
Expected output: `YES` (the matrix is symmetric)
Actual output: The program would output `NO` because it would incorrectly evaluate the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle all cases of central symmetry correctly as specified in the problem description. Therefore, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**
