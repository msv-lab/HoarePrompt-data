You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given three strings A, B and C. Each of these is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Our objective is to make all these three strings equal. For that, you can repeatedly perform the following operation:

* Operation: Choose one of the strings A, B and C, and specify an integer i between 1 and N (inclusive). Change the i-th character from the beginning of the chosen string to some other lowercase English letter.



What is the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* Each of the strings A, B and C is a string of length N.
* Each character in each of the strings A, B and C is a lowercase English letter.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, and A, B, and C are strings of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    a = [raw_input().strip() for i in xrange(3)]
    foo = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        bucket = {}
        
        for s in a:
            bucket[s[i]] = True
        
        foo += len(bucket) - 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100; `n` is at least 1; `foo` is increased by `(n * (number of distinct elements in a - 1))`; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `bucket` contains keys for all distinct elements in `a` for each iteration; `a` is a list with at least `len(a)` elements.
    print(foo)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three strings A, B, and C, each of length N (where 1 <= N <= 100). It calculates the number of distinct characters at each index across the three strings and sums the count of these distinct characters minus one for each index. Finally, it prints the total sum. The function does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
