The code creates a list `a` that gathers input from the user. The `raw_input()` function accepts input as a string, which is then stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The list comprehension runs three times (due to `xrange(3)`), resulting in three user inputs being collected into the list `a`. The value of `N` remains unchanged, and `n` is specified as an input integer but is not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list containing 3 user inputs.**
