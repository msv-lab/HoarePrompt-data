The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input string, `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be a positive integer based on the input provided, and it will fall within the range specified (1 to 100). The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100; `n` is an input integer**
