The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `A`, `B`, and `C`. Each of these parameters is a string of length `N`, where `N` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq N \leq 100\). After executing the function body, the function processes these strings and returns a value based on certain conditions related to their content. However, the specific output conditions are not provided. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three strings `A`, `B`, and `C`, each of length `N`, where `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The function then processes these strings and returns an output based on its internal logic. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three strings A, B, and C, each of length N (1 <= N <= 100). The function processes these strings and returns a value based on specific conditions related to the strings.**
