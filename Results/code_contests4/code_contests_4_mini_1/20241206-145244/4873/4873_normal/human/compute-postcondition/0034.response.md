Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100; `n` is at least 1; `foo` is increased by `(n * (number of distinct elements in a - 1))`; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `bucket` contains keys for all distinct elements in `a` for each iteration; `a` is a list with at least `len(a)` elements; `foo` is printed.**
