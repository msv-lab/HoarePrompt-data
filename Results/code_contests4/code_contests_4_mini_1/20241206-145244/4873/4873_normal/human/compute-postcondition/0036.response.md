Functionality: ** The function accepts three strings A, B, and C, each of length N (where 1 <= N <= 100). It calculates the number of distinct characters at each index across the three strings and sums the count of these distinct characters minus one for each index. Finally, it prints the total sum. The function does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the result. **
