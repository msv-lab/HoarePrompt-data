To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the `func_1` function.

### Problem Summary
The objective is to make three strings \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) equal by performing the specified operation (changing a character in one of the strings). We need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this goal.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) (the length of the strings).
   - It then reads three strings into a list `a`.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The loop iterates through each character position \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - A `bucket` dictionary is created to store unique characters at the \( i \)-th position across the three strings.
   - The number of changes needed for each character position is calculated as `len(bucket) - 1`, which represents how many characters need to be changed to make them all the same.

3. **Computational Logic**:
   - The total number of changes (or operations) required is accumulated in the variable `foo`.

### Evaluating Edge Cases
Let's consider some potential edge cases:

- **All Characters the Same**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    3
    aaa
    aaa
    aaa
    ```
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Program Output: `0` (correct)

- **Two Strings Same, One Different**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    3
    aaa
    aaa
    aab
    ```
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Program Output: `1` (correct)

- **Completely Different Strings**: 
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    abc
    def
    ghi
    ```
  - Expected Output: `6` (change all characters)
  - Program Output: `6` (correct)

- **Single Character Change**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    3
    abc
    adc
    acc
    ```
  - Expected Output: `2` (change 'b' to 'd' and 'c' to 'c')
  - Program Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required in the tested cases. The logic of using a dictionary to count unique characters at each position is valid, and the count of characters needing to be changed is correctly implemented.

### Final Verdict
Since I have not found any case where the program fails to satisfy the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the three strings equal in all examined cases.
