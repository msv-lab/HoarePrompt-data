According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `k` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. 

State: **`n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 0**
