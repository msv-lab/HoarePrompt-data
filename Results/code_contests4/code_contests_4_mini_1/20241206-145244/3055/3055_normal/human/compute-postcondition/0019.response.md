The value of `j` is incremented by 1, which means that the new value of `j` will be the previous value plus 1. The other variables `n`, `col`, and `mtrx[k]` remain unaffected by this operation. The loop will continue executing if `m` is greater than the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `col` is a string input from `raw_input()`, `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[j]`, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `col` is a string input from `raw_input()`, `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[j]`, and `j` is increased by 1.**
