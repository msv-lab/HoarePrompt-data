The variable `frnds` is modified by adding the value from `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to it. The values of `i`, `j`, and `m` are used to access the elements of the matrix `mtrx`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is equal to `m`, which is greater than 0, `j - 1` will be a valid index to access the matrix. The previous values of `k`, `j`, `m`, and `i` do not directly affect the addition to `frnds`, but we assume `mtrx` is structured properly for these indices.

Therefore, the output state is: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `frnds` now includes the value from `mtrx[1][m - 1]`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `frnds` now includes the value from `mtrx[1][m - 1]**.
