Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. If `j - 1` is greater than 0, then `frnds` includes the element `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, the element at position `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, the element at position `mtrx[i][j]` is not equal to '.', and `j + 1` is less than `m`.***
