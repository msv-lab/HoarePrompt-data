The code adds the value from `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `i` is 1, and `j` is equal to `m`, where `m` is greater than 0. Since `j` is equal to `m`, `j + 1` will be `m + 1`, which is still valid because `m` is greater than 0. 

The value `mtrx[i][j + 1]` will be accessed, and that value will be added to the set `frnds`. The condition regarding `j - 1` does not affect the execution of this line of code, as it only determines if `frnds` would include another value prior to this line. 

Since `frnds` is modified by adding a new element, the output state will reflect the addition of the value from `mtrx[1][m + 1]` without changing the existing values of `k`, `j`, `m`, or `i`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `frnds` now includes `mtrx[1][m + 1]`.**
