The value of `i1` is assigned the result of the expression `False or 0`. The logical operation `or` evaluates to the first truthy value it encounters; since both `False` and `0` are considered falsy in Python, the result of `False or 0` is `0`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `c`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour; `i1` is 0**
