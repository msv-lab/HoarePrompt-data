Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than `j`, and `i` is 0. If `i - 1 > 0` evaluates to true, an element is added to `frnds` from `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, which accesses the element at index `-1` of the first row of `mtrx`. If `i - 1` is not greater than 0, there is no effect on `frnds`.***
