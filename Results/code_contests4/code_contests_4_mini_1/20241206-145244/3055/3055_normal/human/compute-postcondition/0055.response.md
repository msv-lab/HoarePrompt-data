The code adds the element at `mtrx[i - 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. Since `i` is greater than 1, `i - 1` is valid and points to a valid index in `mtrx`. The previous values of `j` and `m` do not affect this operation, and we know that the element at `mtrx[i][j]` is `c`, which is not equal to '.'. However, the exact value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is unspecified in the initial state. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that the element has been added without specifying its value.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the element at `mtrx[i - 1][j]` has been added to `frnds`.**
