According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0, as the `range(m)` function will not iterate if `m` is 0. The values of `k`, `j`, and `i` do not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute, apart from the fact that `j` will be updated during the loop iterations. 

At the start of the loop, `k` is equal to `n`, which does not impact the loop's execution condition. However, `j` is initialized to `m`, which is unnecessary since `j` will be set to the first value in the range on the first iteration. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0. As `j` is initialized before the loop and will be modified in the loop, we can set `j` to 0, which is the first value the loop will assign to it during execution.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0**
