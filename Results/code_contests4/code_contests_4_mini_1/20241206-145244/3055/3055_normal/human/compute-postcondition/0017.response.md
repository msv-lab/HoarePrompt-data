According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than the current value of `j`. 

Since `j` is currently less than `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is indeed greater than the current value of `j`. Therefore, to make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `m` is greater than the new value of `j`. 

State: **`n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `col` is a string input from raw_input(), `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[j]`, `j` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than `j`.**
