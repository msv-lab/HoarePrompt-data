Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, and `frnds` contains elements from `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, and `mtrx[i][j + 1]` if the corresponding conditions are met for all `j` in the range of `m`, while `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'; otherwise, `frnds` remains unchanged.**
