The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])` adds the element located at `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 0, and since `i + 1` is less than `n`, we can access the element at `mtrx[1][j]`. The values of `k`, `j`, `m`, and the contents of `mtrx` are not directly affected by this operation, but the `frnds` set will now include the element at the specified location.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and is not equal to '.', `frnds` now includes the element at `mtrx[1][j]`.**
