The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(k[i1])`, meaning it takes the integer value from the list `k` at index `i1` (which is 0). The variable `m` is assigned the value of `int(k[ii])`, meaning it takes the integer value from the list `k` at index `ii` (which is 1). The variable `c` is assigned the value of `k[iii]`, meaning it takes the value from the list `k` at index `iii` (which is 2). The values of `n`, `m`, and `c` are now dependent on the values present in the list `k`.

Therefore, the output state reflects these assignments. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value from `k[1]`, `c` is the character value from `k[2]`**.
