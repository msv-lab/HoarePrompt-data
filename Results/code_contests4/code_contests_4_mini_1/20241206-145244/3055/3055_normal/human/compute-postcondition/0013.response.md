The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `col`, and `mtrx[k]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `col` is a string input from raw_input(), `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[j]`, and `j` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `col` is a string input from raw_input(), `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[j]`, and `j` is increased by 1.**
