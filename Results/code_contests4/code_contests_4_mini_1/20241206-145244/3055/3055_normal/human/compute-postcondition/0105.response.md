The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i - 1][j])` attempts to add the value from the matrix `mtrx` at the position `[i - 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. The variable `i` is 1, so `i - 1` equals 0. The value of `j` is equal to `m`. Since we have no information about the matrix `mtrx` or its contents, we cannot determine the exact value being added to `frnds`. However, the execution of this line does not affect the values of `k`, `j`, `m`, or `i`.

The output state will simply reflect that `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, indicating that the loop would not execute a second time due to the condition stated.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the value from mtrx[0][j] has been added to frnds.**
