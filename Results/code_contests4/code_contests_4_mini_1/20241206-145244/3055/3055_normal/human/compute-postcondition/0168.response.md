Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a character `c`, representing the dimensions of a grid and a desk color respectively. It processes the grid to find all unique desk colors adjacent to the cells containing `c`, excluding empty cells represented by '.'. The function then prints the count of these unique colors. However, it does not return any value, only prints the result.**
