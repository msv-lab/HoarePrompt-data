The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `m` and `mtrx[k]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 1; `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[1]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 1; `mtrx[k]` is extended with `col[1]**
