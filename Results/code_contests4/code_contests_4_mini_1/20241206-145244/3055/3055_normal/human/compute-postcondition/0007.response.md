The code assigns the value of `int(False)` to `k`. Since `False` is equivalent to 0 when converted to an integer, `k` is now 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, or `frnds`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value from `k[1]`, `c` is the character value from `k[2]`, `mtrx` is a list of `n` empty lists, `frnds` is an empty set, and `k` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value from `k[1]`, `c` is the character value from `k[2]`, `mtrx` is a list of `n` empty lists, `frnds` is an empty set, `k` is 0**
