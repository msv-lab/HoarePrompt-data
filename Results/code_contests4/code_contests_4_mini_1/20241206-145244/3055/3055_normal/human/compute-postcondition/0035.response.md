The value of `k` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The states of `j` and `m` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0; `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0; `k` is increased by 1**
