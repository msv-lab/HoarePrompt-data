The code initializes `frnds` as an empty set. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`) remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `c`, and `mtrx`, along with the newly created empty set `frnds`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value from `k[1]`, `c` is the character value from `k[2]`, `mtrx` is a list of `n` empty lists, `frnds` is an empty set**.
