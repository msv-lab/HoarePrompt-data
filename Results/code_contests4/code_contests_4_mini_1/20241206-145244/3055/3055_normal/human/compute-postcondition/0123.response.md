Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', and if `i + 1` is less than `n`, then `frnds` now includes the value from `mtrx[2][m]`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` is not less than `n`, `frnds` remains unchanged.***
