The variable `iii` is assigned the value of `False or 2`. The expression `False or 2` evaluates to `2` because in Python, the `or` operator returns the first truthy value it encounters, and `2` is truthy. The previous values of the other variables `n`, `m`, `c`, `i1`, and `ii` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; `c` is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour; `i1` is 0; `ii` is 1; `iii` is 2.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; `c` is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour; `i1` is 0; `ii` is 1; `iii` is 2**
