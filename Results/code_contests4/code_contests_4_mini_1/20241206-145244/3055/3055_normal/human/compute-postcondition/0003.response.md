The variable `k` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split(' ')`, which means that `k` will be a list containing elements that are input as a space-separated string. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `c`, `i1`, `ii`, and `iii` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; `c` is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour; `i1` is 0; `ii` is 1; `iii` is 2; `k` is a list containing space-separated input values.
