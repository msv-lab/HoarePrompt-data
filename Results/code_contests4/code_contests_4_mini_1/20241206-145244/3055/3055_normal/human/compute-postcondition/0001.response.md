The variable `ii` is assigned the value of `False or 1`. In Python, the expression `False or 1` evaluates to `1` because the logical `or` operator returns the first truthy value it encounters. Therefore, `ii` is now `1`. The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `c`, and `i1` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; `c` is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour; `i1` is 0; `ii` is 1**
