According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is equal to `k`, which is also equal to `n`. This means `i` must be incremented to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
