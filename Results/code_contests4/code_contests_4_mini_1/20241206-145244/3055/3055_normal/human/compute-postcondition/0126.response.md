According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. In order for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. Given the current state, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, which means the loop can execute if `m` is at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, `j` is equal to `m`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will increment by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should start at 0 (the initial value of `j` before the loop starts). 

To summarize, for the loop to execute properly:
1. `m` must be greater than 0.
2. `j` should start at 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
