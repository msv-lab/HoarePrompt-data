According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. Right before the loop, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute at least the first time, `m` must be greater than 0 because if `m` is 0, then `j` (which is 0) would not be less than `m`, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `m` must be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
