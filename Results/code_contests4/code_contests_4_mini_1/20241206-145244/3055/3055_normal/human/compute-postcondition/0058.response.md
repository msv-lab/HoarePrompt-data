The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])` adds the element at `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. The initial state indicates that `j` is greater than 0, which means `j - 1` is non-negative and valid for indexing `mtrx`. The other variables' states remain unchanged after this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and is not equal to '.', and the element at `mtrx[i][j - 1]` has been added to `frnds`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and is not equal to '.', the element at `mtrx[i][j - 1]` has been added to `frnds`.**
