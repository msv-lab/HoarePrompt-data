To analyze the code snippet, we need to understand the initial state and the impact of the provided line on the variables.

Initial State: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```
frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])
```

Now, let's break it down:
1. `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2.
2. `j` is equal to `m`.
3. The value being added to `frnds` is `mtrx[2][j]`, where `j` is `m`.

Since `m` is greater than 0 and `i`, `j` are defined in terms of `m`, we can conclude that the state of `frnds` will now include the value from `mtrx[2][m]`.

The other variables (`k`, `j`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged, as the operation affects only the `frnds` variable.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `frnds` includes `mtrx[2][m]`.**
