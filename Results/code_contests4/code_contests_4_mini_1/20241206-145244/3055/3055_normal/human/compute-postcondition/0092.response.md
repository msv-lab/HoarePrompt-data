The code adds the value from `mtrx[i - 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `i - 1` is 0. Therefore, the value being added is `mtrx[0][j]`. Since `j` is equal to `m` and `m` is greater than 0, `j` is valid for accessing `mtrx`. The value `mtrx[1][j]` is `c` and is not equal to '.', but it does not affect the current operation. The output state reflects the addition operation but does not change the values of `k`, `j`, `m`, or `i`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `i - 1` is greater than 0; value `mtrx[0][j]` added to `frnds`.**
