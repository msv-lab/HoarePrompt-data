The variable `frnds` is modified by adding the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to it. The values of `k`, `j`, `m`, and `i` do not change as this operation only affects `frnds`. The previous states of `k`, `j`, `m`, and `i` are still applicable. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `frnds` now includes the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `frnds` now includes the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.**
