The code adds the value from `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. The value of `i` is 1 and `j` is equal to `m`, which is greater than 0. Thus, `j + 1` will be greater than `j`, and we are accessing `mtrx[1][m + 1]`. The value of `frnds` is modified to include this new element. The states of `k`, `j`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `frnds` includes `mtrx[1][m + 1]`.**
