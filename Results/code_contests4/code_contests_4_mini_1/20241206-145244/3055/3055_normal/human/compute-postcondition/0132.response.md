The code adds the element at position `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. The previous state indicates that `j - 1` is greater than 0, which means the position `j - 1` is valid and can be accessed in the matrix. The other variables `k`, `n`, `j`, `m`, `c`, and the conditions described do not directly change as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, the element at position `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, the element at position `mtrx[i][j]` is not equal to '.', `frnds` now includes the element `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, and `j - 1` is greater than 0.**
