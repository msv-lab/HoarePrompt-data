The code adds the element at `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. Since `j + 1` is less than `m`, the element at `mtrx[i][j + 1]` is valid and will be added. The values of `k`, `j`, `m`, `i`, and the element at `mtrx[i][j]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and is not equal to '.', and the element at `mtrx[i][j + 1]` has been added to `frnds`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and is not equal to '.', and the element at `mtrx[i][j + 1]` has been added to `frnds`.**
