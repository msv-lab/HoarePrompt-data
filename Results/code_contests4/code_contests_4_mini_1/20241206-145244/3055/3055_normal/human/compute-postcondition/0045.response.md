According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `m` is currently greater than 1 (as noted in the state description). Since `j` is 2 and `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust `m` to ensure it is greater than 2.

State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2**
