Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 2. If `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', and if `i + 1` is less than `n`, `frnds` is updated to include the value from `mtrx[i + 1][2]`. If `i + 1` is not less than `n`, no updates are made to `frnds.***
