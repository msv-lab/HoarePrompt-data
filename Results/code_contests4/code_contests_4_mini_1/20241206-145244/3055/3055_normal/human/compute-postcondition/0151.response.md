According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 1. Given that `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 2**.
