The value of `k` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` remains greater than or equal to 0, and `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` remains greater than or equal to 0, and `k` is increased by 1**
