According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates for each value of `j` from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than 0, and since `m` is greater than `j`, the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`. Therefore, if `j` is currently `k` (where `k` is greater than 0), the next value of `j` would be `k + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`, which means `j` should be `k + 1` and `j` must satisfy the condition that `k + 1` is less than `m`.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a next time `m` must be greater than `k + 1`**
