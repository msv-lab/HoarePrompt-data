The code `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` extends the list at index `k` of `mtrx` by appending elements from the list at index `j` of `col`. The value of `j` is 2, but we do not know the contents of `col` or the current state of `mtrx`. The variable `m` is stated to be greater than 1, but its specific value does not affect the operation of this line of code.

Since `mtrx[k]` will have elements added to it from `col[2]`, we can say that the content of `mtrx[k]` will change, but we cannot determine the exact output without knowing the values in `col` or `mtrx`. The impact of the code does not affect `j` or `m` directly in terms of their values, only the contents of `mtrx`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2; `m` is greater than 1; and `mtrx[k]` is updated by extending it with elements from `col[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `m` is greater than 1; and `mtrx[k]` is updated by extending it with elements from `col[2]**.
