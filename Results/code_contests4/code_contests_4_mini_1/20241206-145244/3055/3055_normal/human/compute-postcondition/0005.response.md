The code creates a list of empty lists called `mtrx`, where the number of empty lists is determined by the value of `n`. The variable `n` is the integer value from `k[0]`. The values of `m` and `c` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current situation of `n`, `m`, and `c`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from `k[0]`, `m` is the integer value from `k[1]`, `c` is the character value from `k[2]`, `mtrx` is a list of `n` empty lists.**
