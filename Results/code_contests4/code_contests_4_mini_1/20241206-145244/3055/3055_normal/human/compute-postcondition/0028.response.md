According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, since `j` is currently 1.

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 1**
