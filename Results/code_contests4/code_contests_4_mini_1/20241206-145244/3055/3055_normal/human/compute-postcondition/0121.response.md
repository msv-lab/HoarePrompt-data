To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to understand the implications of the initial state on the execution of the code.

1. The initial state mentions that `k` is equal to `n` and `j` is equal to `m`. It is also stated that `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1.
2. The condition provided suggests that if `j + 1` is less than `m`, we would update `frnds` to include a value from `mtrx[1][m + 1]`. However, we are only executing the code snippet provided, which is `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])`.
3. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is equal to `m`, the expression `mtrx[i + 1][j]` translates to `mtrx[2][m]`.
4. The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])` implies that we are adding the value from `mtrx[2][m]` to the set `frnds`.

Now, let's summarize the output state based on the information we have:

- The value of `frnds` is updated to include the value `mtrx[2][m]`, but we do not have specific values for `mtrx` or `frnds` before this operation.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `frnds` now includes the value from `mtrx[2][m]`.**
