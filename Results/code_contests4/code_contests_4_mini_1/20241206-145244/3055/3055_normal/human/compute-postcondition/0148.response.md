The code snippet adds `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. The initial state indicates that `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. Since `j + 1` (which equals 2) is less than `m`, we can assume `mtrx[i + 1][j]` can be accessed.

The values of `k`, `j`, and `m` do not change, but `frnds` is modified to include the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1; `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1; `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i + 1][j]**
