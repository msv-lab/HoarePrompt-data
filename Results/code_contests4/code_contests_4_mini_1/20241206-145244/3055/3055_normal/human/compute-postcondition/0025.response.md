According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop can execute if `j` is less than `m`. Right before the loop, `j` is 0 and `m` is not provided, but we know `m` is expected to be an integer. For the loop to execute at least one time, `m` must be greater than 0. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0. The value of `k` does not directly impact the execution of the loop. 

State: **`j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` must be greater than 0**
