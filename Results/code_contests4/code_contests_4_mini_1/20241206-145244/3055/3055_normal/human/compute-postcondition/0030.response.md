The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables, `m` and `mtrx[k]`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 1; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[j]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 1; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[j]`.**
