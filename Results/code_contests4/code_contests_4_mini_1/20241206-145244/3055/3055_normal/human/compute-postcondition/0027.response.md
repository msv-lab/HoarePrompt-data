`j` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `j` is 0, it will become 1. The values of `m` and `mtrx[k]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[0]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[0]**
