The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `j` was `m`, which is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` is now 0, while `m` remains unchanged. The other variables `n` and `col` are not affected, so their states remain the same. 

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, and `col` is an input string.**
