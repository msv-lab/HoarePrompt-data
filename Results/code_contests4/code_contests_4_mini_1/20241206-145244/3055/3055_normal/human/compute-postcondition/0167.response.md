The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its signature. However, it operates on the following input constraints: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, and the function processes `n` lines containing `m` characters each, where each character is either an uppercase Latin letter (representing a desk colour) or a period ('.') representing an empty cell. 

The function's output is not explicitly described in the prompt, so we cannot ascertain the exact return value based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a grid of characters representing desk colours and empty cells, based on the input constraints of integers n and m, and an uppercase letter c. The specific output or return value is not defined in the provided information.**
