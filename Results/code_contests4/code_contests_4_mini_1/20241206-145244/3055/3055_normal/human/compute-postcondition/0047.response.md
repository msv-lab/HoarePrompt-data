The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The values of `m` and `mtrx[k]` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3; `m` is greater than 1; `mtrx[k]` is updated by extending it with elements from `col[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 3; `m` is greater than 1; `mtrx[k]` is updated by extending it with elements from `col[2]**
