The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])` attempts to add an element from the `mtrx` matrix to the `frnds` set. The value of `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than 0, which means `j - 1` is a valid index. Therefore, the code accesses `mtrx[0][j - 1]` to retrieve the element to be added to `frnds`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified in detail, but we know that `frnds` will have an element added from `mtrx`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than `j`, `i` is 0; an element from `mtrx[0][j - 1]` is added to `frnds`.**
