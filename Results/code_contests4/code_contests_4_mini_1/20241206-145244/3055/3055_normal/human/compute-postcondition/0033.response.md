The variable `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The state of `m` and `mtrx[k]` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[2]**
