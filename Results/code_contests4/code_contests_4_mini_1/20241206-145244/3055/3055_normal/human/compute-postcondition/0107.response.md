The code attempts to add the value from `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is equal to `m`, the calculation will access `mtrx[1][m - 1]`. However, the initial state indicates that the if part does not execute due to the condition involving `i - 1`. Therefore, the value of `frnds` is modified by adding `mtrx[1][m - 1]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `frnds` has added `mtrx[1][m - 1]`**
