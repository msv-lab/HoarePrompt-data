According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 0, with the condition for the loop to execute again stating that `m` must be greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, since `j` is currently 2, `m` must be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 2 (because `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue). 

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than 2**
