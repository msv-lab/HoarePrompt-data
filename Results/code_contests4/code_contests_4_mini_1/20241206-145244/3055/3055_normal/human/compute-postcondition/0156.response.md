The code adds the value from `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. The previous value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3. The state of `frnds` changes based on the new value added, but the values of `k` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, and `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[i][3]`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, and `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[i][3]`**.
