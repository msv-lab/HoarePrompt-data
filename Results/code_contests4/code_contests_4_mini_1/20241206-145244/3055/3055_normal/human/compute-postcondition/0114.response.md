According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, which means the loop has completed its iteration and cannot execute again since the range for `j` is from `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

As `j` is currently equal to `m`, the loop cannot execute again because it would require `j` to be less than `m`. At this point, `k` is still equal to `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `frnds` remains unchanged. 

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `m`.**
