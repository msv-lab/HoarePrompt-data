According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than 0, which means it could be any value starting from 1 up to `m-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be equal to its current value plus 1, which is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than `j`, `i` is 0**
