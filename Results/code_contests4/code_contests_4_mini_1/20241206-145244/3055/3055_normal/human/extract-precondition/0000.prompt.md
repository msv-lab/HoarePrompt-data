You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: President of Berland has a very vast office-room, where, apart from him, work his subordinates. Each subordinate, as well as President himself, has his own desk of a unique colour. Each desk is rectangular, and its sides are parallel to the office walls. One day President decided to establish an assembly, of which all his deputies will be members. Unfortunately, he does not remember the exact amount of his deputies, but he remembers that the desk of each his deputy is adjacent to his own desk, that is to say, the two desks (President's and each deputy's) have a common side of a positive length.

The office-room plan can be viewed as a matrix with n rows and m columns. Each cell of this matrix is either empty, or contains a part of a desk. An uppercase Latin letter stands for each desk colour. The «period» character («.») stands for an empty cell. 

Input

The first line contains two separated by a space integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the length and the width of the office-room, and c character — the President's desk colour. The following n lines contain m characters each — the office-room description. It is guaranteed that the colour of each desk is unique, and each desk represents a continuous subrectangle of the given matrix. All colours are marked by uppercase Latin letters.

Output

Print the only number — the amount of President's deputies.
