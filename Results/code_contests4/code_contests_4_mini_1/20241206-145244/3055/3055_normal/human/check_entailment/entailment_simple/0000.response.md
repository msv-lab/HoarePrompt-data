The provided program is intended to count the number of deputies whose desks are adjacent to the President's desk in a given office-room matrix. However, there are some issues in the implementation that prevent it from fulfilling the requirements of the problem description correctly.

### Issues in the Implementation:

1. **Incorrect Index Check for Adjacency**:
   The program checks for adjacency using conditions like `if i - 1 > 0:`. This will incorrectly exclude the top row (i.e., when `i` is 0), as it should check `if i - 1 >= 0:` to include the first row in the adjacency check.

2. **Condition for Adding Adjacent Colors**:
   The program currently checks if `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, but it only checks for the President's desk color. It should be checking all cells adjacent to the President's desk and adding their colors to the set `frnds` without filtering out any colors. The condition should be based on the adjacent cells, not limited to the President's desk.

3. **Counting Adjacent Desks**:
   The program might end up counting the President's desk itself if it has adjacent cells incorrectly implemented. The logic should ensure it only counts unique adjacent desk colors that are not the President's desk color.

4. **Input Handling**:
   The use of `raw_input()` suggests that this code is written for Python 2. If this were to be executed in a Python 3 environment, it would raise an error as `raw_input()` is not defined. This is not a correctness issue per se, but it is important to note for compatibility.

### Conclusion:
Due to these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Specifically, it fails to properly identify the deputies' desks adjacent to the President's desk, potentially leading to incorrect counts.

Correctness: **False**
