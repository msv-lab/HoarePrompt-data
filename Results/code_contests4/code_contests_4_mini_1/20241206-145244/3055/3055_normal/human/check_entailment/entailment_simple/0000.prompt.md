You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: President of Berland has a very vast office-room, where, apart from him, work his subordinates. Each subordinate, as well as President himself, has his own desk of a unique colour. Each desk is rectangular, and its sides are parallel to the office walls. One day President decided to establish an assembly, of which all his deputies will be members. Unfortunately, he does not remember the exact amount of his deputies, but he remembers that the desk of each his deputy is adjacent to his own desk, that is to say, the two desks (President's and each deputy's) have a common side of a positive length.

The office-room plan can be viewed as a matrix with n rows and m columns. Each cell of this matrix is either empty, or contains a part of a desk. An uppercase Latin letter stands for each desk colour. The «period» character («.») stands for an empty cell. 

Input

The first line contains two separated by a space integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the length and the width of the office-room, and c character — the President's desk colour. The following n lines contain m characters each — the office-room description. It is guaranteed that the colour of each desk is unique, and each desk represents a continuous subrectangle of the given matrix. All colours are marked by uppercase Latin letters.

Output

Print the only number — the amount of President's deputies.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, c is an uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, and the following n lines contain m characters each, where each character is either an uppercase Latin letter representing a desk colour or a period ('.') representing an empty cell.
def func():
    i1 = False or 0
    ii = False or 1
    iii = False or 2
    k = raw_input().split(' ')
    n, m, c = int(k[i1]), int(k[ii]), k[iii]
    mtrx = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    frnds = set([])
    k = int(False)
    while k < n:
        col = raw_input()
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < m:
            mtrx[k].extend(col[j])
            j = j + 1
        
        k = k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `mtrx` contains `n` lists, each extended with the corresponding input strings from `raw_input()` for the first `m` characters.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if mtrx[i][j] == c and mtrx[i][j] != '.':
                if i - 1 > 0:
                    frnds.add(mtrx[i - 1][j])
                if j - 1 > 0:
                    frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])
                if j + 1 < m:
                    frnds.add(mtrx[i][j + 1])
                if i + 1 < n:
                    frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `frnds` contains all unique elements from `mtrx` that are adjacent to positions where `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', for all valid indices in the matrix.
    if ('.' in frnds) :
        frnds.remove('.')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`k` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `frnds` contains all unique elements from `mtrx` that are adjacent to positions where `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'; if '.' is present in `frnds`, it is removed from `frnds`.
    print(len(frnds))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
