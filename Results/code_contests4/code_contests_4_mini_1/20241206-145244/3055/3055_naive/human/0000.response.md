To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The program should count the number of unique colors of desks that are adjacent to the President's desk in a given office-room matrix. The inputs include the dimensions of the matrix, the color of the President's desk, and the matrix itself.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions and the President's desk color correctly.
2. **Matrix Construction**: It constructs the matrix from the input properly.
3. **Finding Adjacent Desks**:
   - The program iterates through the matrix to find the President's desk.
   - It checks the four possible adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) for colors of the desks.
   - It adds unique desk colors to a set.

### Potential Issues
1. **Indexing Errors**: The program checks `i - 1 > 0` and `j - 1 > 0`, which will skip the first row and first column entirely. The checks should be `i - 1 >= 0` and `j - 1 >= 0` to include the first row and column.
2. **Handling Empty Cells**: The program checks if `'.'` is in `frnds` and removes it. However, this check is unnecessary since the program should only add non-empty desk colors.
3. **Counting the Correctly Adjacent Desks**: If the President's desk is on an edge or in a corner, the program might produce incorrect results due to the indexing issue mentioned.

### Example of Failure
Consider the input:
```
2 2 A
A.
.B
```
- The expected output is `1` since desk `B` is adjacent to desk `A`.
- The program would not check `i - 1` for the first row, potentially missing desk `B` and incorrectly returning `0`.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the indexing error that leads to missing adjacent desks in certain configurations.

Correctness: **False**.
