`days` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of other variables (`len(arr)`, `j`, and the elements at indices `i` and `j` of `arr`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is 1, `len(arr)` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is greater than the element at index `j` of `arr`.

Output State: **`days` is 1, `len(arr)` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is greater than the element at index `j` of `arr`.**
