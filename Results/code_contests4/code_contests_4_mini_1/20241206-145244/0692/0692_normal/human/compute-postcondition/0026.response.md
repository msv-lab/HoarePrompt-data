According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j` and it executes as long as `j` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is set to 2, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. This means `j` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. 

The loop will continue executing if `j` is less than `len(arr)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(arr)` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`days` is the count of elements in `arr` that are less than `arr[i]` plus 1 if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, and `days` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `len(arr)` must be greater than 3, `j` is 3.**
