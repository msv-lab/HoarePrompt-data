According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. The loop will execute if `len(arr) - 1` is at least 1, which means `len(arr)` must be at least 2. Since `days` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution, it remains unchanged. The loop variable `i` must start at 0 for the loop to execute for the first time. 

State: **`days` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `len(arr)` is at least 2, `i` is 0**
