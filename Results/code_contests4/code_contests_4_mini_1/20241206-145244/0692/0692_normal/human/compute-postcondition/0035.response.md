The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is now the previous value of `days` plus 1; `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`; `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`; `len(arr)` is greater than or equal to 2; `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
