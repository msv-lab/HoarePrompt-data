According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `len(arr)`. However, since the loop condition is `j` must be less than `len(arr)`, it cannot execute again.

Thus, the loop cannot execute again, and the state remains unchanged because `j` has reached the value that is not valid for continuation of the loop.

State: **`days` is the count of elements in `arr` less than `arr[i]`, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, and `len(arr)` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**
