Postcondition: ***`days` is the count of elements in `arr` less than `arr[i]`, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, and `len(arr)` is greater than or equal to 2. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, then `days` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
