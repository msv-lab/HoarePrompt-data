According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`, which is iterating over the range of indices of the array `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `days` is the count of elements in `arr` that are less than `arr[i]` plus 1, under certain conditions. Since `j` starts at 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2, which ensures that the loop will iterate over the next index of `arr`.

State: **`days` is the count of elements in `arr` that are less than `arr[i]` plus 1, if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `days` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2.**
