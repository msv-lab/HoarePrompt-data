Postcondition: ***`days` is the count of elements in `arr` less than `arr[i]`, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, and `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, then `days` is incremented by 1, `j` remains equal to `len(arr) - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
