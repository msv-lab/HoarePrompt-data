The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) representing the number of days, and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the prices of the berPhone on those days. The function processes this input to produce a result based on the prices across the specified days for each test case. The exact output is not specified, but it is implied that the function computes some value or values based on the prices provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples containing integers and lists of integers, and to return a computed result based on the prices of the berPhone over the specified days. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of tuples containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing prices. It processes this input and returns a computed result based on the prices.**
