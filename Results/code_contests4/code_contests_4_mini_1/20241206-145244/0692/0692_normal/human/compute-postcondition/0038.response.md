The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is not specified but is the count of elements in `arr` that are less than `arr[i]`. Other variables `j` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`.

Output State: **`days` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1**
