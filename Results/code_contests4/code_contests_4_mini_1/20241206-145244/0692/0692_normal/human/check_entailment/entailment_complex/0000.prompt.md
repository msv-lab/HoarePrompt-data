You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n last days: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the price of berPhone on the day i.

Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6 and a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], then the number of days with a bad price is 3 — these are days 2 (a_2=9), 4 (a_4=6) and 5 (a_5=7).

Print the number of days with a bad price.

You have to answer t independent data sets.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of sets of input data in the test. Input data sets must be processed independently, one after another.

Each input data set consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of days. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), where a_i is the price on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all data sets in the test does not exceed 150000.

Output

Print t integers, the j-th of which should be equal to the number of days with a bad price in the j-th input data set.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) representing the number of days, and a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the prices of the berPhone on those days. The total number of days across all test cases does not exceed 150000.
def func_1(arr):
    days = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                days += 1
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is the count of elements in `arr` that are less than each of the elements in `arr` (excluding the last element), `len(arr)` is at least 2, and `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing prices. It computes the number of days where the price on a given day is greater than at least one previous day. However, the implementation has issues: it does not correctly iterate over the prices per each tuple and the logic for counting days is flawed, leading to a likely incorrect result. The function currently attempts to compare prices incorrectly and does not return any value, which is missing functionality.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
