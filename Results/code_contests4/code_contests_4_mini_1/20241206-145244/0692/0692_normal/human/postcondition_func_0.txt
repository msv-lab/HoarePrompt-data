The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing prices. It computes the number of days where the price on a given day is greater than at least one previous day. However, the implementation has issues: it does not correctly iterate over the prices per each tuple and the logic for counting days is flawed, leading to a likely incorrect result. The function currently attempts to compare prices incorrectly and does not return any value, which is missing functionality.
