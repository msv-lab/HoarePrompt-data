#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) representing the number of days, and a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the prices of the berPhone on those days. The total number of days across all test cases does not exceed 150000.
def func_1(arr):
    days = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                days += 1
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is the count of elements in `arr` that are less than each of the elements in `arr` (excluding the last element), `len(arr)` is at least 2, and `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing prices. It computes the number of days where the price on a given day is greater than at least one previous day. However, the implementation has issues: it does not correctly iterate over the prices per each tuple and the logic for counting days is flawed, leading to a likely incorrect result. The function currently attempts to compare prices incorrectly and does not return any value, which is missing functionality.
