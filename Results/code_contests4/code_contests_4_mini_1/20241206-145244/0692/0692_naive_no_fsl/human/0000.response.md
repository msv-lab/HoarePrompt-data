To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to count the number of "bad price" days for a series of price lists. A price on day `i` is considered bad if there exists a later day `j` (where `j > i`) such that the price on day `j` is lower than the price on day `i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(arr)` initializes `days` to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over each day `i` (from 0 to `len(arr) - 2`), and the inner loop iterates from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - Inside the inner loop, it checks if the price on day `i` is greater than the price on day `j`. If so, it increments the `days` counter and breaks out of the inner loop.

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The inner loop starts from index 1, which means it does not check the prices after day `i` but rather checks against all earlier days and misses the necessary comparisons against later days.
   - This logic is flawed because the condition of "later days" is not satisfied. The program does not correctly identify whether a price on day `i` is bad based on the prices of days `j` that come after day `i`.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
10 20 30 40 15
```
- Here, the price on day 1 (20) is bad because day 5 (15) is lower.
- The price on day 2 (30) is also bad because day 5 (15) is lower.
- The price on day 3 (40) is also bad because day 5 (15) is lower.
- The expected output is 3, but the program will not correctly identify these as bad prices due to the incorrect inner loop indexing.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect implementation of the logic to find bad price days, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements. 

Correctness: **False**
