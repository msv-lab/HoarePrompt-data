The provided program aims to count the number of days with a bad price for the berPhone based on the conditions described. However, upon analyzing the program, it is evident that it does not correctly implement the logic as specified in the problem description.

1. **Logic Flaw**: The nested loops in the `func_1` function incorrectly check for bad prices. The outer loop iterates over each day's price `arr[i]`, and the inner loop checks all subsequent days' prices `arr[j]` (starting from index 1). This does not accurately reflect the requirement to compare `arr[i]` with prices that come later in the list, specifically starting from `arr[i+1]` up to the end of the list.

2. **Incorrect Counting**: The program does not count all bad prices correctly. For each `arr[i]`, it should check if there exists any `arr[j]` where `j > i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`. The current logic will not do this correctly since it starts the inner loop from index 1 for each outer loop iteration, which can lead to incorrect counting and skipped checks.

3. **Improper Return Value**: The function `func_1` counts the bad prices but does not return the count, which is necessary to provide the required output.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
1
6
3 9 4 6 7 5
```
The expected output is 3 (for days 2, 4, and 5). However, the logic in `func_1` would not correctly identify these since it improperly checks all past prices instead of just the future ones.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
