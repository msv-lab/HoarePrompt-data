`count` is assigned the value of `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n >= 2`. The value of `n` is reassigned from `int(raw_input())`, thus `count` will take on the new integer value of `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now the new integer input and `count` is equal to this new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer input; `count` is equal to the new value of `n`**
