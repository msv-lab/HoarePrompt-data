The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a positive integer `n` that is at least 2, though it is not passed as an argument to the function. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on an internal positive integer `n` that meets the specified constraint.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a positive integer n that is greater than or equal to 2, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
