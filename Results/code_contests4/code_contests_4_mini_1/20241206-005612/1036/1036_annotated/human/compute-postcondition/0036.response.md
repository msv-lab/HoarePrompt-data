The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is updated by adding `b`, `n` is decremented by `b`, where `b` is `n // i`, and `b` is equal to 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
