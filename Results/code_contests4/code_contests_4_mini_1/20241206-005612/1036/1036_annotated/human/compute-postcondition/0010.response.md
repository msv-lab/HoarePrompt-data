According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 4, and the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 4.

State: **`count` is equal to `n`, where `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 4**.
