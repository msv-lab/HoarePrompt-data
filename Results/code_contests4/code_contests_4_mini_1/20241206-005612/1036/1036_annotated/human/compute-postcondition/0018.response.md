The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `n`, `i` is either equal to `n` or a divisor of `n`, `n` is either `n - 1` or `n - b`, and `b` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
