The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` has been updated by adding `b`, where `b` equals 1; `n` has been decreased by 1; `i` is the first number in the range [2, n) that divides `n` if it exists, otherwise `i` is `n`; `b` is equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
