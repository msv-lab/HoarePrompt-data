The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer `n` from input (where `n >= 2`). It computes a value `count` by iteratively reducing `n` based on its divisors until `n` equals 1. During each iteration, it adds the quotient of `n` divided by the smallest divisor found to `count`. Finally, it prints the value of `count`. The function will effectively accumulate values based on the divisors of `n`, and it will terminate when `n` becomes 1.
