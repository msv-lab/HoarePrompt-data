Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The main issue lies in how the program determines the next number of pebbles after each move. According to the problem, the Smart Beaver must select a divisor `b` such that `n = a * b` for some `a > 1`. However, the code incorrectly identifies the smallest divisor `i` in the for loop and uses it directly to calculate `b`. This can lead to incorrect behavior in cases where `n` has divisors that do not maximize the sum of the sequence `c`.

For instance, consider the input `n = 10`. The correct sequence of moves according to the problem description should yield the maximum sum of `16`. However, the logic in the program might prematurely decrease `n` by selecting suboptimal divisors because it only considers the smallest divisor in the range `[2, n)` rather than exploring all possible valid configurations that could yield a higher sum.

Additionally, the program does not account for the requirement that `b` must be greater than or equal to `2`, as per the restriction that `a > 1` implies `b` must also be greater than `1`. The program's loop can potentially terminate early or yield incorrect values if `b` has not been chosen optimally.

As a specific counterexample, if we take `n = 8`, the program may not explore all valid configurations and thus might not yield the maximum sum of `15`, which is correct according to the problem statement. Instead, it might end up with a lesser total due to its flawed divisor selection mechanism.

In summary, the algorithm fails to explore all potential divisor combinations to maximize the sum `c1 + c2 + ... + ck`, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
