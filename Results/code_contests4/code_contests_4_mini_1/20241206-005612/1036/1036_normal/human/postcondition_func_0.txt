The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for an integer input `n` (expected to be greater than or equal to 2). It then calculates a value `count`, which is the sum of the results of dividing `n` by its smallest divisor (greater than 1) until `n` becomes 1. The function prints the final value of `count`. If `n` is not a prime number, the loop continues until `n` is reduced to 1, accumulating the results of the divisions. However, if `n` is prime, the loop will break earlier once `b` equals 1. The function does not specify any output other than printing the `count`.
