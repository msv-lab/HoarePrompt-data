The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate based on the previously established constraint that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. However, since the function definition does not include any parameters, the functionality regarding the constraint of `n` cannot be directly applied to the function's input. Therefore, the specific output behavior of the function is not defined in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a defined output based on the provided constraints.**
