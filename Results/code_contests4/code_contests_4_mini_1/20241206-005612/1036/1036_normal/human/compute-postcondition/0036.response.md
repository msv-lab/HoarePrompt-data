The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is less than or equal to `n - b`, `i` remains the same, `b` is defined as `n // i`, `count` is increased by `b`, and `b` is equal to 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
