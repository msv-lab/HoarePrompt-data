According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` remains less than `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3**
