According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3**
