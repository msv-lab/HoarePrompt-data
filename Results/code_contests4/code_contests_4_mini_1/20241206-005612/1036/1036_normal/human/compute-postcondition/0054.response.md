The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is either undefined or the first integer from 2 to `n-1` that divides `n`, or `n-1`; `b` is equal to 1; `count` is increased by 1; `n` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
