The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is initially an integer greater than or equal to 2, its value will be replaced by the new input integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer**
