According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 1. Right before the loop, `n` is a new input integer and `count` is the same as `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be any integer other than 1. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to be either less than or greater than 1 (but not equal to 1).

State: **`n` is any integer other than 1, `count` is the same as `n`**
