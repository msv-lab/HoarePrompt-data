According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is updated to `n - (n // i)`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 after the update. 

For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that the result of `n - (n // i)` does not equal 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 (because if `n` were 2 and `i` were 1, then `n` would be updated to 1). 

Thus, the conditions that need to be adjusted are that `n` should remain greater than 1.

State: **`n` is updated to `n - (n // i)` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1**
