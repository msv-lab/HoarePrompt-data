The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but causes an immediate exit from the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. In this scenario, since `n` is at least 3, `count` is the same as `n`, and `i` is 3, the execution of the `break` statement means we exit the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `count` is the same as `n`, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `count` is the same as `n`, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
