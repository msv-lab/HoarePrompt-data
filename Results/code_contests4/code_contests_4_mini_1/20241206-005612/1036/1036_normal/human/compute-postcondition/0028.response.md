According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n`. The current value of `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3, which means the loop can execute again. If `i` is increased by 1, it becomes 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 4**
