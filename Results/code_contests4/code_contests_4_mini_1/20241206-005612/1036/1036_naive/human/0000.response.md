To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

Problem description requires the Smart Beaver to arrange n pebbles into rows of b pebbles (where a > 1) until he ends up with exactly one pebble, and the goal is to maximize the sum of all pebbles used in each configuration.

The provided program is as follows:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
count = n
while n != 1:
    for i in range(2, n):
        if divmod(n, i)[1] == 0:
            break
    b = n // i
    count += b
    n -= b
    if b == 1:
        break
print(count)
```

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `count` is initialized with the value of `n`, which is correct since the first move uses all pebbles.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `n` becomes 1, which is necessary.

3. **Finding Divisors**: The inner loop finds the first divisor `i` of `n` that is greater than or equal to 2. However, it breaks as soon as it finds the first divisor. This means it does not explore all possible arrangements that could lead to a higher sum.

4. **Calculating b**: The value of `b` is calculated as `n // i`, which is correct. This represents the number of pebbles in each row after choosing `i` rows.

5. **Updating Count**: The program updates `count` by adding `b`, which is correct.

6. **Updating `n`**: The program then reduces `n` by `b`, which is also correct.

7. **Breaking Condition**: The program includes a condition to break if `b` becomes 1, which is unnecessary because the loop already terminates when `n` becomes 1.

### Potential Failure Case:

The main issue is that the algorithm only considers the first divisor found, which might not yield the maximum possible sum. For example, consider `n = 12`. The divisors of 12 are 2, 3, 4, and 6. The program would potentially choose 2 as the first divisor, leading to:
- First move: 12 -> 6 (count = 12 + 6 = 18)
- Second move: 6 -> 3 (count = 18 + 3 = 21)
- Third move: 3 -> 1 (count = 21 + 1 = 22)

However, had the program chosen 3 as the divisor first, it would have achieved:
- First move: 12 -> 4 (count = 12 + 4 = 16)
- Second move: 4 -> 2 (count = 16 + 2 = 18)
- Third move: 2 -> 1 (count = 18 + 1 = 19)
  
A more optimal path could yield a different outcome, thus the program fails to explore all possibilities, leading to a suboptimal result.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program does not explore all possible divisor combinations to maximize the sum and could provide incorrect results for certain inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
