According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 3 and will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4**
