The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` has been increased by `1`, where `b` is equal to `1`, and `n` is decreased by `1`. Additionally, `b` is equal to `n // i` before entering the if condition, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
