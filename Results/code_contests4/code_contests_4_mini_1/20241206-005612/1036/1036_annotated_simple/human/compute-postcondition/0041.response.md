The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and the remainder of the division of `n` by `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
