According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 (since the range starts at 2) and `n` is a positive integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
