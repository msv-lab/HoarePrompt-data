According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `n >= 1`, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2, because `range(2, n)` produces an iterable starting from 2 up to but not including `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 2. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i` will start at 2, as it is the first value in the range. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
