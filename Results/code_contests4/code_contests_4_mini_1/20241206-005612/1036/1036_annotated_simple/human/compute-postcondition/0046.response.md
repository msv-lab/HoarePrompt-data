According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 2 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 4 for the next iteration. 

Furthermore, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since there are no changes to `count` or `i` if `n` is not divisible by `i`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`count` is increased by 1, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 4**
