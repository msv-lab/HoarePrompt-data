The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `b`, where `b` is the value of `n // i`; `n` is decreased by `b`; and `b` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
