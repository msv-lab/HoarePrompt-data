The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a positive integer `n`, which is defined as being greater than or equal to 2. However, since no such parameter is passed to the function explicitly, we cannot detail specific outputs based on varying input values. 

Based on the provided constraints, we can conclude that the function will perform operations that involve the integer `n`, but since it takes no parameters, its output cannot be directly inferred from an external input. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined without additional information about what operations are performed or what outputs are generated based on the internal handling of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and is designed to work with a positive integer n that is greater than or equal to 2, but cannot directly return a value based on input as it takes no inputs.**
