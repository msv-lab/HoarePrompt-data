The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 2`, `count` is assigned the value of `n + b`, `i` is either `n - 1` (if `n` is prime) or the smallest divisor of `n` (if `n` is not prime); since `b` is equal to 1, `n` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
