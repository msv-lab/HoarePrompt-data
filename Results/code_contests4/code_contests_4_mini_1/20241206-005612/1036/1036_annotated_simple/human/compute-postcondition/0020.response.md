According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop continues as long as `n` is not equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is at least 1, it needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1**
