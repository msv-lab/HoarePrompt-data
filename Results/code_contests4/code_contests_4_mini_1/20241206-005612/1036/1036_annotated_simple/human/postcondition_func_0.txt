The function accepts a positive integer `n` (via user input) that must be at least 2 and calculates the sum of `n // i` for the largest divisor `i` of `n` (starting from 2) in each iteration until `n` reduces to 1. It prints the final sum, which is stored in `count`. The function does not explicitly return any value, as it only prints the result.
