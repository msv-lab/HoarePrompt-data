The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input, which is correct as per the problem description.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the integers in descending order. This is appropriate for ensuring that the largest integer is used as the first operand in the equation.
3. **Calculation**: The program calculates the allowance using the formula:
   ```
   ans = 10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]
   ```
   This formula effectively creates a two-digit number by placing the largest integer at the tens place and adding the other two integers as units. 

### Comparison with Problem Description:
The problem states that the allowance is calculated based on the formula `X + Y`, where `X` and `Y` are formed by arranging the digits. The program only computes the allowance as a single two-digit number formed by the digits rather than two distinct components that are summed (as `X` and `Y`).

### Example Cases:
- **Input**: `1 5 2`
  - Possible combinations: `5 + 12` (which is 17), `12 + 5` (which is 17), `15 + 2` (which is 17), etc.
  - Program output: `53` (incorrect).
  
- **Input**: `9 9 9`
  - Possible combinations: `99 + 9` (which is 108).
  - Program output: `108` (correct for this case, but not generally applicable).
  
- **Input**: `6 6 7`
  - Possible combinations: `76 + 6` (which is 82).
  - Program output: `82` (correct for this case, but not generally applicable).

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for all possible combinations of digits to form `X` and `Y` according to the rules. Instead, it only computes a single interpretation of the digits, which fails to cover all valid configurations.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
