The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The output of the function is based on the values of the integers A, B, and C, which must satisfy the condition that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9. The specific return values are not provided in the output description. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact functionality based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is based on the internal logic involving integers A, B, and C, constrained to the range of 1 to 9.**
