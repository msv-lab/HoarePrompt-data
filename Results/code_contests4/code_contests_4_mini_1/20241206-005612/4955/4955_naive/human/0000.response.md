To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code:

### Problem Description:
The task is to compute the maximum allowance based on three integer panels (A, B, C), each containing a digit between 1 and 9, and one operator panel with a `+`. The formula constructed should be of the form X + Y, where we need to find the maximum possible value of this expression.

### Program:
```python
lst = raw_input().split()
lst.sort()
lst.reverse()
lst = list(map(int, lst))
ans = 10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input as a single line and splits it into a list of strings, which is then sorted in reverse order. It converts the strings to integers.

2. **Logic for Maximum Allowance**: 
   - After sorting and reversing, the first element (`lst[0]`) is the largest digit.
   - The resulting allowance is calculated as `10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]`. This represents placing the largest digit in the tens place and summing the other two digits.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The maximum value of X + Y can be constructed in various ways. 
   - For example, with input `1 5 2`, possible combinations are:
     - 5 + 12 = 17
     - 2 + 51 = 53 (the maximum)
     - 1 + 52 = 53 (the maximum)
   - The program correctly identifies that the combination resulting in `53` is the maximum.
   - However, with input `6 6 7`, the program evaluates as follows:
     - The combinations are:
       - 7 + 66 = 73
       - 6 + 67 = 73 (the maximum)
       - 6 + 76 = 82 (the maximum)
     - The program incorrectly calculates as `10 * 7 + 6 + 6 = 82`, which is valid but does not consider all placements of the numbers.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - For input `6 6 7`, the maximum allowance should be `76` (6 + 76), but the program's logic results in `82`, which is incorrect as it does not yield the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program does not handle all combinations of the digits effectively to ensure the maximum allowance is calculated correctly for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
