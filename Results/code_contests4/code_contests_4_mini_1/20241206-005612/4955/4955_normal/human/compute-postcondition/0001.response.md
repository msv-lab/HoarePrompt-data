The code `lst.sort()` sorts the list of strings `lst` in ascending order. The values of the integers `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged, as this operation solely affects the list. Therefore, the output state includes the original values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, along with the sorted state of `lst`.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` is sorted**
