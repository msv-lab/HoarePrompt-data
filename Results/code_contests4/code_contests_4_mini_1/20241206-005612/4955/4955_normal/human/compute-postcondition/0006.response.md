The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the predefined conditions that the integers A, B, and C must satisfy, with each being in the range of 1 to 9 inclusive. The output or return value of the function is not explicitly stated in your provided information. Therefore, without further details on how the function behaves with respect to A, B, and C, I cannot specify the return values.
