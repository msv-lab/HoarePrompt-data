`lst` is reassigned to the result of converting each element in the original `lst` to an integer using `map(int, lst)`. Since `lst` is a reversed version of the original sorted list and contains integers between 1 and 9, its values remain within that range after conversion. The states of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not affected, as they are not part of the operation. 

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` is a list of integers derived from the original sorted list**.
