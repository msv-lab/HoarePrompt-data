The code snippet provided prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]`. The state of the other variables, `A`, `B`, and `C`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` is a sorted list of these integers; `ans` is printed.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 9; `lst` is a sorted list of these integers; `ans` is printed.**
