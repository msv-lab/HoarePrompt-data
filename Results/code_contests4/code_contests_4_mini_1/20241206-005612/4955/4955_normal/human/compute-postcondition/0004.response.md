To determine the output state, we begin by noting that `lst` is a list of integers derived from the original sorted list consisting of integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. Since `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers in the range of 1 to 9, the sorted list will also consist of these integers arranged in ascending order.

The code takes the first three elements from `lst` to compute `ans` using the formula:
```
ans = 10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]
```

Here, `lst[0]`, `lst[1]`, and `lst[2]` correspond to the first, second, and third smallest integers from the original sorted list, which are `A`, `B`, and `C` in sorted order.

Since we do not have specific values for `A`, `B`, and `C`, we cannot calculate a precise numeric value for `ans`, but we can describe the calculation.

Given that `lst` contains the sorted values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, we can express the output state as follows:

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` is a sorted list of these integers; `ans` is calculated as 10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2].**
