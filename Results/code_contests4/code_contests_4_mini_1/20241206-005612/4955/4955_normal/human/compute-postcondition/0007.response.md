Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input consisting of three integers (A, B, C) between 1 and 9. It sorts these integers in descending order and computes a value based on the formula `10 * largest + second_largest + third_largest`, where `largest`, `second_largest`, and `third_largest` are the sorted integers. The computed value is then printed. There is no return value from the function. **
