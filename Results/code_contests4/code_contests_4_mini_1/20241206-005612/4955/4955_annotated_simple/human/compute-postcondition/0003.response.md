The code converts `lst` into a list of integers using `map(int, lst)`. Since `lst` is already reversed but not specified in terms of its contents, this operation will create a new list of integers based on the current elements in `lst`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 9; `lst` is now a list of integers created from the previous contents of `lst`.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 9; `lst` is now a list of integers created from the previous contents of `lst`.**
