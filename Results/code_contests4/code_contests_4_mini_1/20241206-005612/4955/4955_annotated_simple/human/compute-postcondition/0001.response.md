The `sort()` method is called on the list `lst`, which will sort the strings in `lst` in ascending order. The integers `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the sorted order of `lst` while keeping `A`, `B`, and `C` unchanged.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B`, `C` <= 9; `lst` is sorted.**
