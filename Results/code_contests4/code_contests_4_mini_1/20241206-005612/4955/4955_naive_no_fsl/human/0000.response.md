Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to generate the maximum possible allowance based on the rules provided in the problem description. The issue lies in how the program constructs the formula.

In the given program:
```python
lst = raw_input().split()
lst.sort()
lst.reverse()
lst = list(map(int, lst))
ans = 10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]
print(ans)
```

The logic assumes that the maximum allowance can be calculated by taking the largest digit, multiplying it by 10, and then adding the other two digits. This is not representative of the possible combinations for the formula X + Y. 

For example, consider the input `2 3 9`. The maximum arrangement of the formula would be `29 + 3`, which equals `32`, but the program would output `92`, which is incorrect. 

Another case is the input `1 5 2`, where the maximum allowance should be calculated as `52 + 1`, resulting in `53`, which the program calculates correctly. However, this is coincidental and does not cover other cases accurately.

Thus, the program fails to account for all possible combinations of the digits and their resulting sums, leading to incorrect outputs in certain situations.
