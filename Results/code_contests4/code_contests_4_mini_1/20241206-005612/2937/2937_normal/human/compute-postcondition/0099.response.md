Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `inp` is an input string from the user with `rep` equal to 2. If `inp` equals 'SAKE', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'TEQUILA', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'VODKA', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'WISKEY', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is neither 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', nor 'WINE', then `res` remains unchanged.***
