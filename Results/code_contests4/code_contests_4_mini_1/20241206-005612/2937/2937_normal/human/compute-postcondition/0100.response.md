Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `inp` is an input string from the user. If `inp` equals 'RUM', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is neither 'RUM' nor any of the specified drinks, then `res` remains unchanged.***
