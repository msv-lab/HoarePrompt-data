Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, and `rep` is 0 if the integer value of `inp` is less than 18. Otherwise, `res` remains 0 and `rep` remains 0, with `inp` being the input string from the user and the first character of `inp` being a digit (between '0' and '9').***
