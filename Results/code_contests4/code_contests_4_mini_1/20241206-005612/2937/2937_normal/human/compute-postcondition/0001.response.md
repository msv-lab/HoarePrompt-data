The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The value of `n` is provided by `int(raw_input())`, which means it will be an integer between 1 and 100, but since the code snippet does not modify `res` or other variables, `res` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `res` is 0**
