Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2. If `inp` equals 'VODKA', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` does not equal 'VODKA', and if `inp` equals 'WISKEY', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'WINE', then `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is neither 'WISKEY' nor 'WINE', then `res` remains unchanged.***
