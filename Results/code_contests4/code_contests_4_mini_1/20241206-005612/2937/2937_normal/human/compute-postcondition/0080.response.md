According to the code, the loop will execute again if `rep` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `rep` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `rep` will be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
