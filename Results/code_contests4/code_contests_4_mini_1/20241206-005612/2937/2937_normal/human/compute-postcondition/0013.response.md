`res` is updated by adding 1 to its previous value, which is 0. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is the input string from the user, the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH', and `inp` is equal to 'BEER'.**
