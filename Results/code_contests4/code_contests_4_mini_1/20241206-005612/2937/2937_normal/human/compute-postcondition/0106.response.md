Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2. If the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is also increased by 1. Otherwise, if `inp` is none of these, then `res` remains unchanged.***
