The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown because it is not provided in the initial state. The values of the other variables (`n`, `inp`, `rep`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 1, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 1, and `res` is increased by 1.**
