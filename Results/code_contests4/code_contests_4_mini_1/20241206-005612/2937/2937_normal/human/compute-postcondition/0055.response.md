The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 1, and `res` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 1, and `res` is increased by 1.**
