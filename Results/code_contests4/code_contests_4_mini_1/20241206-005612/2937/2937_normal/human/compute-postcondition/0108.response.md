The code only contains a print statement that outputs the value of `res`. The variable `res` remains unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is the count of inputs that are either less than 18 or one of the specified alcoholic beverages, `rep` is `n`, and `inp` is the last input string from the user, and we print the value of `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is the count of inputs that are either less than 18 or one of the specified alcoholic beverages, `rep` is `n`, `inp` is the last input string from the user; printed value of `res`.**
