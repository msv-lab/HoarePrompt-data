In the provided code snippet, `res` is incremented by 1. However, the value of `res` is not specified in the initial state. As such, while we know that `res` will increase by 1, we cannot determine its exact value before or after the operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` is increased by 1 without specifying a value.

Output State: **`res` is increased by 1**
