The code `res = res + 1` indicates that the variable `res` is being incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `res`, so we cannot determine its specific change from the initial state. Since `res` is being updated, the other variables `n`, `inp`, and `rep` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `res` is increased by 1, but we do not know its specific value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.**
