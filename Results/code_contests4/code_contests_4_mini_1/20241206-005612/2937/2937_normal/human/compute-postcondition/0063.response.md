The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `res` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `res`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 1, and `res` is increased by 1 (previous value of `res` is unknown).**
