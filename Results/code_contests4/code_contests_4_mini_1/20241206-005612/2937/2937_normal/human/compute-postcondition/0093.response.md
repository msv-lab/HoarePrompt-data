The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state indicates that `res` has been increased by 1 without specifying its previous value. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` has been increased by 1.**
