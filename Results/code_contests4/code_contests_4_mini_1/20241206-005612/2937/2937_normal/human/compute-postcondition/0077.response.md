Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, and `rep` is 1. If `inp` is 'BEER', then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `inp` is 'BRANDY', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', `res` is also increased by 1.**
