The variable `res` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `res` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its new value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `inp`, and `rep`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 1, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 1, and `res` is increased by 1.**
