`res` is incremented by 1. Its previous value is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is the input string 'BRANDY'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'BRANDY'**
