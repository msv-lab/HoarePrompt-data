The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `res` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `res` after execution. The other variables (`n`, `inp`, and `rep`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2; `res` is increased by 1.**
