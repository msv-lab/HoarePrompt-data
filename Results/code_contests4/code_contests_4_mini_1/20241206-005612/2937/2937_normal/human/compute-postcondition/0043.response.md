Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. If `inp` is 'VODKA', then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` is 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is updated to 'WINE'. For any other input string, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` retains its original value, while `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', or 'TEQUILA'.***
