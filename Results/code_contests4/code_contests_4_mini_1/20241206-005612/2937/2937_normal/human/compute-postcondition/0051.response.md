Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `inp` is the input string from the user, which does not start with a digit. If `inp` is 'ABSINTH', then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` is 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is updated accordingly. For any other input string that does not match the specified cases, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` retains its original value.***
