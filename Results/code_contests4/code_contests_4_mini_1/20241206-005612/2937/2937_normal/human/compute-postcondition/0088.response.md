The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `inp`, `rep`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1**
