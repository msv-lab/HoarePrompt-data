The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not provided in the initial state. The values of `n`, `inp`, and `rep` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment without specifying the prior value of `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1**
