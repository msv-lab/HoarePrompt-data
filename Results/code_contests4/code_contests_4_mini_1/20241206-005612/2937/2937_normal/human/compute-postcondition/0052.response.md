Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user. If `inp` starts with a digit, then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` is 0 if the integer value of `inp` is less than 18; otherwise, `res` remains 0 and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` does not start with a digit, `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0 if `inp` is 'ABSINTH'; if `inp` is one of 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is updated accordingly; for any other input string, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` retains its original value.***
