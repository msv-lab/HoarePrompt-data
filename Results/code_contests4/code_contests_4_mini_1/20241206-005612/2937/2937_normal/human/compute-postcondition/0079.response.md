Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, and `rep` is 1. If the first character of `inp` is a digit and the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, `res` is increased by 1. If the first character of `inp` is a digit but the integer value of `inp` is 18 or greater, `res` remains unchanged. If the first character of `inp` is not a digit, and if `inp` is 'ABSINTH', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is one of 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is also increased by 1.***
