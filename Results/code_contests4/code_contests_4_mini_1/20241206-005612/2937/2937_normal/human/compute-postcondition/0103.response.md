Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, and `rep` is 2. If `inp` equals 'BRANDY', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is none of these, then `res` remains unchanged.***
