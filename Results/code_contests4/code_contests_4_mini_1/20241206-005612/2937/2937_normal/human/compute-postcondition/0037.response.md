The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `res` is 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is the input string from the user, the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH', `inp` is not equal to 'BEER', `inp` is not equal to 'BRANDY', `inp` is not equal to 'CHAMPAGNE', `inp` is not equal to 'GIN', `inp` is not equal to 'RUM', `inp` is not equal to 'SAKE', `inp` is not equal to 'TEQUILA', `inp` is not equal to 'VODKA', and `inp` is equal to 'WISKEY'.
