The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state indicates that `res` has been increased by 1, while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100, `inp` is the input string from the user, `rep` is 1, and `res` is increased by 1.**
