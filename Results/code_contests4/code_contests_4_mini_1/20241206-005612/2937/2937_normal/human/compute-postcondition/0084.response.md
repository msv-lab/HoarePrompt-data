The variable `res` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `res` is not provided, so we cannot specify its exact value after the operation. The values of the other variables (`n`, `inp`, and `rep`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1**.
