Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. If `inp` is 'SAKE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is 'SAKE'. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', then `res` is set to 1, and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` is 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1, `rep` remains 0, and if `inp` is 'WINE', `inp` is updated to 'WINE'. For any other input string, `res` and `rep` remain unchanged, and `inp` retains its original value.***
