The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it uses the integer `n` to determine the number of subsequent inputs. The integer `n` must satisfy the constraint of being between 1 and 100. Following this, the function processes `n` lines where each line can either be an integer (representing an age within the range of 0 to 1000) or a string (representing a drink composed of capital Latin letters with a length between 1 and 100). 

The output will depend on the types of inputs provided. If an age is given, the function may evaluate it in relation to the drinking age, and if a drink is provided, it may check whether the drink is alcoholic based on a specified list. The return value is not explicitly defined in the provided information, but it can be inferred that the function will likely provide information on whether the age is of legal drinking age in relation to the drinks listed.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by n lines of input, each either an integer (age between 0 and 1000) or a string (a drink name). It evaluates the ages in relation to the drinks, potentially determining legal drinking status based on the inputs.**
