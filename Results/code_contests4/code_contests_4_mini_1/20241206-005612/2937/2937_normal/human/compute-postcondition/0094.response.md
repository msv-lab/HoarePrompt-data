The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `res` after the increment. The other variables remain unaffected. The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `inp` is an input string from the user, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.**
