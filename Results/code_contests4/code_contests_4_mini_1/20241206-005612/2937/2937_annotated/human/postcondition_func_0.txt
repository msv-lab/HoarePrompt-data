The function accepts an integer input `n` (between 1 and 100) and then processes `n` lines of input, where each line can either be an integer (representing age, from 0 to 1000) or a string (representing a drink name). It counts how many of these inputs are either ages less than 18 or one of the specified alcoholic beverages (such as 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', etc.). After processing all inputs, it prints the total count of such inputs.
