You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: According to Berland laws it is only allowed to sell alcohol to people not younger than 18 years. Vasya's job is to monitor the law's enforcement. Tonight he entered a bar and saw n people sitting there. For every one of them Vasya happened to determine either the age or the drink the person is having. Vasya can check any person, i.e. learn his age and the drink he is having at the same time. What minimal number of people should Vasya check additionally to make sure that there are no clients under 18 having alcohol drinks?

The list of all alcohol drinks in Berland is: ABSINTH, BEER, BRANDY, CHAMPAGNE, GIN, RUM, SAKE, TEQUILA, VODKA, WHISKEY, WINE

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) which is the number of the bar's clients. Then follow n lines, each describing one visitor. A line either contains his age (an integer from 0 to 1000) or his drink (a string of capital Latin letters from 1 to 100 in length). It is guaranteed that the input data does not contain spaces and other unnecessary separators.

Only the drinks from the list given above should be considered alcohol.

Output

Print a single number which is the number of people Vasya should check to guarantee the law enforcement.

Examples

Input

5
18
VODKA
COKE
19
17


Output

2

Note

In the sample test the second and fifth clients should be checked.
