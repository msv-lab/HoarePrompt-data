Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2. If the first character of `inp` is a digit and `inp` converted to an integer is less than 18, then `res` is increased by 1; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `res` is increased by 1 if `inp` is 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', or 'CHAMPAGNE', or if `inp` is one of 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE'. If `inp` does not match any of these specified drinks, `res` remains unchanged.***
