`res` is assigned the value of `res + 1`. Given that the initial value of `res` is 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'GIN'.
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'GIN'**
