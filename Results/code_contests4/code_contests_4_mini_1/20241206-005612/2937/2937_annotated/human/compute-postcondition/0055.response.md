The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `res` is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `res` has increased by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 1, `inp` is a string input from the user; `res` is increased by 1**
