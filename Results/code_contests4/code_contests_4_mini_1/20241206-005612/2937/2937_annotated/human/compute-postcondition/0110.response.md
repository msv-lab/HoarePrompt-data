The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input arguments. Instead, it processes `n` lines of input where `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 100. Each of these lines can either be an integer (representing age) from 0 to 1000 or a string (representing a drink) consisting of capital Latin letters with a length between 1 and 100. The output of the function is not specified, but it processes the inputs based on the defined constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes `n` lines of input where `n` is between 1 and 100, with each line being either an integer (age) from 0 to 1000 or a string (drink) of capital Latin letters (length 1 to 100). The specific output based on these inputs is not detailed.**
