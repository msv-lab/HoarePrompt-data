The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without changing any variable values. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and we do not proceed to print the value of `res`. The output state reflects the current values of all variables and indicates that the program has exited. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `res` is the count of inputs that are either less than 18 or one of the specified alcoholic beverages; `rep` is `n`; and the program has exited.**
