The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown since it is not provided in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string from raw_input(), and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string from raw_input(), and `res` is increased by 1.**
