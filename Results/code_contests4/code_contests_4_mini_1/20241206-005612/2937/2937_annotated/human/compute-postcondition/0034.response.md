`res` is assigned the value of `res + 1`. Since `res` is initially 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string where the first character is not a digit, and `inp` equals 'VODKA'.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string where the first character is not a digit, and `inp` equals 'VODKA'**
