According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current value of `rep`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1 and `rep` is the current iteration variable which has been incremented in each iteration of the loop. Thus, for the loop to execute once more, `rep` must be less than `n`. 

Since `rep` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, after the last iteration, `rep` would be 1 if it executed once. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
