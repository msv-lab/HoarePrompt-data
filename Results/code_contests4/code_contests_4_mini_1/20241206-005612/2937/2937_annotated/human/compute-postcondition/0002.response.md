According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, this means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Before the loop starts, `res` is 0, which does not affect the number of iterations, but it is important to note that `rep` will be initialized in the loop. For the loop to execute the first time, `rep` should be 0, as it will start at 0 when the loop begins.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and that `rep` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `res` is 0, `rep` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
