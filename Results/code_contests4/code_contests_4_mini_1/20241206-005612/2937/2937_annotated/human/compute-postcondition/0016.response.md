The value of `res` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, after execution, `res` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'BRANDY'.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'BRANDY'**
