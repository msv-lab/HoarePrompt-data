The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string from raw_input(); variable `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string from raw_input(); variable `res` is increased by 1**
