`res` is assigned the value of `res + 1`. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string, the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH', `inp` is not equal to 'BEER', `inp` is not equal to 'BRANDY', `inp` is not equal to 'CHAMPAGNE', `inp` is not equal to 'GIN', and `inp` is equal to 'RUM'.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string, the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH', `inp` is not equal to 'BEER', `inp` is not equal to 'BRANDY', `inp` is not equal to 'CHAMPAGNE', `inp` is not equal to 'GIN', and `inp` is equal to 'RUM'**.
