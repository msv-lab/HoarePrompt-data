The variable `res` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `res` is not provided, so we cannot specify the exact value after the increment. The values of the other variables (`n` and `rep`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1**
