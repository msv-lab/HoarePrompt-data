The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The other variables (`n` and `rep`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1**
