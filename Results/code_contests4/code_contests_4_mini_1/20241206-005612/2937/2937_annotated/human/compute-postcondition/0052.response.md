Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1 and `inp` is an input string. If the first character of `inp` is a digit between '0' and '9', and if the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. Otherwise, if `inp` is 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', or one of 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. In all other cases, both `res` and `rep` remain 0.***
