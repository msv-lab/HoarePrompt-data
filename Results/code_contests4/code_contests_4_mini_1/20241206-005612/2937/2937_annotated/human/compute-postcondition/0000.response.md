The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input that is interpreted as an integer. Since `n` is defined to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, its value will be within that range based on the input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100**
