According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `rep` and the limit `n`. The loop will execute while `rep` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `rep` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, which means the loop can execute again for the second time. For the loop to execute a second time, `rep` will be incremented by 1, so `rep` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
