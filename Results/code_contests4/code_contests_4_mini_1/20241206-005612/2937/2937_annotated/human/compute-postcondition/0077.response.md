Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 1, and `inp` is a string input from the user. If `inp` is 'BEER', then `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is neither 'BEER' nor any of the specified drinks, then `res` remains unchanged.***
