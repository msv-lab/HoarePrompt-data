The variable `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` was 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is equal to 'WISKEY'.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is equal to 'WISKEY'**
