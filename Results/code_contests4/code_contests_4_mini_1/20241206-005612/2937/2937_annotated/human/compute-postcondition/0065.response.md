The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 1, `inp` is a string input from the user, and `res` is increased by 1.**
