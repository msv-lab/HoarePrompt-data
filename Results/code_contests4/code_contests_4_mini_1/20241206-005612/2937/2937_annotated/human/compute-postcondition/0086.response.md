The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The values of `n` and `rep` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2, and `res` is increased by 1**
