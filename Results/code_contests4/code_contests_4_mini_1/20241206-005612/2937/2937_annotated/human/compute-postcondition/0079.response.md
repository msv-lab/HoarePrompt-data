Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 1, and `inp` is a string input from the user. If the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `inp` matches none of these specified conditions, then `res` remains unchanged.***
