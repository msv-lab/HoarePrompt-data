Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 2, and if `inp` is 'RUM', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'SAKE', then `res` is also increased by 1. Additionally, if `inp` is 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is neither 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', nor 'WINE', then `res` remains unchanged.***
