`res` is assigned the value of `res + 1`. Initially, `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string where the first character is not a digit and is equal to 'TEQUILA'.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string where the first character is not a digit and is equal to 'TEQUILA'**
