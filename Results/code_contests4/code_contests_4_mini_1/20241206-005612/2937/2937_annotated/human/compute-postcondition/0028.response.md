`res` is assigned the value `res + 1`. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'SAKE'.
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'SAKE'**
