`res` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `res` is not defined, but it is now explicitly set to `0`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `res` is 0.  
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `res` is 0**
