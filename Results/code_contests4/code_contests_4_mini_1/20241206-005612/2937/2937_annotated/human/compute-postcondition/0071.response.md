Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `rep` is 1, and `inp` is a string input from the user. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is neither 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', nor 'WINE', then `res` remains unchanged.***
