`inp` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which retrieves input from the user as a string. The variables `n`, `res`, and `rep` remain unchanged in value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 0, `rep` is 0, and `inp` is an input string from the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 0, `rep` is 0, and `inp` is an input string from the user.**
