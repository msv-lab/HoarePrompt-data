`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string from the user, the first character of `inp` is a digit (between '0' and '9'), and the integer value of `inp` is less than 18.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string from the user, the first character of `inp` is a digit (between '0' and '9'), and the integer value of `inp` is less than 18.**
