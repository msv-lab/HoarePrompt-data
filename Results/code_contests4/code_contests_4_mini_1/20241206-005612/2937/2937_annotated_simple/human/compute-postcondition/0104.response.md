Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string. If `inp` equals 'BEER', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'BRANDY', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is one of the values 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1 for each of these specified values. If `inp` does not match 'BEER', 'BRANDY', or any of the specified alcoholic beverages, then `res` remains unchanged.***
