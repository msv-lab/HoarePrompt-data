The code `exit(0)` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the program is halted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is the count of inputs that are either less than 18 or one of the specified alcoholic beverages, `rep` is `n - 1`, and the program has been terminated.
