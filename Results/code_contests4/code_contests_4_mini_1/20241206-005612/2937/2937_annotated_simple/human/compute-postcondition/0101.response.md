Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `rep` is 2, and `inp` is an input string. If `inp` equals 'GIN', then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `inp` equals 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1 for each of these values. If `inp` is none of these specified values, then `res` remains unchanged.***
