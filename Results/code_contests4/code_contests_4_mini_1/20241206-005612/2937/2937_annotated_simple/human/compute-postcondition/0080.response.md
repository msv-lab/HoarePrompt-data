According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rep` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute again if `rep` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. The value of `rep` is currently 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `rep` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `rep` must be less than `n`, which implies that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `rep` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
