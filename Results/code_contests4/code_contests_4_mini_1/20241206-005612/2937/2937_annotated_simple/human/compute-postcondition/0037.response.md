The value of `res` is incremented by 1, and since `res` was previously 0, the new value of `res` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'WISKEY'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'WISKEY'**
