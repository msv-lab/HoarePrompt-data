Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; if `inp` equals 'RUM', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'SAKE', then `res` is also increased by 1. Additionally, if `inp` is 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1 as well. If `inp` is none of these specified values, then `res` remains unchanged.***
