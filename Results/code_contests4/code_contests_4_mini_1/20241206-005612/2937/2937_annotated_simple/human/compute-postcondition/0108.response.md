The `print(res)` statement outputs the current value of `res`, which is the count of inputs that are either less than 18 or one of the specified alcoholic beverages. The values of `n` and `rep` are not affected by this print statement. 

The output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n` and `rep`, along with the value of `res` that is being printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is the count of inputs that are either less than 18 or one of the specified alcoholic beverages, `rep` is `n - 1`**
