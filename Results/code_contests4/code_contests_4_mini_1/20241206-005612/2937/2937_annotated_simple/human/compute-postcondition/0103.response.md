Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `rep` is 2, and `inp` is an input string. If `inp` equals 'BRANDY', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', `res` is also increased by 1 for each of these specified values. If `inp` does not match any of these values, then `res` remains unchanged.***
