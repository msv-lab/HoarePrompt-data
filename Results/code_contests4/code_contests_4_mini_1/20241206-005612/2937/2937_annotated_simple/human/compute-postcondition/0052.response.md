Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is set to 1 and `rep` is 0 if the first character of `inp` is a digit and the integer value of `inp` is less than 18. If `inp` is 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', or any of 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. For any other value of `inp`, `res` remains 0 and `rep` remains 0.***
