Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. If `inp` is 'VODKA', then `res` is set to 2 and `rep` remains 1. If `inp` is 'WISKEY' or 'WINE', then `res` is also set to 2 and `rep` remains 1. If `inp` is neither 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', nor 'WINE', then `res` remains 1 and `rep` remains 1.***
