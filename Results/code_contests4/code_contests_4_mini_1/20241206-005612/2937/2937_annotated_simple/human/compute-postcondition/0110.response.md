The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer with a constraint that it must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Following this, the function processes n lines of input, each of which can either be an integer representing an age (in the range 0 to 1000) or a string representing a drink name (composed of 1 to 100 capital Latin letters). 

While there are no explicit return outputs mentioned in the provided information, the function is assumed to perform some operations based on the received inputs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and subsequently process n lines of input that can either be integers (ages) or strings (drink names) while adhering to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and processes n subsequent lines of input, where each line can be either an integer (age in the range 0 to 1000) or a string (drink name with 1 to 100 capital Latin letters).**
