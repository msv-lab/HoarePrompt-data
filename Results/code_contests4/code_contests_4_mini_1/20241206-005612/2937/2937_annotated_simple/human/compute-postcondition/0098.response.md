Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; if `inp` equals 'TEQUILA', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'VODKA', `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` equals 'WISKEY' or 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1 as well. If `inp` is none of these values, `res` remains unchanged.***
