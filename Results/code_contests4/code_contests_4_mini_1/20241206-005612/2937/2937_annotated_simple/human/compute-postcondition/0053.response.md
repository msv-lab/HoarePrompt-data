According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rep` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `rep` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `rep` is 0, meaning the loop has executed 0 times. For the loop to execute one more time, `rep` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, `rep` must be less than `n`, which is already satisfied since `n` is between 1 and 100.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is set to 1, `rep` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
