The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `res` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `res` after the increment. The states of the other variables (`n`, `rep`, `inp`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.**
