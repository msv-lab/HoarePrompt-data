The variable `res` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `res` is unknown from the given initial state; therefore, we cannot determine its specific value after the execution. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.**
