The value of `res` is incremented by 1, and since `res` is initially 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `rep`, and `inp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'GIN'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'GIN'**
