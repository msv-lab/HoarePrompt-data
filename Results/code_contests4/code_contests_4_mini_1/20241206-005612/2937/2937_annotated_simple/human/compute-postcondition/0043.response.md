Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. If `inp` is 'VODKA', then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` is 'WISKEY' or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains 0. For all other values of `inp`, including cases where `inp` is not equal to 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', `res` remains 0 and `rep` remains 0.***
