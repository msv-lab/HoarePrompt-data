Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. If `inp` is 'BRANDY', then `res` is set to 2 and `rep` is 1. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', or 'SAKE', then `res` is set to 2 and `rep` is 1. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is set to 2 and `rep` remains 1. If `inp` is none of these values, then `res` remains 1 and `rep` remains 1.***
