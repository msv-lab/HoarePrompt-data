According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is specified to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is 0. For the loop to be executed the first time, `rep` should start at 0, which is the first value in the range of `n`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 0, `rep` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
