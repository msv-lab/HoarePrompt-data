The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since `res` was initially set to 1, the new value of `res` will be 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 2, `rep` is 1, `inp` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 2, `rep` is 1, `inp` is an input string**
