The variable `res` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `res`, so we cannot determine its specific value after the operation. Other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.**
