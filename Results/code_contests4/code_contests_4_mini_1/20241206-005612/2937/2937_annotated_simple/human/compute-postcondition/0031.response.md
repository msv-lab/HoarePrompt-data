`res` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 0. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string from the user, the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH', `inp` is not equal to 'BEER', `inp` is not equal to 'BRANDY', `inp` is not equal to 'CHAMPAGNE', `inp` is not equal to 'GIN', `inp` is not equal to 'RUM', `inp` is not equal to 'SAKE', and `inp` is equal to 'TEQUILA'**.
