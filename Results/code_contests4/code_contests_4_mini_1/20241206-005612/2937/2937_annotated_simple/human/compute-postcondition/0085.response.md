The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown as it has not been provided in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `rep`, and `inp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `rep` is 2; `inp` is an input string; `res` is increased by 1**.
