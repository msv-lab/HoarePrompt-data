Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `rep` is 2, and `inp` is an input string. If the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `inp` is 'ABSINTH', then `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'BEER', 'BRANDY', or any of the specified alcoholic beverages ('CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', 'WINE'), then `res` is increased by 1 for each matching case. If none of these conditions are met, `res` remains unchanged.***
