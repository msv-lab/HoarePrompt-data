Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Drink Name Check for "WISKEY":** The problem description refers to the alcoholic drink as "WHISKEY", but in the program, it checks for "WISKEY". This is a typographical error that would lead to undercounting the number of people Vasya needs to check, as any instance of "WHISKEY" would not be recognized as an alcoholic drink.

2. **Input Handling:** The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be replaced with `input()`). This could lead to execution errors if run in a Python 3 environment.

3. **Counting Logic:** The counting logic is overly verbose with multiple `elif` statements. While it does work to count the number of people who either are underage or consuming alcohol, it could be condensed to make the code more efficient and easier to maintain. However, this is not directly a correctness issue.

4. **General Structure:** The program does not handle possible edge cases, such as input values outside of the specified range, but given the problem guarantees valid input, this is more of a structural concern than a correctness issue.

Overall, the program fails to correctly identify all cases that require additional checks due to the typo in the drink name and does not handle input correctly in Python 3, leading to a conclusion that it does not fulfill the problem's requirements accurately.
