Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the print operation correctly. Specifically, the output format for the print statements does not match the expected output format as described in the problem. 

In the problem description, it specifies that the output for the print operation should print a list of keys obtained by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk with a space character before each key. However, in the program, the print statements in `func_3` and `func_4` do not account for the formatting requirements of having a space before each key. 

For example, when printing the inorder traversal, if the keys are `1, 12, 17, 20, 25, 30, 88`, the expected output should be:

```
 1 12 17 20 25 30 88
```

But instead, the code prints the keys without the necessary leading space. Therefore, if we run the program with the provided input, the output will not match the expected output format, leading to incorrect results.

This formatting issue indicates that the program does not fully meet the criteria specified in the problem description, hence it is considered incorrect.
