You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a program which performs the following operations to a binary search tree $T$ by adding the find operation to A: Binary Search Tree I.

* insert  $k$: Insert a node containing $k$ as key into $T$.
* find $k$: Report whether $T$ has a node containing $k$.
* print: Print the keys of the binary search tree by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk respectively.

Constraints

* The number of operations $\leq 500,000$
* The number of print operations $\leq 10$.
* $-2,000,000,000 \leq key \leq 2,000,000,000$
* The height of the binary tree does not exceed 100 if you employ the above pseudo code.
* The keys in the binary search tree are all different.

Input

In the first line, the number of operations $m$ is given. In the following $m$ lines, operations represented by insert $k$, find $k$ or print are given.

Output

For each find $k$ operation, print "yes" if $T$ has a node containing $k$, "no" if not.

In addition, for each print operation, print a list of keys obtained by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk in a line respectively. Put a space character before each key.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: top is the root node of a binary search tree, z is a list of strings representing operations, where each operation is either 'insert k', 'find k', or 'print'. The integer k in the operations is within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000 and each key in the binary search tree is unique. The number of operations in z does not exceed 500,000.
def func_1(top, z):
    y = None
    x = top
    while isinstance(x, Node):
        y = x
        
        if z.key < x.key:
            x = x.left
        else:
            x = x.right
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is the last valid node encountered in the binary search tree during the traversal, `x` is None indicating the search has reached a leaf node, and `z` is a list of strings representing operations. If `z.key` is less than the key of the node that `y` points to, then `z.key` is not present in the tree; otherwise, `z.key` is either equal to or greater than the value at `y`, indicating the location in the tree where `z.key` would be found or inserted.
    z.parent = y
    if (y is None) :
        top = z
    else :
        if (z.key < y.key) :
            y.left = z
        else :
            y.right = z
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`y` is the last valid node encountered in the binary search tree and is not None. If `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`. Otherwise, if `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`. The `z` list contains strings representing operations, and `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. `x` is None, indicating the search has reached a leaf node.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`y` is the last valid node encountered in the binary search tree. If `y` is None, `top` is assigned the value of `z`, which is a list of strings representing operations. If `y` is not None, `z` is assigned as the left child of `y` if `z.key` is less than `y.key`, or as the right child of `y` if `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`. The `z` list contains strings representing operations, and `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. `x` remains None, indicating that the search has reached a leaf node.
    return top
    #The program returns the variable 'top', which is assigned the value of 'z' when 'y' is None, indicating that 'top' contains the list of strings representing operations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a root node of a binary search tree (`top`) and a new node (`z`), which is expected to be a list of strings representing operations. It traverses the tree to find the appropriate position for `z` based on its key value. If `z` is less than the key of the last valid node (`y`), it becomes the left child; otherwise, it becomes the right child of `y`. If no valid node is found (i.e., `y` is None), `top` is assigned the value of `z`. The function returns the updated `top`, which may now be a new tree root if `z` was the first node. However, if `top` is not modified, it will still represent the original tree structure with the inserted node. The function does not handle cases where `z` is already present in the tree or any operations other than insertion.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is the root of a binary search tree, key is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000, and the binary search tree contains unique keys.
def func_2(node, key):
    if (not node) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the key is not present in the binary search tree as the node is null.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`node` is the root of a binary search tree, `key` is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000, and the binary search tree contains unique keys. `node` is not None.
    if (node.key == key) :
        return True
        #The program returns True as the key of the node is equal to the specified key
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`node` is the root of a binary search tree, `key` is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000, and the binary search tree contains unique keys. `node` is not None, and the key of the `node` is not equal to `key`.
    if (key < node.key) :
        return func_2(node.left, key)
        #The program returns the result of calling func_2 with the left child of the node and the given key, where the key is less than the key of the node.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`node` is the root of a binary search tree, `key` is an integer within the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000, and the binary search tree contains unique keys. `node` is not None, the key of the `node` is not equal to `key`, and the key is greater than or equal to the key of the `node`.
    return func_2(node.right, key)
    #The program returns the result of calling func_2 with the right child of the current node and the key, continuing the search in the right subtree of the binary search tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary tree node `node` and an integer `key`, and it checks whether `key` exists in the binary search tree. It returns `False` if the node is null (indicating the key is not present), `True` if the key matches the current node's key, and recursively searches the left child if the key is less than the current node's key, or the right child if the key is greater. The function does not handle cases where the binary search tree is empty (i.e., the initial `node` is null) properly as it only returns `False`, but it correctly identifies if the key exists in the tree.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is the root of a binary search tree where each key is a unique integer in the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The number of operations performed on the tree does not exceed 500,000, and the height of the tree does not exceed 100.
def func_3(node):
    if node.left :
        func_3(node.left)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`node` is the root of a binary search tree where each key is a unique integer in the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. If `node.left` exists, then `func_3(node.left)` is called. If `node.left` does not exist, no action is taken.
    print('', node.key, end='')
    if node.right :
        func_3(node.right)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`node` is the root of a binary search tree where each key is a unique integer in the range -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000; if `node` has a right child, the key of the node is printed followed by a space, and the function `func_3` is called with `node.right`. If `node` does not have a right child, the key of the node is still printed followed by a space, but `func_3` is not called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a node that is the root of a binary search tree and performs an in-order traversal of the tree. It prints the keys of the nodes in ascending order, separated by spaces. The function does not return any value or indication of completion. It handles cases where the node has both left and right children, only one child, or no children at all.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer m (1 <= m <= 500,000) representing the number of operations, followed by m operations which can be "insert k", "find k", or "print". The value k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000, and all keys in the binary search tree are unique.
def func_4(node):
    print('', node.key, end='')
    if node.left :
        func_4(node.left)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *The program prints the key of the left child node with a preceding space if the left child node exists; otherwise, no action is taken regarding the printing.
    if node.right :
        func_4(node.right)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If the right child node of `node` exists, the function `func_4` is called with `node.right` as the argument. If the right child does not exist, no action is taken regarding the printing of the left child node.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `node`, which represents a node in a binary search tree, and performs an in-order traversal of the tree. It prints the keys of the nodes in ascending order, separated by spaces. The function does not handle the "insert k" or "find k" operations, which were mentioned in the annotations but are not implemented in the code. It only prints the keys of the nodes recursively, following the left child, then the current node, and finally the right child.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
