Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the required operations for a binary search tree as specified in the problem description. 

1. **Insertion Logic**: In `func_1`, the logic for inserting a new node (`z`) is flawed. The code attempts to insert a node represented by the list `z`, which is not the correct approach. Instead, `z` should be an instance of a `Node`, and the logic should check if a node with the same key already exists. If it does, the program should not insert it again, which is not handled.

2. **Finding Logic**: The function `func_2` correctly checks if a key exists in the binary search tree. However, it does not handle cases where the tree is empty (i.e., when the initial `node` is null). While it returns `False` if the node is null, it does not communicate that the search was attempted on an empty tree.

3. **Print Operations**: The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are supposed to handle the printing of the tree nodes in inorder and preorder traversals, respectively. However, the problem description requires both traversals to be printed when the "print" operation is called. The current implementations do not distinguish between these two types of traversals; they only print in-order traversal. 

4. **Edge Cases**: The annotations do not mention how the program would behave when attempting to insert a key that already exists in the tree or how it would handle the scenario where multiple operations are executed in a specific order. These edge cases are crucial as they are common in binary search tree operations.

Overall, due to the issues in insertion logic, handling of empty trees, and the lack of proper traversal handling for print operations, the program does not adhere to the problem description in every potential case. Thus, the correctness is deemed false.
