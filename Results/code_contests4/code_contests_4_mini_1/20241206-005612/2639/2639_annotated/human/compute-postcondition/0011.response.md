Functionality: ** The function accepts a binary tree node `node` and an integer `key`, and it checks whether `key` exists in the binary search tree. It returns `False` if the node is null (indicating the key is not present), `True` if the key matches the current node's key, and recursively searches the left child if the key is less than the current node's key, or the right child if the key is greater. The function does not handle cases where the binary search tree is empty (i.e., the initial `node` is null) properly as it only returns `False`, but it correctly identifies if the key exists in the tree.**
