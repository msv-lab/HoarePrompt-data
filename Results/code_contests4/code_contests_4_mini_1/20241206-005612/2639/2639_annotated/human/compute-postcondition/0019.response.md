Output State: **`y` is the last valid node encountered in the binary search tree during the traversal, `x` is None indicating the search has reached a leaf node, and `z` is a list of strings representing operations. If `z.key` is less than the key of the node that `y` points to, then `z.key` is not present in the tree; otherwise, `z.key` is either equal to or greater than the value at `y`, indicating the location in the tree where `z.key` would be found or inserted.**
