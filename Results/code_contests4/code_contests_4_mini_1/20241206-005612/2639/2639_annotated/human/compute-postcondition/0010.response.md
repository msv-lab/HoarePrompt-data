The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `node` and `key`. The `node` is the root of a binary search tree, and `key` is an integer within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The binary search tree contains unique keys. 

After executing the function body, the function will return the following based on the conditions checked:

- Case 1: If `node` is null, the function returns `False`, indicating that the key is not present in the binary search tree.
- Case 2: If the key of the node is equal to the specified `key`, the function returns `True`.
- Case 3: If the `key` is less than the key of the node, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with the left child of the node and the given `key`.
- Case 4: If the `key` is greater than the key of the node, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with the right child of the current node and the `key`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to search for a specified integer `key` in a binary search tree rooted at `node` and return whether the key is present in the tree or not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `node` (the root of a binary search tree) and an integer `key`, and it returns `False` if the key is not present (node is null), `True` if the key matches the node's key, or recursively searches the left or right subtree based on the comparison of the `key` with the node's key.**
