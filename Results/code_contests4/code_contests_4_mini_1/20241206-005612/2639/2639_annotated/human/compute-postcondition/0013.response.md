Postcondition: ***`top` is the root node of a binary search tree, `y` is a valid child node of `top`, and `z` is a list of strings representing operations. If `z.key` is less than `x.key`, then `x` is assigned to the left child of its current node. Otherwise, `x` is updated to the right child of its current node.***
