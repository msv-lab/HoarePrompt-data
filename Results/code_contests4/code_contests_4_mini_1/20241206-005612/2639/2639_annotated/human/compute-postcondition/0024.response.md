Postcondition: ***`y` is the last valid node encountered in the binary search tree during the traversal and is not None; `x` is None indicating the search has reached a leaf node; `z` is a list of strings representing operations; `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`; and `z.key` is less than `y.key`.***
