Postcondition: ***`y` is the last valid node encountered in the binary search tree during the traversal; `x` is None indicating the search has reached a leaf node; `z` is a list of strings representing operations; `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`; `y` is not None; and the key of `z` is greater than or equal to the key of `y`.***
