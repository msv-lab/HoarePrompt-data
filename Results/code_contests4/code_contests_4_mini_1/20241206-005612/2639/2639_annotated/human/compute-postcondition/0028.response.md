Postcondition: ***`y` is the last valid node encountered in the binary search tree and is not None. If `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`. Otherwise, if `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`. The `z` list contains strings representing operations, and `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. `x` is None, indicating the search has reached a leaf node.***
