The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `top`, which is the root node of a binary search tree, and `z`, which is a list of strings representing operations. The operations can be either 'insert k', 'find k', or 'print', where the integer k is within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000 and each key in the binary search tree is unique. The function returns the variable `top`. If `y` is None, it indicates that `top` contains the list of strings representing operations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `top` (the root node of a binary search tree) and a parameter `z` (a list of strings representing operations), and it returns the variable `top`.**
