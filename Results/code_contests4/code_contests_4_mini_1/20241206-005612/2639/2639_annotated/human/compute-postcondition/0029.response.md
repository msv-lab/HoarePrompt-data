Postcondition: ***`y` is the last valid node encountered in the binary search tree. If `y` is None, `top` is assigned the value of `z`, which is a list of strings representing operations. If `y` is not None, `z` is assigned as the left child of `y` if `z.key` is less than `y.key`, or as the right child of `y` if `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`. The `z` list contains strings representing operations, and `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. `x` remains None, indicating that the search has reached a leaf node.***
