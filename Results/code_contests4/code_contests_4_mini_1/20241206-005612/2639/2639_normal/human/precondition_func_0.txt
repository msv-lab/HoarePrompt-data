top is the root node of a binary search tree, and z is a list of operations where each operation is either "insert k", "find k", or "print". The key k in "insert k" and "find k" is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The number of operations m is a non-negative integer such that m <= 500,000.
