To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and the provided function output hints, let's analyze each function and its output hints.

### Problem Description:
The program is supposed to implement a binary search tree (BST) with the following operations:
- **insert k**: Insert a node containing `k` into the BST.
- **find k**: Report whether the BST contains a node with key `k`.
- **print**: Print the keys of the BST using in-order and pre-order tree walks.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (Insertion)**:
   - The `func_1` function handles the insertion of a new node `z` into the BST. It correctly finds the appropriate location based on the BST properties and updates the tree accordingly.
   - The output hint accurately describes the functionality of this function.

2. **Function 2 (Finding a Key)**:
   - The `func_2` function recursively searches for a key in the BST and returns whether it exists. This function appears to be correct, as it adheres to the properties of a binary search tree.
   - The output hint also describes this function correctly.

3. **Function 3 (In-order Traversal)**:
   - The `func_3` function performs in-order traversal of the BST, printing keys in ascending order. It correctly handles the traversal and prints the keys.
   - The output hint matches the function's purpose.

4. **Function 4 (Pre-order Traversal)**:
   - The `func_4` function performs pre-order traversal of the BST, printing the keys in the correct order. However, it does not handle the case when the input node is `None`, which could lead to an error if the BST is empty when the `print` command is called.
   - The output hint describes this function correctly but does not address the potential `None` input case.

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues:
The most significant edge case arises when the `print` command is called on an empty BST. In this case:
- `func_3` will not print anything, which is acceptable.
- However, `func_4` does not check if the `node` is `None` before attempting to print, which will cause an AttributeError when trying to access `node.key`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, while the main functionalities of insertion, finding, and in-order traversal are correctly implemented, the pre-order traversal function (`func_4`) does not correctly handle the case when the BST is empty. 

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when handling an empty BST during the print operation.

Correctness: **False**.
