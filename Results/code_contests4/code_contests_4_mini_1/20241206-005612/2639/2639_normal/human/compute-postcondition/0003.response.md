Postcondition: ***`node` is the root node of a binary search tree; `node.key` is printed with an empty string before it. If `node` has a left child node, the function `func_4` is called with `node.left` as the argument. If `node` does not have a left child node, only `node.key` is printed and no other actions are taken.***
