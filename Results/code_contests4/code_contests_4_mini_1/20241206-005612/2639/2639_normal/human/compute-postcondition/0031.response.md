The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `top`, which is the root node of a binary search tree, and `z`, which is a list of operations that can be either "insert k", "find k", or "print". Each key `k` in the operations is an integer within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000, and the number of operations `m` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 500,000. After executing the operations specified in `z`, the function returns the root node of the binary search tree, which will be the value of `top` if it is `None` or remains unchanged if it is not `None`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a root node of a binary search tree and a list of operations, returning the root node of the tree after processing the operations. If the root node is None, it returns the value of the operations; otherwise, it returns the unchanged root node.**
