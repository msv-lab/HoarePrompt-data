Postcondition: ***`node` is the root node of a binary search tree. If `node` has a right child, `node.key` is printed along with an empty string, and the function `func_4` is called with `node.right` as the argument. If `node` does not have a right child, only `node.key` is printed with an empty string and no other actions are taken.***
