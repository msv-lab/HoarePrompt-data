Postcondition: ***`x` is None, `y` is the last node encountered in the search path for `z.key`, `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree, and `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, where `y` is not None. If `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`. Otherwise, if `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.***
