Postcondition: ***`x` is None, `y` is the last node encountered in the search path for `z.key`, and `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree. If `y` is None, then `top` is assigned the value of `z`, and `z.parent` is None. Otherwise, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, and if `y` is not None, then if `z.key` is less than `y.key`, `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`; otherwise, `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.***
