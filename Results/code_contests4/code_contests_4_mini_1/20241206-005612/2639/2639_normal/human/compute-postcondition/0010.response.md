The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `node`, which is the root node of a binary search tree, and `key`, which is an integer within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. 

After executing the function body, the function will evaluate the following cases:
- Case 1: If the node is not present in the binary search tree, the function returns `False`.
- Case 2: If the key of the node is equal to the provided key, the function returns `True`.
- Case 3: If the provided key is less than the key of the current node, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with the left child of the current node and the provided key.
- Case 4: If the provided key is greater than the key of the current node, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` on the right child of the node with the provided key.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a binary search tree node and an integer key, and return whether the key exists in the binary search tree, returning `True` if it does, `False` if it does not, or recursively searching through the appropriate child nodes based on the key value comparison. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node (the root of a binary search tree) and an integer key, returning `True` if the key exists in the tree, `False` if it does not, or recursively checking the left or right child nodes based on the key comparison.**
