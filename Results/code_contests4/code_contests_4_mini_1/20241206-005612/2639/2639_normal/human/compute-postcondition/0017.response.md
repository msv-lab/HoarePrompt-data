The variable `x` is assigned the value of `x.right`, which means `x` will now refer to the right child of its current node in the binary search tree. The variable `y` remains unchanged and still holds the value of the original `x`. The state of `top` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`top` is the root node of a binary search tree; `y` is assigned the value of the original `x`, and `x` is now the right child of its previous value.**
