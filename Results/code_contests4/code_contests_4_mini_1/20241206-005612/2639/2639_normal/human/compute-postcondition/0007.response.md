The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `node`, which is the root node of a binary search tree. The keys in this tree are unique integers within the range of [-2,000,000,000, 2,000,000,000]. Additionally, there is an integer `m` that represents the number of operations, constrained such that 1 <= m <= 500,000. The function performs certain operations based on the tree structure and the value of `m`, but the specific output is not described in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `node` which is the root of a binary search tree with unique integer keys in the range [-2,000,000,000, 2,000,000,000] and an integer `m` representing the number of operations (1 <= m <= 500,000). The specific return value is not detailed.**
