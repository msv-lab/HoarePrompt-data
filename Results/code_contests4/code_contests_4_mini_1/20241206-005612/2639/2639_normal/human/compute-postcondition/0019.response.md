Output State: **`x` is None, `y` is the last node encountered in the search path for `z.key`, `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree. If `z.key` was not found in the tree, then `y` is the node where `z.key` would be inserted, either as a left or right child depending on the comparison with `y.key`.**
