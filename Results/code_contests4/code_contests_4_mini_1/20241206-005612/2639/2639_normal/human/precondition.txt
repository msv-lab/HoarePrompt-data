The first input is an integer m representing the number of operations (1 <= m <= 500,000), followed by m lines of operations where each operation is either 'insert k' or 'find k' or 'print'. The value k is an integer satisfying -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The keys inserted into the binary search tree are all unique.
