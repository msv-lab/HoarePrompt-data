Postcondition: ***`x` is None, `y` is not None, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree and is not None. If `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`. If `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.***
