The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `top`, which is the root node of a binary search tree, and `z`, which is a list of operations. Each operation is a string that can be in the format of "insert k", "find k", or "print", where `k` is an integer within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The number of operations in `z` does not exceed 500,000. After executing the operations specified in `z`, the function returns the root node of the binary search tree, which is guaranteed not to be `None`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the root node of a binary search tree and a list of operations to perform on that tree, ultimately returning the root node after processing all the operations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `top`, the root node of a binary search tree, and a parameter `z`, a list of operations. It returns the root node of the binary search tree after performing the specified operations, which is guaranteed to be not None.**
