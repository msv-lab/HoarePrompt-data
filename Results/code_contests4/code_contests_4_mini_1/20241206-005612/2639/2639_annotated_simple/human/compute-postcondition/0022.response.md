`top` is assigned the value of `z`, which doesn't change any of the other variables directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is None, `y` is None, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `top` is assigned the value of `z`, and `top` is not None as it references `z`.

Output State: **`x` is None, `y` is None, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `top` is assigned the value of `z`, and `top` is not None.**
