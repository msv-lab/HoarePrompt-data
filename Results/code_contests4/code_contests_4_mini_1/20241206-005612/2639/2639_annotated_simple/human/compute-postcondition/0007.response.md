The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` is the root of a binary search tree where each node contains a unique integer key in the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. After executing the function body, the behavior of the function is not specified in the output, but it is implied that it performs some operations related to the binary search tree. The function's return value is not detailed, hence it cannot be determined from the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a binary search tree node and perform operations on it, though the specific return value is unspecified.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node, which is the root of a binary search tree, and performs operations on the tree. The specific return value is unspecified.**
