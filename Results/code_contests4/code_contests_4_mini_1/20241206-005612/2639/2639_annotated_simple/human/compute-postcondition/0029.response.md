Postcondition: ***`x` is None, `y` is the last node visited, and `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree which is not None. If `y` is None, then `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, and `top` is assigned the value of `z`. If `y` is not None, then `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, and if `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`; otherwise, `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.***
