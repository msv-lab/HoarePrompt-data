The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `node`, which is the root of a binary search tree, and `key`, which is an integer constrained between -2,000,000,000 and 2,000,000,000. After executing the function body, the function will handle different cases based on the value of `node` and its relationship to `key`:

- If `node` is None, the function returns False, indicating that the node is not present in the binary search tree.
- If the key of `node` is equal to `key`, the function returns True, confirming a match.
- If `key` is less than the key of the current `node`, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with the left child of the current node and the integer `key`.
- If `key` is greater than the key of the current `node`, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with the right child of the current node and the integer `key`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to search for a given integer `key` in a binary search tree rooted at `node`, returning True if the key is found, False if the node is not present, or recursively searching in the left or right subtree based on the comparison of `key` with the current node's key.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `node` (the root of a binary search tree) and `key` (an integer). It returns False if the node is not present, True if the key matches the current node's key, or recursively searches in the left or right subtree based on the comparison of the key with the current node's key.**
