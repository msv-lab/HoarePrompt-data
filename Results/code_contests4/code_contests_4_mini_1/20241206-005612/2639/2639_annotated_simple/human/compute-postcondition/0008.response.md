The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `node`, which is the root of a binary search tree (BST). The function performs a pre-order traversal of the BST, printing the key of each node. If a node has a left child, it recursively calls itself on that left child, and similarly for the right child. This means the function will print the entire tree's keys in the order of visiting the root first, then the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.

The function does not return any value, as it is designed solely to print the keys of the nodes in the specified order. Additionally, there are no checks for null nodes, which means if `node` is `None`, an error will occur when trying to access `node.key`. This is an important edge case that is not handled in the code.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a node of a binary search tree and prints the keys of the nodes in a pre-order traversal. It does not return a value and does not handle the case where the node is None, which could lead to an error. **
