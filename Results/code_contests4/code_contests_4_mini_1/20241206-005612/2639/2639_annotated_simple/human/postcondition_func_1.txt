The function accepts a node representing the root of a binary search tree and an integer key. It returns False if the node is None, True if the key matches the key of the current node, and recursively searches in the left subtree if the key is less than the current node's key, or in the right subtree if the key is greater. If the key is not found in the tree, the function ultimately returns False.
