You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a program which performs the following operations to a binary search tree $T$ by adding the find operation to A: Binary Search Tree I.

* insert  $k$: Insert a node containing $k$ as key into $T$.
* find $k$: Report whether $T$ has a node containing $k$.
* print: Print the keys of the binary search tree by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk respectively.

Constraints

* The number of operations $\leq 500,000$
* The number of print operations $\leq 10$.
* $-2,000,000,000 \leq key \leq 2,000,000,000$
* The height of the binary tree does not exceed 100 if you employ the above pseudo code.
* The keys in the binary search tree are all different.

Input

In the first line, the number of operations $m$ is given. In the following $m$ lines, operations represented by insert $k$, find $k$ or print are given.

Output

For each find $k$ operation, print "yes" if $T$ has a node containing $k$, "no" if not.

In addition, for each print operation, print a list of keys obtained by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk in a line respectively. Put a space character before each key.

Example

Input

10
insert 30
insert 88
insert 12
insert 1
insert 20
find 12
insert 17
insert 25
find 16
print


Output

yes
no
 1 12 17 20 25 30 88
 30 12 1 20 17 25 88
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: top is the root node of a binary search tree, z is a list of operations where each operation is a string in the format of "insert k", "find k", or "print", and k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The number of operations in z does not exceed 500,000.
def func_1(top, z):
    y = None
    x = top
    while isinstance(x, Node):
        y = x
        
        if z.key < x.key:
            x = x.left
        else:
            x = x.right
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is None, `y` is the last node visited where `z.key` was less than or greater than or equal to the corresponding node's key, representing the parent of the leaf node where the search for `z.key` terminates; `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree and is not None.
    z.parent = y
    if (y is None) :
        top = z
    else :
        if (z.key < y.key) :
            y.left = z
        else :
            y.right = z
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is None, `y` is not None, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree and is not None. If `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`. If `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is None, `y` is the last node visited, and `top` remains the root node of the binary search tree which is not None. If `y` is None, then `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, and `top` is assigned the value of `z`. If `y` is not None, then `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, and if `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`; otherwise, `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.
    return top

#Function 2:

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is the root of a binary search tree where the keys are all distinct integers within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000, and the number of operations performed on the tree does not exceed 500,000.

#Function 4:

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
