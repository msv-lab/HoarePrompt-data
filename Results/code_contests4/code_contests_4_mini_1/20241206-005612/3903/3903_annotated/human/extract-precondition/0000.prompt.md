You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Iahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper. 

He writes n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and flips all values ak for which their positions are in range [i, j] (that is i ≤ k ≤ j). Flip the value of x means to apply operation x = 1 - x.

The goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). In the second line of the input there are n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. It is guaranteed that each of those n values is either 0 or 1.

Output

Print an integer — the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move. 

Examples

Input

5
1 0 0 1 0


Output

4


Input

4
1 0 0 1


Output

4

Note

In the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 5 (i = 2, j = 5). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1].

In the second case, flipping only the second and the third element (i = 2, j = 3) will turn all numbers into 1.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
