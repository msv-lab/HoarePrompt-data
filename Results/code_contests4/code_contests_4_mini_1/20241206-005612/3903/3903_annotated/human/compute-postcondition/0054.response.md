The code assigns the maximum of `maximum_count` and `count` to `maximum_count`. The previous values of `maximum_count` and `count` are used for this calculation. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, so they do not affect the output state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is at least `n`, `b` is a modified list where the values at indices from `start` to `end` have been toggled, `i` is `end`, `count` is the sum of all elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`.**
