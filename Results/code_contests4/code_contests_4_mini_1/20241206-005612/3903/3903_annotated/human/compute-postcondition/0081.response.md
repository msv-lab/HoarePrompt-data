According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `start` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `start` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to 1, and `n` is between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `start` will be increased by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is greater than `start`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
