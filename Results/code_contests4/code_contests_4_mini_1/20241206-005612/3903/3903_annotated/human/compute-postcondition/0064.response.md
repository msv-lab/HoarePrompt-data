To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we start by analyzing the initial state and the loop's behavior:

1. **Initial State**: `n` is greater than 1, `start` is equal to 1, `end` is equal to `n`, `i` is set to `end`, `count` represents the sum of all elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is updated to the greater value between its previous state and `count`, and `b` is a list derived from `a`.

2. **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates from `start` (1) to `end` (`n`), and for each iteration, the element at index `i` in the list `b` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.

After executing the loop for `n` iterations:
- The loop will execute once for each value from 1 to `n`, which means `i` will take values from 1 up to `n`.
- At each iteration, the corresponding index `i` in the list `b` will be toggled between `0` and `1`.

**Final State**: After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` (as it will increment after reaching `n`). The values in `b` will have been toggled for all indices from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `b[i]` is not modified, and `b` contains the toggled values for indices from 1 to `n`.**
