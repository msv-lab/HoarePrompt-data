The value of `b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, this means we are modifying the element at index `n` of the list `b`. The output state does not provide specific values for `b[n]`, so we cannot determine its exact new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`**
