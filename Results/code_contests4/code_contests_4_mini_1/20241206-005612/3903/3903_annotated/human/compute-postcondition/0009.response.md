According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop runs from `start` to `end`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, which means the loop has only executed for `i = 0`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, and after the current iteration, `i` will be 1. However, since `end` is 0, `i` (which will be 1) is no longer within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again unless `end` is adjusted.

To allow for one more iteration, `end` must be increased to at least 1, since `start` is already 0. 

After this adjustment, the new values will be:
- `i` will be 1 for the next iteration,
- `end` must be at least 1 to allow for `i` to be within the range.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `maximum_count` is 0, `end` is at least 1, and the first element of `b` is updated to `1 - b[0]`**
