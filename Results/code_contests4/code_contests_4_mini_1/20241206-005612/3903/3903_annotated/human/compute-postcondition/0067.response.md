Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `start` is equal to 1, and `end` is equal to `n`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `i` is set to `n + 1`, `b[i]` remains unmodified, `b` contains the toggled values for indices from 1 to `n`, `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index 1 to `n`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the greater value between its previous state and `count`.***
