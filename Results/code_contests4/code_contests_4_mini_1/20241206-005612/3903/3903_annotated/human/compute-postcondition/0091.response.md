The loop toggles the values in list `b` between 0 and 1 for indices ranging from `start` to `end`. Given the initial state, `start` is less than or equal to `end` and `end` is 1. Hence, the loop will execute at least once if `start` is 1 or 0. 

After the loop executes:

- If the loop executes once, it updates `b[start]` to `1 - b[start]`, where `start` is within the bounds of `end`.
- Since `end` is equal to 1, the value of `i` will only take the value of `start` (which can be 0 or 1), toggling `b[i]`.

If `start` is 1, the loop will toggle `b[1]`. If `start` is 0, it will toggle `b[0]`. 

Once the loop completes, the relationship between the variables is as follows:
- `n` remains between 1 and 100.
- `start` and `end` remain unchanged, with `end` still being 1.
- `b` will have its value at the index corresponding to `start` toggled.

If `start` is 1, `b[1]` will be toggled; if `start` is 0, `b[0]` will be toggled.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than or equal to `end` (which is 1), `end` is 1, `b` has its value at index `start` toggled to `1 - b[start]`**.
