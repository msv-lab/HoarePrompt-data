The code assigns a value to `b[i]` based on the current value of `b[i]`. Since `i` is 0, we are looking at the first element of the list `b`. The value of `b[i]` is modified as follows: it takes the value `1 - b[i]`. However, we do not have the initial value of `b[0]`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `b[i]` after the operation.

Assuming `b` has been initialized and is accessible, the operation will toggle `b[0]` between 0 and 1. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 0, and `b[0]` is toggled (its value changes between 0 and 1).

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 0, and `b[0]` is toggled**.
