The code compares the current value of `maximum_count` with `count` and assigns the greater of the two to `maximum_count`. Since the exact previous value of `maximum_count` is not provided and `count` is derived from the sum of the list `b` after toggling its value at index `start`, we cannot determine the new value of `maximum_count`. However, we can state that `maximum_count` is updated based on this comparison.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than or equal to `end` (which is 1), `end` is 1; `count` is the sum of the list `b` after toggling its value at index `start`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`.**
