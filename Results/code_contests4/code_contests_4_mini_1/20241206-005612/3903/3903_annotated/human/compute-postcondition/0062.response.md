According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `end` is at least `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented. Since `start` is 1, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `end` must also be at least `n + 2`, which aligns with the condition that `end` is at least `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is at least `n + 2`, `i` is `n + 2`, `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.**
