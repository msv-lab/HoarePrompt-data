According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `end`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which is within the range. The next iteration will increment `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `end`, which is 2. 

Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and the loop can execute one more time since `i` will still be less than or equal to `end`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be less than or equal to 2**
