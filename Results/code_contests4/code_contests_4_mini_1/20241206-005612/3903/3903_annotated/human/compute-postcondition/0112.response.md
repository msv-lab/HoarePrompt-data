The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The variable `i` is previously assigned the value `start + 1`, and since `start` is less than or equal to 2, `i` will be either 2 or 3. Thus, the value of `b[i]` will change based on its previous value, resulting in `b[i]` being either `1 - b[2]` or `1 - b[3]`. The output state will reflect the possible changes in `b[i]` but does not provide specific values for `b[2]` or `b[3]` since they are not defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100; `end` is 2; `start` is less than or equal to 2; `i` is `start + 1`; `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.**
