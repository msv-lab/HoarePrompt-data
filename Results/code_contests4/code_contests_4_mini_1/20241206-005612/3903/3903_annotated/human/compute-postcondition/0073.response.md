The value of `b[i]` is assigned the result of `1 - b[i]`. Since `i` is 2, the value of `b[2]` will be toggled from its previous value. The other variables `n`, `start`, `end`, and `i` do not affect the operation of this line. The loop will not execute again because `i` is greater than `end`, which is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is toggled from its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is toggled from its previous value.**
