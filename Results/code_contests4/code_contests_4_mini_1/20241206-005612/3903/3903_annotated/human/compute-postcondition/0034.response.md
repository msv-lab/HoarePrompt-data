`b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`. Since `i` is 1, we need to evaluate `b[1]`. Given that `b[1]` is toggled, it means that if `b[1]` is currently 0, it will become 1, and if it is currently 1, it will become 0. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `b[1]`, only that it is toggled. Therefore, we will represent the output state based on the toggling effect.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 1, `b[1]` is toggled (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0)**
