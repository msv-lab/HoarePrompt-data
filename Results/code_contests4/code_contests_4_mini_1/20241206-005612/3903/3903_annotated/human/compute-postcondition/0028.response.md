Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100; `start` is 0; `end` is 1. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b` is a list with toggled values of its initial elements, `count` is the sum of the toggled values of `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
