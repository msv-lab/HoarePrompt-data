The code assigns `maximum_count` the maximum value between its current value and `count`. The value of `count` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The value of `maximum_count` is affected by this operation, but we don't have the initial value of `maximum_count`, so we cannot determine its final state. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `maximum_count` is updated based on the maximum comparison.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100; `start` is 0; `end` is 2; `count` is the sum of toggled values of `b[0]`, `b[1]`, `b[2]` which can be 0, 1, 2, or 3; `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.**
