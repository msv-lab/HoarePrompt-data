According to the code, the loop will execute a number of times determined by the values of `start` and `end`. Specifically, the loop will iterate from `start` (0) to `end + 1` (3), which means it will execute for `i` values of 0, 1, and 2. 

The variable `n` being between 1 and 100 does not directly affect the execution of the loop, but it may be relevant to the context of the program. The variable `b` being a list created from `a` does not influence the execution of the loop either.

At the start of the loop:
- `i` will begin at 0 for the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the relevant states to mention are `i` starting at 0 and the range for `i` being defined by `start` and `end`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
