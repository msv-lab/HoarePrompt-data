According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `end` and `n`. If `end` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is at least 0 and `n` is between 1 and 100. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `end` must be increased by 1. Therefore, the new value of `end` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `end` must remain less than `n`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
