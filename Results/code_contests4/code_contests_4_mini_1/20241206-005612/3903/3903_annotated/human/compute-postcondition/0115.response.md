To analyze the loop's behavior, we note that it iterates from `start` to `end`, inclusive, and toggles the values of `b[i]` between 0 and 1. Given that `n` is between 1 and 100, `end` is 2, and `start` is less than or equal to 2, we can deduce the following:

1. If `start` is 1, the loop will execute for `i = 1` and `i = 2`.
2. If `start` is 0, the loop will execute for `i = 0`, `i = 1`, and `i = 2`.
3. If `start` is greater than `end`, the loop won't execute.

Since `end` is 2, the maximum value of `i` during the loop iterations will be 2. After all iterations, the values of `b` at indices from `start` to `end` will have been toggled.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will depend on the starting point and the original values of `b`. However, since we are focusing on the relationships and values rather than the specifics of the toggling, we can summarize the final state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100; `end` is 2; `start` is less than or equal to 2; `b[i]` is toggled for each `i` from `start` to `end`.**
