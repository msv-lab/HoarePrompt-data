The value of `b[i]` is updated by taking `1 - b[i]`. The current value of `i` is 2, so `b[2]` is affected. The value of `b` at index 2 is not specified, but the operation will toggle its value between 0 and 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is toggled.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is toggled.**
