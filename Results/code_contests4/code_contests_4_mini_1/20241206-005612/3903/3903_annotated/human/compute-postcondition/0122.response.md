The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. After executing the function body, the output is implied to be based on the values of `n` and `a`, though it is not explicitly given in the output. However, we can infer the functionality based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1).**
