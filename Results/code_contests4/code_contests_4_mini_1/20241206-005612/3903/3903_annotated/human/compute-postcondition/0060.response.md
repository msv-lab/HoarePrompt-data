According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop executes for values of `i` starting from `start` and going up to `end` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, we have `start` as 1, `end` as `n`, and `i` as `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `i` is currently `n`, it will become `n + 1`. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than or equal to `end`, which is `n`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `end` must be greater than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is at least `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]**
