According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Given that `n` is between 1 and 100, the loop will execute for values of `end` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` will be `n - 1`. Since `start` is initialized to 0 and `maximum_count` is initialized to 0, these variables do not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `end` must be 0 (the initial value) and `n` must be between 1 and 100.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `maximum_count` is 0, `end` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
