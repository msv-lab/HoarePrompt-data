To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we analyze the provided loop code and its impact on the variables based on the initial state and the output states after several iterations.

1. The loop runs from `start` to `end`, inclusive. Given that `start` is 0 and `end` is at least 0 (as established in the provided output states), the loop will execute at least once if `end` is 0, and potentially more times if `end` is greater than 0.
2. During each iteration, the value of `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1 using the expression `b[i] = 1 - b[i]`.
3. After each iteration, the values of `n`, `start`, `maximum_count`, and `end` remain unchanged as none of them are modified within the loop.

Given that the loop toggles the values of elements in the list `b` from `start` to `end`, we can summarize the final state after all iterations:

- If `end` is 0, then only `b[0]` will be toggled once.
- If `end` is greater than 0, all elements from `b[0]` to `b[end]` will be toggled.

Since `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `maximum_count` is 0, and `end` must be at least 0 (and can be greater), we conclude:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `maximum_count` is 0, `end` is at least 0, and the elements of `b` from index `start` to `end` have been toggled (i.e., `b[i]` is `1 - b[i]` for each i in the range from `start` to `end`).**
