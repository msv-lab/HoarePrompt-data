The code `maximum_count = max(maximum_count, count)` assigns `maximum_count` the maximum value between its current value and `count`. The previous values of `maximum_count` and `count` are not specified, but `count` represents the sum of the updated `b` and `maximum_count` is a variable that can hold any value. Since `count` is the sum of the updated `b`, it is likely that `count` has a positive value based on the context.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 2, `b[1]` is toggled, `count` is the sum of the updated `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 2, `b[1]` is toggled, `count` is the sum of the updated `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.**
