The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The previous value of `b[i]` is not specified, but it will be toggled between 0 and 1. The other variables `n`, `end`, `start`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100; `end` is at least 3; `start` is at most 2; `i` is 3; `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100; `end` is at least 3; `start` is at most 2; `i` is 3; `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.**
