According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `end` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is 1, meaning that the loop has executed for `end` values of 0 and 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `end` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `end` will become 2. Additionally, since `n` is between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
