The code `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` modifies the value at index `i` in the list `b`. The value of `i` is given as 1. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `b[i]`, but since `n` is greater than 1, `b` must be defined and must have at least 2 elements (0 and 1 indices). The value of `b[1]` will be replaced by `1 - b[1]`. 

Assuming `b[1]` has a value (unknown from the initial state), the operation will toggle its value between 0 and 1. However, since we don't have the specific initial value of `b[1]`, we cannot determine the exact new value after the operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 1, and `b[1]` is toggled from its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 1, and `b[1]` is toggled from its previous value.**
