The value of `b[i]` is assigned the value of `1 - b[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, we update `b[2]` to `1 - b[2]`. The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `b`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `b[2]` based on its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is at least 2, `b` is a modified list with `b[1]` updated to 1 - b[1], `b[2]` is updated to 1 - b[2], `i` is 2**
