To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, let's analyze the provided initial conditions and the code.

Initial State: `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `b` is a list created from `a` where `b[0]` is toggled from its initial value and `b[1]` is toggled from its initial value.

The code `count = sum(b)` computes the sum of the elements in the list `b`. The values of `b` depend on how it was created from `a` and which values were toggled, but since the exact initial values of `b[0]` and `b[1]` are not specified, we can only express the resultant state in terms of their toggled values. 

If we assume the initial values of `b[0]` and `b[1]` were both 0, toggling them would change them to 1. Therefore, their sum would be 2. However, since we do not know the exact initial values of `b`, we cannot specify an exact numerical value for `count`.

Thus, the output state considering `b` has two elements that were toggled is:
- If `b[0]` and `b[1]` were initially 0, then `count` would be 2.
- If they were initially 1, then `count` would be 0.
- If they were initially different (e.g., `b[0]` is 0 and `b[1]` is 1), then `count` would be 1.

Since the exact initial values are not provided, we express the output state in a general form.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 1; `b` is a list with toggled values of its initial elements; `count` is the sum of the toggled values of `b`.**
