The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. Since `i` is 0, this means we are modifying the first element of the list `b`. The previous value of `b[0]` is unknown, but it will be flipped (0 becomes 1 or 1 becomes 0). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `maximum_count` is 0, `end` is 0, and the first element of `b` is updated to `1 - b[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `maximum_count` is 0, `end` is 0, and the first element of `b` is updated to `1 - b[0]**.
