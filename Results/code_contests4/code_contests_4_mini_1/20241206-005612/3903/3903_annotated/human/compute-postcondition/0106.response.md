Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than or equal to `end` (which is 1), and `end` is 2. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `i` has iterated from `start` to `end`, `count` is the sum of `b[1]` and `b[2]`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`.***
