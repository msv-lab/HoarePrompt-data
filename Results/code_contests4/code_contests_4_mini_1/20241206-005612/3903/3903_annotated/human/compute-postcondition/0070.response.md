According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop will execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. In this case, `start` is equal to 1 and `end` is also equal to 1, which means the loop will execute exactly once. 

However, `i` is initialized to `n + 1`, which is not relevant for the loop's execution since `i` will be set by the loop itself. The loop will start with `i` equal to `start`, which is 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `start` is 1
- `end` is 1
- `i` will be set to 1 when the loop begins.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1**
