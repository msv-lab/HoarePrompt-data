The code assigns the maximum value between `maximum_count` and `count` to `maximum_count`. The values of `maximum_count` and `count` are compared, but since their previous values are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `b[i]` is not modified, `b` contains the toggled values for indices from 1 to `n`, `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index 1 to `n`, and we update `maximum_count` to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.
