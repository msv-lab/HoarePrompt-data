Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `start` is equal to 1, and `end` is equal to 1. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b[1]` is toggled, `count` becomes the sum of the updated values in `b` from index 1 to `n`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
