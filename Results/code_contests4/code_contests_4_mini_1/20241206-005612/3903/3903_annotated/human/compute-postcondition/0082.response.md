According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, the loop will definitely execute at least once. However, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

The variable `end` is initialized at 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After the first execution, `end` will be 1. For the loop to execute the second time, `end` will be 1, and `n` must be at least 3 (greater than 2). 

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute a second time are that `n` is at least 3 and `end` is 1 after the first iteration.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2, `end` is 1**
