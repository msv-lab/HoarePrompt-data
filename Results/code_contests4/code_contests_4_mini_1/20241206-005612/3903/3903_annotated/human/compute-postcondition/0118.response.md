Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `end` is 2, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is less than or equal to 2, then `count` is the sum of the elements in `b` from the index `start` to `end`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
