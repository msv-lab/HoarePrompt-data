The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, modifying the elements of the list `b` based on their current values. Each element `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1. 

Given that the initial state indicates `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, and `b` is a list created from `a`, the loop will execute exactly two times, changing the values of `b[0]` and `b[1]` accordingly.

1. After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `b[0]` becomes `1 - b[0]`.
2. After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `b[1]` becomes `1 - b[1]`.

By the end of the loop, both `b[0]` and `b[1]` will have been toggled from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `b` is a list created from `a` where `b[0]` is toggled from its initial value and `b[1]` is toggled from its initial value.**
