The code snippet `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` assigns the variable `a` the result of mapping the `int` function over the input received from `raw_input()`, which splits the input string into a list of substrings. The value of `n` does not directly affect this operation. The output state reflects that `a` is now a map object that contains integers derived from the input but does not specify the exact contents of `a` because they depend on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a map of integers from user input.**
