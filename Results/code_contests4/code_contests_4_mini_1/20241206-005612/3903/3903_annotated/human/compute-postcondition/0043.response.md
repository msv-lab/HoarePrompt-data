According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `end` takes values from the range defined by `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, the loop will execute at least once. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1, which is already stated in the provided conditions. 

At the start of the loop, `end` will begin at 0 for its first execution. When the loop executes a second time, `end` will be 1. Therefore, the variables to consider are `n` (which must be greater than 1 for the second execution) and `end` (which will be 1 after the first execution).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
