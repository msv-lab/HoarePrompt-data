The value at index `i` of the list `b` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The previous state indicates that `i` is 1, so the operation affects the element at index 1 of the list `b`. The exact value of `b[1]` is not specified, but the new value will be the result of `1 - b[1]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `b` is a modified list where b[1] is updated to 1 - b[1], `i` is 1**
