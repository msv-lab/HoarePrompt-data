According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `end` and the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates with `end` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is currently 1, and since `n` is between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

At the start of the next iteration, `end` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `end` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than or equal to `end` (which is 1), `end` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2**
