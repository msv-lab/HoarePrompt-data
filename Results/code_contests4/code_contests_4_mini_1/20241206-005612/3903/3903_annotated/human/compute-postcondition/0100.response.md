The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, so the code modifies `b[2]`. The previous value of `b[2]` is unknown since it is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `b[2]` after the operation. However, the operation itself will toggle the value of `b[2]` between 0 and 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 1, `end` is 2, `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
