`b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`. The value of `i` is 3, so we are toggling the value of `b[3]`. The previous value of `b[3]` is unknown, but it will change from either 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. The states of the other variables `n`, `start`, `end`, and `b[2]` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 1, `end` is at least 3, `i` is 3, and `b[3]` is toggled (changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 1, `end` is at least 3, `i` is 3, and `b[3]` is toggled (changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0)**.
