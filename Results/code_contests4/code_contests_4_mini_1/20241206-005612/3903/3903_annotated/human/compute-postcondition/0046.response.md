According to the code, the loop execution depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The range function is called with `start` and `end + 1`. For the loop to execute, `start` must be less than or equal to `end`. 

In this case, `start` is 1 and `end` is also 1, which means the loop will execute for `i` equal to 1 (since `range(1, 2)` generates the sequence [1]). 

Thus, the states do not need to be adjusted because they already meet the necessary conditions for the loop to execute at least once. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `b` is a list copy of `a`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
