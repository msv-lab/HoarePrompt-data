According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `end` in relation to `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n`, which means it can execute as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `end` is currently 1, and `n` is between 1 and 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `end` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `end` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
