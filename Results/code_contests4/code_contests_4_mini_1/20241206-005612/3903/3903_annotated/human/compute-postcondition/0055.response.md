Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `start` is equal to 1, and `end` is at least `n`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the list `b` is modified by toggling the values at indices from `start` to `end`, `i` is set to `end`, `count` represents the sum of all elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the greater value between its previous state and `count`.***
