The code `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` modifies the value of `b` at the index `i`. The current value of `i` is 1, and `b` is a list created from `a`. However, we do not have the specific values of `b` or `a`. The value at index 1 of list `b` will be updated to `1 - b[1]`. 

Since we don't know the specific value of `b[1]`, we cannot determine the exact outcome. Therefore, we note that `b[i]` is changed but the specific values remain unknown. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `b` is a list created from `a`, `i` is 1, and `b[i]` is changed to `1 - b[1]`.**
