The `maximum_count` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `count`. The value of `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from index `start` to `end`, but we do not have specific details about `b`, `start`, or `end`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `maximum_count` may increase but specific values are not provided.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `maximum_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `count`, `end` is at least 0, and `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from index `start` to `end.**
