According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is specified to be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once because the range will be from 0 to n-1. The variable `start` will take on values from 0 up to n-1 during the iterations. 

At the start of the loop, `maximum_count` is 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution; it simply holds a value that may be used within the loop body. The initial state of `a` as a map of integers from user input does not influence the loop's execution either, unless specific operations on the map are intended within the loop body.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we only need to confirm that `n` is between 1 and 100, which is already given.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is 0, `maximum_count` is 0**
