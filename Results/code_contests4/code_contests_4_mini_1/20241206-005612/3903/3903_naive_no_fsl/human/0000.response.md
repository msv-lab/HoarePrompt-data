Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where all elements are `1`. In this situation, if Iahub flips any segment of the array, the total number of `1`s will be decreased. For example, if the input is:

```
3
1 1 1
```

The program will compute the maximum number of `1`s after performing a flip, which will always be less than `3`, as flipping any segment will convert some `1`s to `0`s. The correct output in this case should be `2`, since Iahub must perform exactly one move. 

The program needs to account for this edge case and ensure that the output reflects the maximum possible number of `1`s after exactly one flip, even if flipping reduces the total count of `1`s. Hence, the program is incorrect.
