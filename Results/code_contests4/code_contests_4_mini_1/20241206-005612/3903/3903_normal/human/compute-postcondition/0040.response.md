Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is 0; `end` is `n`; `count` is the sum of the toggled elements in `b`; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b` contains the toggled values from its initial state, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
