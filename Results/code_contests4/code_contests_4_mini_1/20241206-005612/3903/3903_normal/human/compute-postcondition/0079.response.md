Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is a valid integer such that `start` ≤ `k + 2;` `end` is `k + 2;` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `i` is set to `end`, `count` is the sum of the toggled values in `b`, and `maximum_count` may be updated to the maximum of its current value and `count`.***
