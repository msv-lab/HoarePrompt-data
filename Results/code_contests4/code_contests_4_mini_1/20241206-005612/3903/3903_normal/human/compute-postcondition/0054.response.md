The value of `count` remains unchanged, but we check the maximum between `maximum_count` and `count` and assign the result to `maximum_count`. The previous values of `maximum_count` and `count` are not specified, but `maximum_count` is updated to be the greater of the two. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is unchanged, `end` is unchanged, `b[i]` for `i` in range from `start` to `end` is toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.
