The value of `b[i]` is toggled, where `i` is 1. Since `b[i]` is initially 1 (as per the initial state), the new value of `b[1]` will be `1 - 1`, which equals 0. The values of `n`, `maximum_count`, `start`, and `end` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `b[1]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `b[1]` is 0**
