The value of `b[i]` is toggled from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1. Since `i` is 1, the element at index 1 in the list `b` is affected. The initial state does not specify the current value of `b[1]`, but since `b` is a copy of `a`, we can determine the effect based on the toggling operation. 

If `b[1]` was 1, it becomes 0. If it was 0, it becomes 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as their values are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the toggled value of `b[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `end` is at least 1, `start` is 0, `count` is the sum of the final toggled elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of all possible toggled arrays `b` computed during the iterations, `b` is a list copied from `a`, `k` is -1 or less; element `b[1]` is toggled from its previous value.**
