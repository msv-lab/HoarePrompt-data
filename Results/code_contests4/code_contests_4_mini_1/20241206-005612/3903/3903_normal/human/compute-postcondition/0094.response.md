Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `end` is 0, and `start` is at least 0. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, which is a list copied from `a` with `b[0]` toggled. The `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`, and `k` is -1 or less.***
