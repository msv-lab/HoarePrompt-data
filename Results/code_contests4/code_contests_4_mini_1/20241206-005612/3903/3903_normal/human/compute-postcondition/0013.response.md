To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the code and the initial conditions.

The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, toggling the values in the list `b` at each index `i`. The output states after the first few iterations indicate that for each iteration, the value of `b[i]` at the current index `i` is changed from its original value to `1 - b[i]`.

1. If `start = 0` and `end = 0`, the loop will execute once, toggling `b[0]`.
2. If `start = 0` and `end = 1`, the loop will execute twice, toggling both `b[0]` and `b[1]`.
3. If `start = 0` and `end = 2`, the loop will execute three times, toggling `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]`.

Assuming that the loop executes from `start` to `end`, if `end` is equal to `n - 1`, the loop will toggle all values from `b[0]` up to `b[n - 1]`.

If we denote the original state of the list `b` as `b_original`, after the loop executes for all indices from `start` to `end`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- The values in `b` at indices from `start` to `end` will be the result of toggling the original values of `b` at those indices.
- If `end` is less than `start`, the loop will not execute, and `b` will remain unchanged.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), we can conclude that, assuming the loop runs to its maximum extent with `start = 0` and `end = n - 1`, each element in the list `b` will be toggled.

Therefore, if the loop executes completely with valid `start` and `end` values such that `end` is at least `start` and `end` is less than `n`, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at most `n - 1`, `b` contains the toggled values of the original list.**
