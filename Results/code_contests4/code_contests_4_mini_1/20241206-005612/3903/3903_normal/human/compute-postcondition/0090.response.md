The value of `b[i]` is updated by toggling its previous value, which means if `b[i]` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. Given that `i` is 1, we are toggling `b[1]`. The specific previous value of `b[1]` is not provided, but it will change from its initial state.

Since `b` is a list copied from `a`, its values depend on the initial state of `a`. However, we know that `b[1]` is toggled. After this operation, the other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `end` is at least 1, `start` is 0, `count` is the sum of the final toggled elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is the maximum sum of all possible toggled arrays `b` computed during the iterations, `k` is -1 or less; `b` has `b[1]` toggled from its previous value.
