According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the range defined by `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `end` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is `k + 1`. Given that `k + 1` is less than `n`, it means that the loop can execute again. After the last iteration, `end` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` will be `k + 2`, and `n` remains unchanged as it is still valid since `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is `k + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `end` must be less than `n`.**
