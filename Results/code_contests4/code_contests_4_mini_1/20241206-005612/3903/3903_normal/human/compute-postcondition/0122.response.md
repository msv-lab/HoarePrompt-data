The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `a`. The integer `n` is constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` contains `n` integers, and each integer in the list is either 0 or 1. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on certain conditions, which are not specified in detail. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and a list of `n` integers consisting of 0s and 1s. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.**
