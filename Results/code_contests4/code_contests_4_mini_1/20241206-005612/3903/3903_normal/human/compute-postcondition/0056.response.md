According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 1`, meaning it can execute as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to increase by 1.

Since `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, if `end` is currently `k`, then for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `end` will become `k + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` remains unchanged, and `end` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**
