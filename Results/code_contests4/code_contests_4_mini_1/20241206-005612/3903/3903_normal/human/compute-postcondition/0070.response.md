According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop will execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, which means `i` will take values starting from `start` up to `end` (inclusive). Given that `end` is defined as `k + 2`, if `start` is less than or equal to `k + 2`, the loop can execute.

Since `n` is an integer with a range of 1 to 100 and does not affect the loop execution directly, it remains unchanged.

At the first execution of the loop, `i` will be equal to `start`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` is defined properly within the range of `end`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is a valid integer such that `start` ≤ `k + 2;` `end` is `k + 2;` `i` is `start`**
