The loop toggles the values of the list `b` from index `start` to `end`, inclusive. Given the initial state constraints, `end` can be at least `0` and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. After the loop completes all iterations from `start` to `end`, each element `b[i]` in that range will have been toggled a number of times equal to one more than the initial value (0 or 1), effectively changing it to the opposite value. 

If `start` is equal to `end`, the loop will execute once (toggling `b[start]`). If `start` is less than `end`, the loop will execute `(end - start + 1)` times, toggling each `b[i]` for `i` from `start` to `end`.

Therefore, after the loop executes completely, the relevant variables will be:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `start` is unchanged.
- `end` is unchanged.
- Each `b[i]` for `i` from `start` to `end` will contain the toggled values (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).

If `start` is greater than `end`, the loop does not execute and the values of `b` remain unchanged in that range.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is unchanged, `end` is unchanged, and `b[i]` for `i` in range from `start` to `end` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
