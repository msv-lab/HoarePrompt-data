The value of `b[i]` is changed to `1 - b[i]`. Given that `b[i]` can be either 0 or 1, if `b[i]` is 0, it will become 1, and if `b[i]` is 1, it will become 0. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged, but we know that `b[i]` is flipped. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `b[i]` is either 0 or 1 (now flipped).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `b[i]` is either 0 or 1 (now flipped).**
