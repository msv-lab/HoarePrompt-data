The loop toggles the values of the elements in the list `b` from indices `start` to `end` inclusive. Given that `end` is `k + 1` and `start` is unchanged, the loop will execute for a total of `end - start + 1` iterations. 

After all iterations of the loop have completed:
- Each element `b[i]` for `i` from `start` to `end` will have been toggled, meaning if it was initially 0, it will be 1 and vice versa.
- The values of `n`, `start`, and `end` will remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is unchanged; `end` is `k + 1; b` contains the elements toggled between 0 and 1 from indices `start` to `end`.**
