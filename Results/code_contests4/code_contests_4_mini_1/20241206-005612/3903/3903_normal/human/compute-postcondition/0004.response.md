According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, it guarantees that `n` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute. For the first iteration of the loop, the variable `end` will take the value of 0. The `maximum_count` and `start` variables do not affect the loop's ability to execute. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `end` should be initialized to 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
