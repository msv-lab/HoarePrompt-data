The code creates a new list `b` that is a copy of the list `a`. However, since the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `a`, we cannot determine its value. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state must reflect this uncertainty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0; variable `b` is a copy of an unknown list `a`.**
