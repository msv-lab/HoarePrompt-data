Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is 0; `end` is `n - 1`; `b` is an array of length `n`; `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`, which can range from 0 to `n`; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`***.
