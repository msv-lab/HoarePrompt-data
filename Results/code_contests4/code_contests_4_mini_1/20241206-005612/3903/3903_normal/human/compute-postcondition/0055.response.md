Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` remains unchanged, and `end` remains unchanged. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b[i]` for `i` in the range from `start` to `end` is toggled between 0 and 1, `count` becomes the sum of the elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
