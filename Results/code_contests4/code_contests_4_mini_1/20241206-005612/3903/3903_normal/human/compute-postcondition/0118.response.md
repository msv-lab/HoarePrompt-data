Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `end` is 2, `start` is at least 0, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `count`, `k` remains -1 or less; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is now a list containing elements of `a` with the elements at indices 0, 1, and 2 toggled, and `i` is not defined as the loop has finished executing.***
