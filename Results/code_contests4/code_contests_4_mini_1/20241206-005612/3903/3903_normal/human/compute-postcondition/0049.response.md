`b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`, where `i` is currently 1. The value of `b[1]` is toggled between 0 and 1. Since `b[0]` is not specified, we assume it is not affected. The output state reflects the change in `b[1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `i` is 1, and `b[1]` is toggled between 0 and 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `i` is 1, and `b[1]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
