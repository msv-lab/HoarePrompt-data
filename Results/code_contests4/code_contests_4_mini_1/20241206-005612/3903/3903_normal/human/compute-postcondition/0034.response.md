The code `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` updates the value at index `i` of the list `b`. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `b[1]` will be toggled between 0 and 1. Since the values of `b` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact previous value of `b[1]`. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `b[1]` is updated but we cannot specify its new value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is `n`, `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`, `b[0]` is updated to `1 - b[0]`, `i` is 1; `b[1]` is updated to `1 - b[1]`.**
