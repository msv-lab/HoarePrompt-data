According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the condition of the range defined by `n`. The loop is set to execute for each value of `end` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` would have taken a value of `end - 1`. 

Since the loop iterates with `end` starting from 0 and ending at `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, if `end` is currently `k`, then `k` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute again, making the next value of `end` equal to `k + 1`.

Given that `start` is 0 and `end` is at most `n - 1`, the new state should reflect the incremented value of `end`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is the current value plus 1 (at most `n - 1`), and for the loop to execute a second time `end` must be less than `n`**
