`maximum_count` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `count`. The previous value of `maximum_count` is 0, and `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`, which is not specified but is a non-negative integer since `b` contains elements. Therefore, `maximum_count` will be updated to either 0 or the value of `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or the value of `count`, `start` is 0, `end` is at most `n - 1`, and `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`.**
