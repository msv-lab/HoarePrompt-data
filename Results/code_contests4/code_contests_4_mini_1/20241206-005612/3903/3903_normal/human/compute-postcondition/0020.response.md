The variable `b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`. The value of `b[i]` depends on the previous value of `b[i]`, which is unknown, but it will change from whatever it was to `1 - b[i]`. The values of the other variables `n`, `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 0 (up to `n - 1`), `i` is 0, and `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 0 (up to `n - 1`), `i` is 0, and `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`**.
