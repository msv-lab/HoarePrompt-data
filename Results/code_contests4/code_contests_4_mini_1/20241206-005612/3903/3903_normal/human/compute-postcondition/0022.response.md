The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The previous value of `b[i]` is not specified, but it can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, if `b[i]` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `b[i]` is either 0 or 1, flipped.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `b[i]` is either 0 or 1, flipped.**
