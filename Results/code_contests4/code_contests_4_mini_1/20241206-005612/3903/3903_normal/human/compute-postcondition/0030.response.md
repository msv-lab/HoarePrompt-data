The variable `b` is assigned the value of `list(a)`, indicating that `b` is now a list created from the variable `a`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `a`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values that `b` will hold after this operation. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `count` remain unchanged, and the range of `b` is dependent on the contents of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is 0; `end` is `n`; `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`; `b` is assigned the value of `list(a)` which is unknown.**
