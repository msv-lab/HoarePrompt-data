The variable `maximum_count` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables, `n` and `a`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is assigned a mapped list of integers from input, where each integer is either 0 or 1; `maximum_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is assigned a mapped list of integers from input, where each integer is either 0 or 1; `maximum_count` is 0**
