According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `start` should be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the range of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
