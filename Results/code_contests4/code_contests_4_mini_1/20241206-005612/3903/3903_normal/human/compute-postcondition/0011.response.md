According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `start` and `end + 1`. The `start` is 0 and `end` is 1, which means the loop will iterate for `i` values of 0 and 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be at its maximum value, which is 1. 

Since the loop iterates from `start` (0) to `end` (1), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. However, since `i` has already reached `end` (which is 1), the loop cannot execute again as there are no valid values for `i` beyond 1 within the specified range.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, the `end` should be incremented. If the `end` is increased to 2, then `i` can take the value 2 in the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `b[1]` is 0**
