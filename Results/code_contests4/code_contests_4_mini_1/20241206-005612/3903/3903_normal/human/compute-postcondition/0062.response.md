According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `start + 1`, which is also less than or equal to `k + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `start + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `start + 2` must be less than or equal to `end`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is less than or equal to `k + 1; i` is `start + 2; for the loop to execute again, `end` must be greater than or equal to `start + 2`**
