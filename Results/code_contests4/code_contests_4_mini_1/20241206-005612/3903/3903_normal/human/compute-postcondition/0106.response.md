Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `end` is 1, `start` is at least 0, and `count` is the sum of elements in `b`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b` is a list that is a copy of `a` with toggled values for `b[start]` and `b[end]` (if `start` and `end` are within the bounds of the list), and `count` is updated to the sum of elements in `b`. The `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`, and `k` remains -1 or less.***
