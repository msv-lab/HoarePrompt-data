According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The variable `start` is initialized to 0, and `end` is defined as the current value plus 1, which is at most `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `end` must be at least equal to `start`, which is 0. 

Given the conditions:
- `start` is 0.
- `end` must be at least 0, which it is since it can be at most `n - 1` (and `n` is at least 1).

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once:
- `start` is 0.
- `end` must be at least 0, which it is.

When the loop starts, `i` will have the initial value of `start`, which is 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 0 (up to `n - 1`), `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
