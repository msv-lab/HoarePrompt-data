The value of `b[i]` is updated by toggling it between 0 and 1. Since `i` is 2, the assignment affects `b[2]`. However, the initial value of `b[2]` is not provided, so we can only state that it will change from its current value to the opposite value (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is toggled.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is toggled.**
