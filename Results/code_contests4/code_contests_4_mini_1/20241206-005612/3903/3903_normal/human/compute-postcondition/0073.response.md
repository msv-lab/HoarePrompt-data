The code toggles the value of `b[i]` between 0 and 1. The previous value of `b[i]` is not specified, but it can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, after the execution, if `b[i]` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is a valid integer such that `start` ≤ `k + 2;` `end` is `k + 2;` `i` is `start + 1`; `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
