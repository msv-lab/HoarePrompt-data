According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `start` and `end`. For the loop to execute at least once, the `start` must be less than or equal to `end`. Given the initial state where `start` is less than or equal to `end` and `end` is 0, the only scenario where the loop can execute is if `start` is 0. If `start` is negative or greater than `end`, the loop will not execute. 

Since `n` is an integer that is constrained between 1 and 100, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop in this context. The critical states to ensure the loop executes are that `start` must be 0 (or any value less than or equal to `end` which is 0), and `i` should be initialized to `start` which is 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is 0, `start` is 0, and for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0.**
