Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. It calculates the maximum number of integers in the list that can be set to 1 by toggling a contiguous subarray of the list. The function outputs this maximum count. **
