`b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but since it is likely an index within the bounds of the array `b`, we can deduce that `b[1]` will be affected. Given that `b[1]` is currently 0, the calculation becomes `b[1] = 1 - 0`, which results in `b[1]` being updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `b[1]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `b[1]` is 1**
