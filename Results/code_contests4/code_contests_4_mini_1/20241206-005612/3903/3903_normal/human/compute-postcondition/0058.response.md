According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variables `start` and `end`. The loop will execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Here, `end` is defined as `k + 1`, which means that `k` needs to be at least `start - 1` for the loop to run. 

Additionally, the variable `i` will start at the value of `start` and will increment by 1 until it reaches `end`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes for the first time, `start` must be less than or equal to `end`, and `i` should be initialized to `start`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to establish:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 (this state is already defined and doesn't need adjustment).
- `start` should be less than or equal to `end` (which is `k + 1`).
- `i` is initialized to `start`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is less than or equal to `k + 1, i` is `start`**
