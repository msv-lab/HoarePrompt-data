The line of code `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` modifies the value at index `i` of the list `b`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, which means this code will affect the first element of the list `b`. However, since the initial values of `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific value that will be assigned to `b[0]`. The value will be toggled between 0 and 1.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the first element of `b` has been toggled, but we cannot specify its final value without knowing its initial value. The output state will indicate the change made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is 0, `start` is 0, `i` is 0, and `b[0]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
