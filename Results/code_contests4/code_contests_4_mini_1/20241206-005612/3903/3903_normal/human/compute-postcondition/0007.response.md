According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop will only execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Given the current state where `start` is 0 and `end` is also 0, the loop can execute once since it will iterate from `start` (0) to `end` (0), inclusive. The loop variable `i` will take the value of 0 during the first iteration. 

The value of `n` and `maximum_count` does not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute in this context. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we can keep the states as they are, and note that `i` will be 0 for the first execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
