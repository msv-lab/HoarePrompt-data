Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` remains unchanged; `end` is `k + 1`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the array `b` contains the elements toggled between 0 and 1 from indices `start` to `end`; `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`; `maximum_count` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `count`.***
