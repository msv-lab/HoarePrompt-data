The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1), and computes the maximum number of 1's in the list that can be achieved by toggling any contiguous subarray. It returns this maximum count as output. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid or outside the specified range for `n`.
