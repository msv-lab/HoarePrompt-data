To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial conditions:

1. The loop iterates from `start` to `end`. 
2. Each iteration updates `b[i]` to `1 - b[i]`, effectively toggling the value at index `i` in the list `b`.

Given that `n` is between 1 and 100, and `start` is less than `n`, we can deduce the following:

- The loop will execute for each integer `i` starting from `start` up to and including `end`.
- If `end` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute `end - start + 1` times.

From the output states provided:
- After 1 iteration, `b[1]` is toggled.
- After 2 iterations, `b[1]` is toggled again, and if `end` is at least 2, `b[2]` would be toggled as well.
- If `end` is 2, the loop execution stops after toggling `b[1]` and `b[2]`. If `end` is greater than 2, the loop will not execute for `i` greater than `end`.

To summarize, after all iterations of the loop, the values of `b` for indices from `start` to `end` will have their states toggled. 

Output State: **`b` is updated such that `b[i]` is toggled for each `i` from `start` to `end`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, and `end` is at least `start`.**
