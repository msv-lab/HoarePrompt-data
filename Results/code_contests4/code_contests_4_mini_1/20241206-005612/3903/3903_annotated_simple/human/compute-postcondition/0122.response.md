The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on two implicit inputs: `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), and a list \( a1, a2, \ldots, an \) containing \( n \) integers, each of which is either 0 or 1. 

The function's output is determined by the values in the list. Specifically:

- If the list contains only 0s, the function returns a specific message or value indicating that.
- If the list contains only 1s, the function returns a different specific message or value indicating that.
- If the list contains a mix of 0s and 1s, the function returns another specific message or value indicating that.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer \( n \) and a list of integers of length \( n \) (where each integer is either 0 or 1) and return different messages based on the composition of the list. 

Functionality: **The function processes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers (each either 0 or 1), returning specific messages based on whether the list contains only 0s, only 1s, or a mix of both.**
