The value of `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]`, where `i` is 1. This means that if `b[1]` was 0, it will become 1, and if it was 1, it will become 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` remains as it is from the last iteration; `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from `start` to `end`; `start` is 0; `end` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time; `b[1]` is toggled.
