According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `end` and the upper limit `n`. The loop iterates as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is equal to some value that is currently less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `end` must increase by 1.

Given that `end` is currently less than `n`, the next value of `end` will be `end + 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `end` must be updated accordingly, and it must still satisfy the condition of being less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is currently less than `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `end` must be `end + 1` which is still less than `n`**
