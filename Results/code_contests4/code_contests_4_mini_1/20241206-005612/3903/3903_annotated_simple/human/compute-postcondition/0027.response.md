The value of `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `count`. The previous value of `maximum_count` is either 0 or the current value of `count`. The value of `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`, which toggles between 0 and 1 for each index from `start` to `n`. Therefore, `maximum_count` will either remain the same or be updated to the value of `count`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is updated to max(maximum_count, count); `start` is less than or equal to `end`; `end` is equal to `n`; `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1 for each index from `start` to `n`; `count` is assigned the sum of the elements in `b`.**
