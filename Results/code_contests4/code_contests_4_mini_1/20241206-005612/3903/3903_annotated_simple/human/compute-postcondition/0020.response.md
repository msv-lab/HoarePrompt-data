The code `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` modifies the list `b` at index `i`. Given that `i` is equal to `start`, which is at least 1, `b[i]` will be updated based on its current value. The value `b[i]` will be changed to `1 - b[i]`, effectively toggling its value between 0 and 1.

Since `b` is derived from `a`, and we do not have specific values for `a` or `b`, we can only conclude that `b[i]` will change its state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `end` is equal to `n`, `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1 at index `i`, `i` is equal to `start`.**
