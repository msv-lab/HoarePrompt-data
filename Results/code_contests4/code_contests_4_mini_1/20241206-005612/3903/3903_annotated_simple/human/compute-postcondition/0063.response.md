The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`, where `i` is `start + 2`. The previous value of `b[i]` is not specified, but it will be toggled between 0 and 1. The values of `n`, `end`, `start`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is `n`; `start` is less than or equal to `n`; `i` is `start + 2`; `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is `n`; `start` is less than or equal to `n`; `i` is `start + 2`; `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]`.**
