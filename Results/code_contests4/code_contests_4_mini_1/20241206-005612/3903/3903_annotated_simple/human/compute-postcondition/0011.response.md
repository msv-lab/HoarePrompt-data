According to the code, the loop is defined to iterate over the range from `start` to `end + 1`. In this case, `start` is 0 and `end` is 1, meaning the loop will iterate over the values 0 and 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken the values 0 and then 1. The loop is about to complete its iterations after `i` reaches 1.

Since `i` will increment after the last iteration, `i` will now be 2. For the loop to execute again, the range needs to accommodate the value of `i` which is now 2. However, the current `end` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `end` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 2, `b[i]` is toggled (1 - `b[i]`), for the loop to execute a second time `end` must be at least 2.**
