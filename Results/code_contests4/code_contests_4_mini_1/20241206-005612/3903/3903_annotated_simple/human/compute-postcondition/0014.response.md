The value of `count` is assigned the sum of the elements in the list `b` from indices `start` to `end`. Since `b` contains the toggled values within the specified range, the exact value of `count` will depend on the contents of `b` in that range. The other variables, `n`, `maximum_count`, `start`, and `end`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `end` is at least `start`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from `start` to `end`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `end` is at least `start`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from `start` to `end.**
