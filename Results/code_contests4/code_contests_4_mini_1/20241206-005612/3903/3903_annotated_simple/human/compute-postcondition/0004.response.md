According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, since the range starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 1`. Given that `n` is already defined within the range of 1 to 100, it means that the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `end` will initialize to 0, which is the first value in the range defined by `n`. Other variables `maximum_count` and `start` do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `end` will be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0**.
