Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is updated with toggled values, `end` is equal to `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `n`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
