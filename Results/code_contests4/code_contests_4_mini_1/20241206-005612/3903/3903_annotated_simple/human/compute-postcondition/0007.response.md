According to the code, the execution of the loop is determined by the variables `start` and `end`. The loop will execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Given that `start` is 0 and `end` is also 0 in the provided state, the loop can execute because the condition `start <= end` holds true.

However, the loop will iterate only once (for `i = 0`) since `end + 1` will be 1. Thus, for the loop to be executed, `i` will start at `start`, which is 0, and will refer to the first index in the range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0.**
