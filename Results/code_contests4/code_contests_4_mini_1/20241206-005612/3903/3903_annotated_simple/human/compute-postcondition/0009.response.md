According to the code, the loop execution is based on the variables `start` and `end`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 0 and `end` is 0. This means that the loop has only executed for `i` equal to `start` (which is 0) and subsequently `end` (which is also 0). 

To execute the loop one more time, the loop needs to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must become 1, and for this to happen, the `end` must be at least 1 (since `i` can only go up to `end`).

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `start` remains 0
- `end` must be at least 1 to allow for another iteration

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 1.**
