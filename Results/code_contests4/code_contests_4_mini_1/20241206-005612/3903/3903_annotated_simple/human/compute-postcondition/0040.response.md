Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the loop will not execute again.***
