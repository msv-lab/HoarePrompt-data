According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop will run from `start` to `end`, inclusive. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `start` must be less than or equal to `end`. Given that `end` is defined as `n - 1`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, this means `end` can take a value from 0 to 99. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `start` is within the range of `start ≤ end`. 

Thus, we need to adjust:
- `start` should be at least 0 and at most `end`, which is `n - 1`.

The loop will execute the first time with:
- `i` starting at `start`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `start` is at least 0 and at most `end`, `i` is `start`**.
