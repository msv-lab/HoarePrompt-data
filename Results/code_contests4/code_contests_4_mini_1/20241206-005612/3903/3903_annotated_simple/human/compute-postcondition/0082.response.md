According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `n` and the initialization of `end`. The loop `for end in range(0, n):` will execute if `end` can take on values from 0 to `n-1`. Given that `start` is `n + 1`, it indicates that the loop cannot execute because `start` is not less than `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `start` is less than `n`, meaning we can decrease `start` to `n` or below. Additionally, before the loop starts, `end` should be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the `range` for the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `maximum_count` remains unchanged, `start` is adjusted to be less than `n`, `end` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
