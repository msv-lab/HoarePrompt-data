Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is the maximum count calculated from the toggled values of `b` for all valid `end` indices, `start` remains equal to `n`, and `count` is the sum of the elements in `b` when `start` is less than or equal to `end` for the last iteration. If `start` is greater than `end`, `maximum_count` remains unchanged.**
