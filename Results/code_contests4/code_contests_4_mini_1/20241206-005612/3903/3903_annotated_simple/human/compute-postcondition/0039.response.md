The value of `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `count`. The previous values of `maximum_count` and `count` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, we know that `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` will either remain the same or be updated to a higher value depending on the comparison. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is `n - 1`; `start` is at least 0 and at most `end`; `count` is the sum of elements in `b`; `maximum_count` is updated to be max of its previous value and `count`.
