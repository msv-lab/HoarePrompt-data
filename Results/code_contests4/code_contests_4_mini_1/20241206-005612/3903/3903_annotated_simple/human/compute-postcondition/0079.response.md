Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]` for all indices `i` from `start` to `end`, `count` is the sum of the values in array `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`. If `start` is greater than `end`, no changes occur.***
