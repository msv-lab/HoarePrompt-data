The code executes a print statement for the variable `maximum_count`. The variable `maximum_count` is previously defined and holds the maximum count of 1s obtained by toggling segments of the list `a`. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `count` do not change with this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is the maximum count of 1s that can be obtained by toggling segments of the list `a`; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is less than `n`; `count` is the sum of the elements in the last toggled list `b` and `maximum_count` has been printed.
