The loop toggles the values of the array `b` from `start` to `end`, where `end` is equal to `n`. Each iteration changes the value of `b[i]` to `1 - b[i]`, effectively flipping the binary value (0 to 1 or 1 to 0). If the loop iterates from `start` to `end`, after all iterations:

- `i` will reach `end`, which is `n`.
- The values of `b[start]` to `b[n]` will have been toggled.

If the loop starts from `start` and goes to `end`, it will execute exactly `(end - start + 1)` times. 

Since the initial state specifies that `b` is a copy of `a`, we can conclude the following:

- If `start` is less than or equal to `n`, all values from `b[start]` to `b[n]` will be toggled.
- If `start` is greater than `n`, the loop won't execute at all, and `b` will remain the same as `a`.

Thus, the output state, after all iterations of the loop have finished, will be as follows:

Output State: **`b` is updated such that `b[start]` to `b[n]` are toggled from their original values in `a`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `n`.**
