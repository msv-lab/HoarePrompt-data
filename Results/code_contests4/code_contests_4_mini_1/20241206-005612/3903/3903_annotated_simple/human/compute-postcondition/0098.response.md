The code assigns the value `1 - b[i]` to `b[i]`. Since `i` is 1 for the first execution of the loop, we need to consider the value of `b[1]`. However, the initial value of `b[1]` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `b[1]` after the operation, but we can express the change.

The output state will reflect that `b[1]` is updated based on its current value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `start` is 1; `end` is 1; `b[1]` is updated to `1 - b[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `start` is 1; `end` is 1; `b[1]` is updated to `1 - b[1]`**
