The code `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` toggles the value at index `i` of the list `b`. The initial state specifies that the loop is set to execute a second time under certain conditions related to `i`, `end`, and `n`. However, the specific values of `b` and `i` are not provided, which limits our ability to define the output state precisely. The other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is at least `start`, and `end` must be less than or equal to 99; the value at index `i` of list `b` is toggled. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is at least `start`, and `end` must be less than or equal to 99; the value at index `i` of list `b` is toggled.**
