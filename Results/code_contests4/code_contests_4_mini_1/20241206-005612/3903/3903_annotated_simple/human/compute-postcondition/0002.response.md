The variable `maximum_count` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this line of code, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is an iterable of integers; `maximum_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is an iterable of integers; `maximum_count` is 0**
