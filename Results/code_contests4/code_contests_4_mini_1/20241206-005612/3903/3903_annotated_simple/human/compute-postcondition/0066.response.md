The value of `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `count`. The values of `count`, `start`, `end`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged, but `maximum_count` may change depending on its previous value compared to `count`. Therefore, the output state is: `b` is updated with toggled values, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `n`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.

Output State: **`b` is updated with toggled values, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `n`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.**
