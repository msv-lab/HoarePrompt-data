According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. The loop is defined to iterate from `start` to `end`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `start`, and `end` is equal to `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. 

Since `i` is equal to `start`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment by 1. Thus, if the loop is to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `end`. After the last iteration, we will increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes `start + 1`. 

Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are that `i` must now be equal to `start + 1`, and `end` must still be equal to `n` (which is greater than or equal to `start + 1`).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is `n`; `start` is less than or equal to `n`; `i` is `start + 1`; `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time.**
