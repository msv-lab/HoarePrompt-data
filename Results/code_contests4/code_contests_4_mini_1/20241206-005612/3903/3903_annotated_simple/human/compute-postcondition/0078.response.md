The value of `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `count`. The previous value of `count` is the sum of the values in array `b`, and since `maximum_count` is compared to it, the new value will be either the existing `maximum_count` or `count`, whichever is greater. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is at least equal to `start`; `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]` for all indices `i` from `start` to `end`; `count` is the sum of the values in array `b`; `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.
