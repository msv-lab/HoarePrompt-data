According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variables `start` and `end`. The variable `end` is set to `n`, and given that `n` is between 1 and 100, `end` will also be at least 1. For the loop to execute, `start` must be less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute. At the beginning of the loop, `i` is initialized to `start`. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `start` is less than or equal to `n`, and `i` should be equal to `start`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `start` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is `start`**
