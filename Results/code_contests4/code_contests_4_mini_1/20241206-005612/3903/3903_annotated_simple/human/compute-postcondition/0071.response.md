The code `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` updates the value of `b` at index `i`. Since `i` is initialized to `start`, which is within the bounds of `n`, the value of `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1 (assuming `b[i]` was initialized to either 0 or 1). The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is at least equal to `start`, `i` is `start`, and `b[i]` is toggled to 1 - `b[i]`.**
