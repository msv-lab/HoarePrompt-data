The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`, which flips the value at index `i` in the list `b`. The previous value of `b[i]` is unknown as `b` is not defined in the initial state, but we know that `i` has been incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to express the output state based on the information given.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is at least `start`, and `end` must be less than or equal to 99; `i` is now `i + 1`, and `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`**
