The value of `b[i]` is flipped between 0 and 1. This means if `b[i]` was previously 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The previous states of `n`, `end`, `start`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State will include the details of the flipping operation on `b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is `n - 1`; `start` is at least 0 and at most `end - 1`; `i` is `start + 2`; `b[i]` is flipped between 0 and 1.**
