Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is set to `n`, `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1 for each index from `start` to `n`, and `count` is assigned the sum of the elements in `b`.***
