According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop will execute as long as `start` is less than or equal to `end`. 

Given that `end` is equal to `n`, the loop will start executing when `start` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, `i` will take on the value of `start`. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `start` is within the range defined by `end`. 

Thus, the conditions are:
- `start` should be at least 1 (and less than or equal to `end`, which is equal to `n`).
- `i` should be equal to `start`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `end` is equal to `n`, `b` is a list created from `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `start` is at least 1 and `i` is equal to `start`.**
