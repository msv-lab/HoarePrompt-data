According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 0 to `n` (exclusive). Since `end` is currently 0 at the end of the last iteration, it indicates that this is the first iteration of the loop. After this iteration, `end` will be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, and `end` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `end` must be 1 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `end` has been incremented and the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
