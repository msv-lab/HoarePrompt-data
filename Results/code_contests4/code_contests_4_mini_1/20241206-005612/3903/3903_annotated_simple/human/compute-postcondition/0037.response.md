To analyze the loop and determine the final output state, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, where `end` is `n - 1`.
2. Within each iteration, the value of `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.

Given the conditions:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, which means `end` will be at least 0 (when n = 1) and at most 99 (when n = 100).
- `start` is at least 0 and at most `end`.

### Analyzing the Loop:
- If the loop executes, it will toggle the values of `b` at indices from `start` to `end`.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `start` > `end`), the values in `b` will remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
If the loop executes, all elements in `b` from index `start` to `end` will have been toggled. Specifically:
- If `start` is 0 and `end` is `n - 1`, then all elements in `b` from index 0 to `n - 1` will have been toggled.
- If the loop does not execute, `b` remains unchanged.

Therefore, regardless of whether the loop executed or not, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is `n - 1`; `start` is at least 0 and at most `end`; `b` is toggled between 0 and 1 from indices `start` to `end` if the loop executed.**
