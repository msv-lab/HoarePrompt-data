According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate `n` times, starting from `start = 0` and ending at `start = n - 1`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, it guarantees that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute for the first time. 

At the start of the loop, `maximum_count` is 0, and `start` will be initialized to 0. The iterable `a` does not affect the execution of the loop itself since it's not directly tied to the loop's control variable. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
