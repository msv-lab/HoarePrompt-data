Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, and `end` is at least `start`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b[i]` is toggled for each `i` from `start` to `end`, `count` is the sum of the elements in `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the current `count`.***
