The code `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` flips the value at the index `i` of the list `b`. Given the initial state where `i` is `start + 1`, and since `start` is at least 0 and at most `end` (which is `n - 1`), `i` will therefore be at least 1 and at most `n`. 

The value at `b[i]` can be either 0 or 1. The operation changes `b[i]` to 1 if it was 0 and to 0 if it was 1. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is `n - 1`; `start` is at least 0 and at most `end`; `i` is `start + 1`; `b[i]` is flipped between 0 and 1.**
