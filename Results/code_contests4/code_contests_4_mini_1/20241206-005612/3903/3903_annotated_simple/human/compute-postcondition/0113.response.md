According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is at least `start`, and `end` must be less than or equal to 99. Since `i` is the current index in the loop, it will take values from `start` to `end`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `end`. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, if `end` is greater than `i`, then `i` can be incremented for another iteration.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration. If `i` equals `end`, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more indices to iterate over. If `i` is less than `end`, we can increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

So, if `i` is currently less than `end`, then we adjust `i` to `i + 1`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is at least `start`, and `end` must be less than or equal to 99; `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again, so `i` is now one more than it was at the end of the last iteration (i.e., `i` is now `i + 1`)**.
