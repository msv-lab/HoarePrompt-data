The expression updates `maximum_count` to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `count`. The value of `maximum_count` is initially 0, and `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from `start` to `end`, which is within the defined constraints for `n`. Thus, after execution, `maximum_count` will either remain 0 or be updated to the value of `count`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `end` is at least `start`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from `start` to `end.**
