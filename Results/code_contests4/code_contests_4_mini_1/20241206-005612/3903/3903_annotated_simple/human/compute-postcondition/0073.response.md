The statement `b[i] = 1 - b[i]` changes the value of `b[i]`. The variable `i` is defined as `start + 1`, and since the loop is set to execute a second time, it follows that `i` is within the bounds of the list `b`. The previous value of `b[i]` is not specified, but the expression `1 - b[i]` toggles its value between 0 and 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `b[i]` based on its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `end` is at least equal to `start`, `i` is `start + 1`, and `b[i]` changes to `1 - b[i]`.**
