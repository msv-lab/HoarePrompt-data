The variable `b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`, which toggles the value of `b[i]`. The previous state of `b[i]` is not specified, but the toggling means if `b[i]` was `0`, it will become `1`, and if it was `1`, it will become `0`. The other variables (`n`, `maximum_count`, `count`, `start`, `end`) remain unaffected in their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` remains as it is from the last iteration; `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from `start` to `end`; `start` is 0; `end` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time; `b[0]` is toggled to `1 - b[0]`.
