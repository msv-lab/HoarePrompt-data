The loop toggles the values of the list `b` between 0 and 1 for each index `i` from `start` to `end` (inclusive). The final state of the list `b` will reflect the toggling operations performed by the loop.

Given that the loop executes for each value from `start` to `end`, after all iterations:

- If the range from `start` to `end` contains `n - start + 1` elements, the values in `b` will be toggled `n - start + 1` times for the respective indices.
- Each index `i` in the range will be toggled, which means that if it starts as 0, it will become 1 after an odd number of toggles and remain 0 after an even number of toggles.

Since `end` is equal to `n`, the loop will toggle each index from `start` to `n`. The exact final values for `b[i]` depend on the initial values. However, we can conclude the following:

If the number of toggles (which is `n - start + 1`) is odd, the values at indices from `start` to `n` in `b` will be the opposite of their original values. If it is even, they will remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `end` is equal to `n`, `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1 for each index from `start` to `n`.**
