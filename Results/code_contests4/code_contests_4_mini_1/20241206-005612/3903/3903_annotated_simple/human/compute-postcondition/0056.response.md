According to the code, the loop control variable `end` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `end` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is currently at its maximum value of `n - 1`, which means the next value of `end` would be `n`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` should be `n`, and `n` must remain an integer within the range of 1 to 100. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; for the loop to execute one more time `end` must be `n`**
