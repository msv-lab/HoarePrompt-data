Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` remains as it is from the last iteration; `count` is the sum of elements in `b` from `0` to `end`; `start` is 0; `end` is at least 0; `b[0]` is toggled, and if `n` > 1, `b[1]` is also toggled if it exists; `count` is now updated to the sum of elements in `b`.**
