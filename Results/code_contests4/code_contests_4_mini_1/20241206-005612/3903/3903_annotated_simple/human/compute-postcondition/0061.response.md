The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The variable `i` is equal to `start + 1`, and `b[i]` is affected by this operation. The previous value of `b[i]` is unknown, but after the operation, `b[i]` will be either 0 or 1, depending on its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is `n`; `start` is less than or equal to `n`; `i` is `start + 1`; `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.**
