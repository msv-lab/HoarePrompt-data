Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, and `end` is less than `n` and greater than or equal to `start`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b` is a list created from `a` where its elements from index `start` to `end` are toggled, `count` is the sum of the elements in list `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
