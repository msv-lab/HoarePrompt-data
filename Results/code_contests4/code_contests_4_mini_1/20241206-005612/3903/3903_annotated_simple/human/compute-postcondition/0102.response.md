The value of `b[i]` is updated to its opposite, but since `i` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again and it cannot be because `end` is 2, the loop will not execute, and the state of other variables remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `b[i]` is attempted to be updated, but the loop does not continue.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `start` is 1; `end` is 2; `b[1]` is updated to its opposite; and the loop does not execute because `i` cannot be greater than 2.**
