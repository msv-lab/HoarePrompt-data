In this case, `b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`. The current value of `b[i]` will be toggled between 0 and 1. Since `i` is set to `start` and `start` is less than `n`, `i` is a valid index for `b`. The values of `n`, `start`, and `end` are not directly affected by this operation. The list `b` will have its `start` index (i.e., `b[start]`) changed from its previous value to `1 - b[start]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is at least `start`, `b` is a list created from `a`, and `b[start]` is toggled to `1 - b[start]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is at least `start`, `b` is a list created from `a`, and `b[start]` is toggled to `1 - b[start]`.**
