The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. Since `b[1]` is initially updated to `1 - b[1]` for the loop to execute a second time, the previous value of `b[1]` is not explicitly mentioned, but the operation suggests that it is being toggled between 0 and 1. Therefore, the new value of `b[1]` will be the opposite of its previous state. 

The output states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `start` is 1; `end` is 2; `b[1]` is updated to its opposite.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `start` is 1; `end` is 2; `b[1]` is updated to its opposite.**
