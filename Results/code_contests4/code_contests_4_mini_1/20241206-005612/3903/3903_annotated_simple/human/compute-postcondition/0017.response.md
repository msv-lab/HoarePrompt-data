According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` in relation to `n`. Since `end` is currently ranging from `0` to `n-1`, the loop can execute again if `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is equal to `n-1` (the maximum value for `end`), so for the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `end` will be `n`, and `n` must be such that it is still within the bounds defined in the problem (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, and for the loop to execute one more time `end` must be equal to `n`**.
