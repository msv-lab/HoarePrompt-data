The value of `b[i]` is toggled, meaning it is changed from its current value to `1 - b[i]`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `b[i]`, but it indicates that `b[i]` can take either 0 or 1. Therefore, after executing the line of code, if `b[i]` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. Other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the change in `b[i]` based on its previous state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is 0; `start` is 0; `end` is 2; `b[i]` is toggled (0 becomes 1 or 1 becomes 0)**
