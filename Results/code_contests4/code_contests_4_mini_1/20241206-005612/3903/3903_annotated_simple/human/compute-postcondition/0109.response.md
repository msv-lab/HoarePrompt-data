According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start`, `end`, and `n`. For the loop to execute, `start` must be less than or equal to `end`, and `end` must not exceed `n`. Given that `start` is less than `n`, this state is already ensured. 

However, to execute the loop for the first time, we also need to set `i` to the value of `start`, which is the starting point of the iteration. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is at least `start`, `b` is a list created from `a`, `i` is `start`**
