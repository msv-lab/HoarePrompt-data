According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `end` and the upper limit `n`. If `end` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is the value it reached in the previous iteration, which is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `start` is less than `n`, `end` is the value reached in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute a second time `end` must be less than `n`, and `end` will be incremented by 1.**
