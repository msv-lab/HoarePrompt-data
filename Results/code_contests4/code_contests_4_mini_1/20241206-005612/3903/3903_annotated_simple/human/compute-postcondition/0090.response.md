The value at index `i` of list `b` is toggled from its current value to `1 - b[i]`. Since `i` is 2, the value at index 2 of list `b` is affected. The previous value of `b[2]` can either be 0 or 1 (since it is a binary toggle). Therefore, the new value of `b[2]` will be the opposite of its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `maximum_count` remains unchanged, `start` is 0, `end` is greater than or equal to 2, `b` is a list created from `a`, `i` is 2; the value at index 2 of list `b` is toggled to `1 - b[2]`.**
