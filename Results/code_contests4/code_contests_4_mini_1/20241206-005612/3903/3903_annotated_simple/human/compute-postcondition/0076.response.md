The loop toggles the values of the list `b` between 0 and 1 for indices ranging from `start` to `end`. After the loop has executed for all iterations from `start` to `end`, we will have toggled each corresponding value in `b` within that range.

If `end` is equal to `start`, the loop will execute once, toggling `b[start]`. If `end` is greater than `start`, the loop will toggle the values of `b` for all indices from `start` to `end`, inclusive.

Considering the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and that `end` is currently less than or equal to `n`, the output state after all iterations of the loop will reflect the toggling results for all indices from `start` to `end`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `end` is at least equal to `start`; `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]` for all indices `i` from `start` to `end`.**
