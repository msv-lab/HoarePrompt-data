`a` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input from `raw_input()`, splitting it into separate strings, converting each string to an integer, and creating an iterable of integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is an iterable of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is an iterable of integers from the input.**
