According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `end`, which takes values from 0 to `n-1`. The loop will execute as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be incremented by 1. This means `end` will become `n`, which is not less than `n`. Hence, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; at the end of the last iteration, `end` is n - 1, so for the loop to execute again `end` must be less than n, which it is not. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.**
