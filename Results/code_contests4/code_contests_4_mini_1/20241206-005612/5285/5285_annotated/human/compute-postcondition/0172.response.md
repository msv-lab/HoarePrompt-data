The value of `newizv` is assigned to 0 directly, overwriting its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is either -1 or updated based on the comparison with `mlt`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `st` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is either -1 or updated based on the comparison with `mlt`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `st` is 0.**
