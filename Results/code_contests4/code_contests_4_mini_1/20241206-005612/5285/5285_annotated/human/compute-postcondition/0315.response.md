The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Since `newn` is greater than `newk`, the result will remain positive, but the exact new value of `newn` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `newk` and `st`. The other variables (`newk`, `st`, `izv`, and `newizv`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is still greater than `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is still greater than `newk`**
