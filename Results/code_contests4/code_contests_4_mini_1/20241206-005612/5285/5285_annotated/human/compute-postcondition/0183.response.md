Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn` as a result of multiplying `newk` repeatedly, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk` until it exceeded `newn`, `newnewk` will be the final value after all multiplications and `st` will reflect the total count of multiplications.**
