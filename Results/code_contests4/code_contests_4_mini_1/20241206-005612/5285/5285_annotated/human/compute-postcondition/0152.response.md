The value of `izv` is updated by adding `newizv` to it. The value of `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and since `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` will be a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`.**
