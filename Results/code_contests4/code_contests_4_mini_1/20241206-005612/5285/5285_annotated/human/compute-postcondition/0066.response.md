The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, which is 0; `st` is 0; `b` is reduced to 1 or a prime number greater than 1; `d_osn` contains at least one key representing the count of prime factors; `s` is 0; `cur` is an odd integer greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`; `izv` is 0; `res` is -1; `newk` is equal to `k`; `newn` is equal to `n`; `i` is 1; `newizv` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
