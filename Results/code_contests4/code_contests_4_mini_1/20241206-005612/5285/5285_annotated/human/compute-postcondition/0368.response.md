The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newn` multiplied by `newk^2`, `st` is 2, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`.

Output State: **`newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newn` multiplied by `newk^2`, `st` is 2, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`.**
