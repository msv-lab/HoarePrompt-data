The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified for `newk`, but `newnewk` will now hold whatever value `newk` has. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is either -1 or updated based on the comparison with `mlt`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `st` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is either -1 or updated based on the comparison with `mlt`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`, `st` is 0.**
