`st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 2, so after execution, `st` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of 2, `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` raised to the power of 4, `st` is 3, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0.
