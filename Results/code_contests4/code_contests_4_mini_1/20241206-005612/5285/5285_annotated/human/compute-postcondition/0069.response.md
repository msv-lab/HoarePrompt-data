The value of `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 0, so the calculation is as follows:

1. `newizv * 2` results in `0 * 2 = 0`.
2. Adding 1 gives `0 + 1 = 1`.

After executing the code, `newizv` is now 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `b` is reduced to 1 or a prime number greater than 1, `d_osn` contains at least one key representing the count of prime factors, `s` is 0, `cur` is an odd integer greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`, `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1**
