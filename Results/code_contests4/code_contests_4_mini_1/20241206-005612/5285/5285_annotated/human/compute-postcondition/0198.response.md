The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, but the previous value of `izv` is unknown, and we don't have information about `newizv`. The state of `newn` being greater than `newk + newk` does not affect this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated to be greater than `newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` (unknown value).

Output State: **`newn` is updated to be greater than `newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` (unknown value)**
