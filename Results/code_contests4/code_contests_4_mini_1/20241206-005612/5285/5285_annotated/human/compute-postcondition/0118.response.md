The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, the exact values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not specified, but we know that `newn` will decrease. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1), `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1), `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.**
