The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is either 2 or an odd integer greater than 2; `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1; `b` is divided by `cur` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
