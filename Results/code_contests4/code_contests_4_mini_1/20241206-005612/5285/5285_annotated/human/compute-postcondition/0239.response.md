According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the condition `i < 10` holds true. In the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `st - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 10. 

Since `st` is greater than 0, `i` (which is `st - 1`) can be adjusted by ensuring that `st` is at least 10. This means that `st` must be at least 11 for `i` to be 10 or more, which would allow the loop condition to evaluate to true.

Currently, the state indicates `i` is `st - 1`, which means if `st` were equal to 10, `i` would be 9, allowing the loop to execute again. Therefore, we don't need to adjust anything else as the other states do not affect the loop's ability to execute one more time.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 10, hence `st` must be at least 10**
