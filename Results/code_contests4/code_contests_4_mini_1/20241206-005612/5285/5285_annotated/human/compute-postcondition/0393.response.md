Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of the final value of `st`, `izv` is the accumulated value of `newizv` added for each iteration until `newn` became less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` remains unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the final value of `st`, and `st` is the total number of iterations executed in the nested loops.**
