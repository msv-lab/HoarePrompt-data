The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is not specified, but it is increased by `newizv`. Other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the final value indicating the number of iterations, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the final value indicating the number of iterations, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`.**
