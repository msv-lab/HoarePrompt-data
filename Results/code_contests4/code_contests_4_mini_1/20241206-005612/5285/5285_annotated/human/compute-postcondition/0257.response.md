According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. For the loop to execute, `st` must be greater than 0. If `st` is equal to 0, then `i` would be 0 and `newizv` would be 0, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or statement. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `st` is greater than 0. Additionally, since the loop starts with `i` being initialized to 0, it will be 0 at the beginning of the first iteration.

State: **`newnewk` is unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
