The variable `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not provided, but we know that `newnewk` remains unchanged and `izv` is updated before this operation. Therefore, we can only state the change to `newn`. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is unchanged; `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value.**
