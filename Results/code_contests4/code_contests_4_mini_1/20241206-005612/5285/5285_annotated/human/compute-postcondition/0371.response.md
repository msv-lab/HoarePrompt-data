The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and since `st` is initially 2, after execution, `st` becomes 3. The values of the other variables `newizv`, `newnewk`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is updated by multiplying with `newk`, `st` is 3, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is updated by multiplying with `newk`, `st` is 3, `i` is 0**
