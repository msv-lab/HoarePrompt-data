To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated by subtracting `newk`. For the loop to execute again, the value of `newn` must still be greater than `newk`. 

1. We do not have the exact current values of `newn` and `newk`, but we know the relationship:
   - `newn` must be greater than `newk`.

Since the only requirement for the loop to execute again is that `newn` remains greater than `newk`, we need to ensure that after the last update of `newn`, it still satisfies this condition.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `newn` must be greater than `newk`.

State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`**
