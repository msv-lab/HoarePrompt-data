The variable `newizv` is updated according to the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, but it will be multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1. Other variables (`newn`, `newnewk`, `st`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `newizv` has been modified but does not provide an exact value since the initial value of `newizv` is not known.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**
