The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
