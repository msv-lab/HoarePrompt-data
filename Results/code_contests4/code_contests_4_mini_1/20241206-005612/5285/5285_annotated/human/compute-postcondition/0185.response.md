The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn` as a result of multiplying `newk` repeatedly, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk` until it exceeded `newn`, `newnewk` will be the final value after all multiplications, and `st` is equal to 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
