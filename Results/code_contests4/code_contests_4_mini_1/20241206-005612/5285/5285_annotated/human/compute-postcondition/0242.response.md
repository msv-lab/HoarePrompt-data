The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i` remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, and `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, and `newizv` is 0**.
