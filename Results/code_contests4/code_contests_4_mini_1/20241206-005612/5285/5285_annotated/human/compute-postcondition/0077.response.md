The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its previous value. The initial state indicates that `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, but the specific values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact value of `newn` after the operation, but we know that it is decreased by `newk ** st`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.**
