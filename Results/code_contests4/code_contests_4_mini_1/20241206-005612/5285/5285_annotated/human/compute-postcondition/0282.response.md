Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is 10, `izv` is the accumulated value based on the sum of `newizv`, `newizv` is the last value calculated from the inner loop, `st` is the last value computed before the final exit of the loop, `newnewk` is greater than or equal to `newn`, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`. If `res` is equal to -1, then `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`. Otherwise, if `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is now assigned the value of `mlt`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
