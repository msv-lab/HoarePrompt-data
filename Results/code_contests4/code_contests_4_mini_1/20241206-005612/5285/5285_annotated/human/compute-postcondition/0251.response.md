The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, but the current value of `newk` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `newnewk` remains unchanged as we don't know the value of `newk`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0, and `newnewk` is unchanged as it is multiplied by an unknown value of `newk`.

Output State: **`st` is 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0, and `newnewk` is unchanged as it is multiplied by an unknown value of `newk`.**
