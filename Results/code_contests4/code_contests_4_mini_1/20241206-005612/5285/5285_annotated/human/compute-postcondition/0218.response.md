The loop continues executing as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Each iteration multiplies `newnewk` by `newk` and increments `st` by 1. Initially, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and since `newnewk` starts less than or equal to `newn`, the loop will run until `newnewk` exceeds `newn`.

After the loop finishes executing, `st` will hold the count of how many times the loop ran, which corresponds to the number of times `newnewk` could be multiplied by `newk` before it surpassed `newn`. The value of `newnewk` will be greater than `newn` and `newizv` will remain 0 throughout the execution.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations until `newnewk` exceeded `newn`, `i` is increased by the same number of iterations, and `newizv` is 0.**
