The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. Since `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` will also be equal to `k`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `st` is 0, `newnewk` is greater than or equal to `newn`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `st` is 0, `newnewk` is greater than or equal to `newn`**.
