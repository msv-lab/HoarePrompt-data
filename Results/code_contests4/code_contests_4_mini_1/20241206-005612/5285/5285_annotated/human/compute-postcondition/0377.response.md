The value of `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 0, the calculation becomes `0 * 2 + 1`, which evaluates to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
