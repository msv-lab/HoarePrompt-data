The value of `newizv` is updated with the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3. Therefore, we calculate:

`newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 3, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 7, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 3.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 3, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 7, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 3.**
