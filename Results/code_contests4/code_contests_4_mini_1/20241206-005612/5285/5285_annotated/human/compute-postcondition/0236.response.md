The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, but it is affected by the addition of `newizv`. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`, `newk`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` currently must be greater than `newk * st + newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` currently must be greater than `newk * st + newk`.**
