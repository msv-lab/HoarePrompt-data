Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. If `cur` is greater than or equal to `b ** 0.5`, then `b` remains unchanged, `d_osn[2]` is either incremented to 1 or 2 depending on the divisibility condition of `b`, and `cur` is unchanged, while breaking out of the most internal loop.***
