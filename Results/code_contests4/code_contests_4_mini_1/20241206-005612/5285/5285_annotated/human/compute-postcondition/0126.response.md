The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`. Since `newnewk` is initially equal to `newk`, the operation results in `newnewk` becoming equal to `newk` squared. The value of `newk` is constrained to be less than or equal to `1`, so `newnewk` will also remain less than or equal to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newk` is less than or equal to `1`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newk` is less than or equal to `1`.**
