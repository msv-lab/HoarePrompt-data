Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is the total accumulated value from all iterations, `i` is 10, `newizv` is the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, and if `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is set to `mlt`.***
