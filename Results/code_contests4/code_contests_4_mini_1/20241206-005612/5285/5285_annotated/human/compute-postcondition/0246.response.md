`st` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `st` is 0, after execution, `st` will be 1. The values of `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is unchanged as the multiplication operation cannot be performed without an initial value for `newnewk`.

Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is unchanged as the multiplication operation cannot be performed without an initial value for `newnewk`.**
