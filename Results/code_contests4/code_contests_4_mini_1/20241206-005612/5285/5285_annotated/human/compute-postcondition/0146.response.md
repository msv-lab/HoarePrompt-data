The variable `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The value of `newizv` is given as `2^st - 1`. Since `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` will be a positive integer. The previous value of `izv` is not specified, but it will be updated to `izv + newizv`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, and `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`.**
