According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 2, and `st` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
