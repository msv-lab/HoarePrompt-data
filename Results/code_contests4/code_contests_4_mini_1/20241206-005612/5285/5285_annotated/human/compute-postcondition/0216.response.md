The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, but since the previous value of `newnewk` is not specified, we cannot determine the new value of `newnewk`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` (previous value of `newnewk` is unknown).

Output State: **`st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` (previous value of `newnewk` is unknown)**.
