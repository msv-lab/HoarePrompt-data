The value of `st` is assigned to 0, which changes its previous value (which was greater than 0) to 0. This will affect the condition for the loop to execute again since `i` is `st - 1`, which would now be `-1`. The previous state indicated that for the loop to execute again, `st` must be at least 10. Now, since `st` is 0, this condition is no longer satisfied. Therefore, the output state is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is -1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 10, hence `st` must be at least 10.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is -1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 10, hence `st` must be at least 10.**
