The loop runs for `st` iterations, and during each iteration, the value of `newizv` is updated using the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1`. The pattern from the iterations shows that `newizv` will take on values of 1, 3, and 7 for the first three iterations, suggesting that after `st` iterations, `newizv` will be equal to `2^st - 1`.

If `st` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the value of `newizv` will remain 0. 

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

Output State: **`newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `st`.**
