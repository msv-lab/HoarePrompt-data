`st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`.

Output State: **`st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`.**
