According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, and `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk`.

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, it indicates that `newk` has a value such that it currently prevents `newn` from being greater than `newk * st`. For the loop to execute once more, we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state such that `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. Given that `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk`, for it to be greater than `newk * st`, we can express this as `newn` must be greater than `newk * st + newk`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` currently must be greater than `newk * st + newk`**
