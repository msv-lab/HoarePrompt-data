Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 10, `newizv` is the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is either -1 or updated based on the comparison with `mlt`, and `k` is the next element in `d_osn`; `newk` is now equal to `k`.**
