According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will become 1. Additionally, `newizv` will remain changed as `newizv * 2 + 1` from the previous iteration.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is `newizv * 2 + 1` for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
