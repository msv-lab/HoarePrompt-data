The value of `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is required for the calculation, but it is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `newizv` is modified based on its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 1; `newizv` is modified to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
