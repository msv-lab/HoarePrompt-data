Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; if `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, then `b` is updated to `b / cur` if `b` is divisible by `cur`; `s` remains 0; `d_osn[2]` is incremented either to 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cur` if `b` is divisible by `cur`, or incremented by 1 otherwise; `cur` is either 2 or an odd integer greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop.***
