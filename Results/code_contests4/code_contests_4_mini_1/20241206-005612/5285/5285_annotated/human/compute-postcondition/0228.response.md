The loop modifies the variable `newizv` by repeatedly applying the operation `newizv * 2 + 1` for each iteration up to `st` times. Since `st` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `st` times, leading to an exponential growth in the value of `newizv`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `newnewk` remains greater than `newn`.
- `st` will still be greater than 0.
- `i` will be equal to `st - 1` (the index of the last executed iteration).
- `newizv` will be equal to `(2^st) - 1`, since each iteration effectively doubles the previous value and adds 1, which results in the final formula.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`.**
