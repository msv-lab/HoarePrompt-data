According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `newn` must be greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, `newk` is unchanged, and `newn` has been updated by subtracting `newk`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk`, which implies that `newn` must be adjusted to ensure it remains greater than `newk`.

If `newk` is unchanged and `newn` has been updated (which I assume means `newn` is now equal to or less than `newk`), then for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk`.

State: **`newnewk` is unchanged; `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` currently must be greater than `newk`**
