The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / 2` if it is divisible by 2; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1; and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
