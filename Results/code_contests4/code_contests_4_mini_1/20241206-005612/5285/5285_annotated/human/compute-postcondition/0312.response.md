The loop executes `st` times, and during each iteration, `newizv` is updated by multiplying it by 2 and adding 1. The pattern of `newizv` can be observed as follows:

- After the 1st iteration, `newizv` becomes `1`.
- After the 2nd iteration, `newizv` becomes `3` (which is `2 * 1 + 1`).
- After the 3rd iteration, `newizv` becomes `7` (which is `2 * 3 + 1`).

This creates a pattern where after each iteration, `newizv` can be expressed as `2^i - 1`, where `i` is the number of iterations completed.

If the loop executes `st` times, `newizv` will be `2^st - 1` after the final iteration. The other variables `newn`, `newk`, `newnewk`, and `izv` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution. 

If `st` is equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `newizv` remains `0`.

Therefore, the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and `i` is equal to `st`.**
