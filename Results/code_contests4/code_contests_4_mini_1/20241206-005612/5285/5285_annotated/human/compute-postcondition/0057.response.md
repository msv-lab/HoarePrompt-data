`st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is reduced to 1 or a prime number greater than 1; `d_osn` contains at least one key representing the count of prime factors; `s` is 0; `cur` is an odd integer greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`; `izv` is 0; `res` is -1; `newk` is equal to `k`; `newn` is equal to `n`; `i` is 1; `st` is 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is updated by multiplying with `newk`.
