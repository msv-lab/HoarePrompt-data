The code `newn = newn - newk ** st` updates the value of `newn` by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and `st` is greater than 0, we can conclude that `newk ** st` will be a positive value. Therefore, `newn` will decrease. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.**
