The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value. Since `newk` is less than `newnewk` and `st` is greater than 0, `newk ** st` will be a positive number, thus reducing the value of `newn`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`**.
