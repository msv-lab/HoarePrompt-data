The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The other variables `newn`, `newk`, `newnewk`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of 2; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed; `st` is 2; `i` is 1; `newizv` is 0; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of 2; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed; `st` is 2; `i` is 1; `newizv` is 0; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to 1.**
