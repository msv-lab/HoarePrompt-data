According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
