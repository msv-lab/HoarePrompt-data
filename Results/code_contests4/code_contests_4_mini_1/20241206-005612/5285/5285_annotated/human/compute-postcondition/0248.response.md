The code attempts to multiply `newnewk` by `newk`. However, `newnewk` is currently 0, so the result of the multiplication will still be 0, regardless of the value of `newk`. The variable `newnewk` will remain 0 after the operation. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0**
