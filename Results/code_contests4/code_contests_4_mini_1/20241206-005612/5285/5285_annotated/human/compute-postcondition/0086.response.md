`st` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since there are no further calculations or assignments impacting `newn`, `newk`, or `i`, the output state reflects the new value of `st` while the others are unaffected. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0**
