The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, this operation results in `newnewk` becoming `newk` cubed (i.e., `newnewk = newk * newnewk`). The variables `newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv` are not affected by this operation, and the conditions for the loop to execute again remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed; `st` is 1; `i` is 1; `newizv` is 0; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to 1.**
