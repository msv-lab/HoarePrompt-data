According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute if `st` is greater than 0. Since the state before the loop indicates that `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk`, it implies that `st` must be at least 1 for the loop to run. Additionally, `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. 

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, it indicates that there has been some multiplication, and thus `st` should be greater than 0 unless it was previously set to 0 due to some condition. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to establish that `st` is greater than 0. Thus, we need to ensure that `st` is at least 1 for the loop to run. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
