The code initializes a `defaultdict` of type `int`, which allows for the creation of a dictionary where each key will have a default value of 0 if it is not already present. The values of the variables `n`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged because the code only introduces a new variable `d_osn`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0.**
