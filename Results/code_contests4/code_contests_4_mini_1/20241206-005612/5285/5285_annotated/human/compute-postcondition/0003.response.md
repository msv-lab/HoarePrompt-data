`cur` is assigned the value 2. The values of `n`, `b`, `s`, and `d_osn` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `cur` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `cur` is 2**
