Postcondition: ***`b` is reduced to 1 or a prime number greater than 1. If `b` is greater than 2, `d_osn[b]` is incremented by 1 while `s` remains 0, and `d_osn` still contains the count of the prime factors of the initial value of `b`, with `cur` being an odd integer greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`.***
