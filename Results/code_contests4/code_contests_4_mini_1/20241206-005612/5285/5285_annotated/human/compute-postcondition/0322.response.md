Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is equal to the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until `newn` became less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` remains unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `st`.**
