According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is equal to `newk`, which means `newnewk` is equal to `newn`. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed.

State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`**
