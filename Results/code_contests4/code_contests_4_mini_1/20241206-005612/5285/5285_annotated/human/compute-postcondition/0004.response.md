According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12. Since `b` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will execute at least one time without any adjustments. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `cur` is 2**
