According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
