The value of `izv` is increased by `newizv`, where `newizv` is defined as `2^st - 1`. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, but it will now be updated to `izv + newizv`. The states of the other variables (`newn` and `newk`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decremented by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk`.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decremented by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk`.**
