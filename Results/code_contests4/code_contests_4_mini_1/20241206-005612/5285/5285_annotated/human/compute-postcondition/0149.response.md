`izv` is updated by adding `newizv` to its current value. The value of `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and since `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` will be a positive integer. The values of `newnewk`, `newn`, `newk`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `izv` has been updated.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`**
