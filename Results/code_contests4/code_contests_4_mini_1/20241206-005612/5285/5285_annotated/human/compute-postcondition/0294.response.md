The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is less than `newn`, it has an initial value, but we don't know its specific value. The variable `newk` is equal to `k`, but its value is also unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `newnewk`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `st` is 0**
