The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since `i` is initially -1, it will become 0 after execution. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the loop condition remains valid for further iterations. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, and the loop can execute again since `i` is still less than 10.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, and the loop can execute again since `i` is still less than 10.**
