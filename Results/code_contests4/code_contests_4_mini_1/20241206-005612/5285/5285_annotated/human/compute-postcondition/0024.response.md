The variable `cur` is incremented by 2, but its previous value is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its resulting value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1; and `cur` is incremented by 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1; `cur` is incremented by 2.**
