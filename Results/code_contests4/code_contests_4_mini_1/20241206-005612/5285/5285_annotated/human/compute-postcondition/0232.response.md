According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` multiplied by `st`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, which implies that `newn` must be adjusted to ensure that it remains greater than `newk * st` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since `newn` is currently less than its previous value, to allow the loop to proceed again, we need to adjust it so that `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`**
