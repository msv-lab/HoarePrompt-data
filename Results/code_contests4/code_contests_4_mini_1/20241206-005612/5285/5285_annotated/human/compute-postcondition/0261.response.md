According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1` during the loop. 

So, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is unchanged, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2; `newizv` has been updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
