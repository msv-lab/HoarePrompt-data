The variable `s` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `b` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0**
