Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is the accumulated value of `newizv` added for each iteration until `newn` became less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `newk` remains unchanged; `newizv` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to the final value of `st`; `st` is the total number of iterations executed in the nested loops; `mlt` is the result of `izv // d_osn[k]`; `res` is not equal to -1.***
