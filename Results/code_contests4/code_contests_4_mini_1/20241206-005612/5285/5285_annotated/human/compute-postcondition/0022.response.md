The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / cur`; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `d_osn[2]` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cur` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
