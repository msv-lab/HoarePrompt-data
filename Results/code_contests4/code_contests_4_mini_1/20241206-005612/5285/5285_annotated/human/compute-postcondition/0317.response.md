The value of `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are not given, but `izv` is updated based on this addition. The other variables, `newn` and `newk`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk`; `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk`; `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`.**
