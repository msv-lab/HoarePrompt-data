According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop condition is `newn > newk ** st`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, `izv` has been updated, and `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `newn` remains greater than `newk ** st`. Since `newn` has already been decreased by `newk`, we can deduce that for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust `newn` such that it is still greater than `newk ** st`. 

To ensure that the condition holds true, we can state that `newn` needs to be greater than `newk ** st` after the decrement. Therefore, we need to specifically ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk ** st` after the last update.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`.**
