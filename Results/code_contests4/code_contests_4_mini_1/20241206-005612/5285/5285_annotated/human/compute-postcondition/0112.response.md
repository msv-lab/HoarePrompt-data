The value of `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this operation will result in a new value for `newn`. The specific values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact final value of `newn`, but we know it will be reduced. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `st`; `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1); `izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.**
