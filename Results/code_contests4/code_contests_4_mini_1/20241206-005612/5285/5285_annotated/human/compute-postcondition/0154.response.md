Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk ** st` (and could be 0 if it was reduced to that point).**
