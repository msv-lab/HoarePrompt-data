Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. If `b` is divisible by `cur`, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1, and `b` is divided by `cur`, continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If `b` is not divisible by `cur`, and if `cur` is equal to 2, then `cur` is set to 3, and `d_osn[2]` is either incremented to 1 or 2 depending on whether `b` is divisible by `cur`, while `b` and `s` remain unchanged. If `cur` is greater than 2, it is incremented by 2, `d_osn[2]` is either incremented to 1 or 2 depending on the divisibility condition of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop, leaving `b` and `s` unchanged.***
