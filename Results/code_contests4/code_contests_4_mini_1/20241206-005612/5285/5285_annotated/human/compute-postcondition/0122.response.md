The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is equal to `st`, which is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1), and `izv` is the total accumulated value from `izv` after adding `newizv` for each iteration of the loop.**
