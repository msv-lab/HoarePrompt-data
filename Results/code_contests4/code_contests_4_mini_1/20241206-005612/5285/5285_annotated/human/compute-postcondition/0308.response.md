According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1. After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 2, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2.**
