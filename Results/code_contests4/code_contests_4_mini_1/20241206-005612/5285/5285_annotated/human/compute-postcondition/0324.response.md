The value of `st` is assigned to 0. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `izv`, `newizv`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is equal to the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until `newn` became less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` remains unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `st`, which is now 0.
