The variable `newizv` is modified by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not mentioned, but it will be multiplied by 2 and then increased by 1. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is 2; `newizv` is modified to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is 2; `newizv` is modified to `newizv * 2 + 1**
