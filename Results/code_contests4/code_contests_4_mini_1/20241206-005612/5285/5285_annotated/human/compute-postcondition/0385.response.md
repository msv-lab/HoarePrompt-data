The variable `newn` is decremented by the value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn` and `newk` are not specified, but it's given that `newn > newk` for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, `newn` will be updated to a lesser value after executing the operation. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`, where `newizv` is `2^st - 1`; `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`.**
