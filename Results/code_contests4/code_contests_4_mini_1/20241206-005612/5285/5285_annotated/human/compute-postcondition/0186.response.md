Postcondition: ***`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn` as a result of multiplying `newk` repeatedly, and `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk` until it exceeded `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, it indicates that no multiplications were needed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
