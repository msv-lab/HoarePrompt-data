The value of `i` is assigned to 0, replacing its previous value of 11. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is assigned the value of `n`; `newn` is now equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is the accumulated value based on the sum of `newizv`, `st` is the last value computed before the final exit of the loop, `newnewk` is greater than or equal to `newn`, and `newk` is equal to `k`.

Output State: **`newn` is assigned the value of `n`; `newn` is now equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is the accumulated value based on the sum of `newizv`, `st` is the last value computed before the final exit of the loop, `newnewk` is greater than or equal to `newn`, and `newk` is equal to `k.**
