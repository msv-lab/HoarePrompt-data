The variable `newizv` is updated with the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. Initially, `newizv` is 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `newizv` becomes `0 * 2 + 1`, which equals 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1, and `newk` remains unchanged.**
