The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0, `cur` is 2; `d_osn[2]` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
