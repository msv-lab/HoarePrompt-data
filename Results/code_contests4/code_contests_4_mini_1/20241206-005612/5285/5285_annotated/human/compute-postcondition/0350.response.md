The variable `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value. Since `st` is the final value indicating the number of iterations and `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we can infer that `newk ** st` will be a significant value. However, without specific values for `newn` and `newk`, we can't determine the exact new value of `newn`. The other variables `i` and `izv` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the final value indicating the number of iterations, `i` is `st - 1`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`, with `newn` updated to `newn - newk ** st`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the final value indicating the number of iterations, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.**
