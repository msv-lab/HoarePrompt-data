The value of `st` is assigned to 0. Previously, `st` was greater than 0, so this assignment contradicts the previous condition. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1), and `izv` is the total accumulated value from `izv` after adding `newizv` for each iteration of the loop.
