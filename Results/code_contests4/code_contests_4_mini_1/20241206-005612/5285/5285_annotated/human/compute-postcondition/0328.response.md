According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, it is noted that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `newnewk` (which is `newk`) must be greater than `newn` after one adjustment. 

Since `newn` is equal to or less than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute at least once, `newk` must be greater than `newn`. Specifically, this means that `newk` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `newn`.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must be greater than `newn`**
