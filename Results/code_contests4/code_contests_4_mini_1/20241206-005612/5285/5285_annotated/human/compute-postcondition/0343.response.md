According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is greater than 0 (e.g., `st` = 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
