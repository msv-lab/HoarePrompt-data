According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newk` is greater than `newn`, which implies that `newn` currently is less than `newk * st`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk * st`. 

Since `st` is equal to `i + 1` and `i` is `st - 1`, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `newk * (i + 1)`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the final value indicating the number of iterations, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * (i + 1)`**
