To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. The loop will proceed if `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `newn` is equal to `n`
- `newk` is equal to `k`
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`
- `izv` is 0
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`
- `i` is equal to `st`

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `newn` (which is `n`) is greater than `newk ** st`.

Since we don't have specific values for `n`, `k`, or `st`, we can say that:
- If `newk` is greater than 0 and `st` is non-negative, then `newk ** st` will be a positive number (or 1 if `st` is 0). Thus, we need `n > newk ** st` to hold true.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute:
1. `n` (represented by `newn`) must be greater than `newk ** st`.
2. If `newk` is 0, then `newn` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given that `newn` is equal to `n` and `newk` is equal to `k`, we can summarize the necessary condition.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk ** st` for the loop to execute the first time**
