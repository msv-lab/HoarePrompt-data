According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 3, and `newk` remains unchanged**
