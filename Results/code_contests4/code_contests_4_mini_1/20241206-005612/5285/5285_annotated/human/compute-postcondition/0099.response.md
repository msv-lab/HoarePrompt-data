The loop continues executing as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Each iteration multiplies `newnewk` by `newk`, and increments `st` by 1.

If we analyze the output state after several iterations, we see that `newnewk` will be repeatedly multiplied by `newk` until it exceeds `newn`. 

Given that `newn` is initially less than or equal to `newk`, the loop will run until `newnewk` surpasses `newn`. 

After the loop finishes executing:
- `newnewk` will be greater than `newn`.
- `st` will equal the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk` before surpassing `newn`.
- `i` will still be less than 10, as it was initially less than 10 and was not modified in the loop.
- `newizv` remains 0, as it was not affected by the loop.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `newnewk` has surpassed `newn`, `st` indicates the number of multiplications, `i` is unchanged, and `newizv` remains the same.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is 0.**
