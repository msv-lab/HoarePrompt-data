According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely unless interrupted. The condition `i < 10` determines whether the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `st`. For the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be less than 10.

Since there are no other constraints or adjustments needed based on the provided states, we can simply repeat the program state as it is.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is equal to the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until `newn` became less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` remains unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `st`**
