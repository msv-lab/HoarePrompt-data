According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is `newn` multiplied by `newk^2`, and for the loop to execute one more time, it should be ensured that `newnewk` remains less than or equal to `newn`. 

Currently, `newnewk` being `newn` multiplied by `newk^2` means that if `newk` is greater than 1, `newnewk` will be greater than `newn`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `newk` would need to be adjusted to ensure it is equal to or less than 1 (to prevent `newnewk` from exceeding `newn`).

State: **`newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newn` multiplied by `newk^2`, `st` is 2, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newk` should be equal to or less than 1**
