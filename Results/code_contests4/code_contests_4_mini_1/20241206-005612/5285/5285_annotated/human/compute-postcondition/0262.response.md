The value of `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not specified, so we denote it as `newizv`. The other variables `newnewk` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is unchanged, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is unchanged, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**
