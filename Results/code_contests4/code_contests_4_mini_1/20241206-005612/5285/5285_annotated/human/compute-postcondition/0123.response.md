The value of `newizv` is assigned 0. This does not affect the other variables, as they retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `izv` remains unchanged.
