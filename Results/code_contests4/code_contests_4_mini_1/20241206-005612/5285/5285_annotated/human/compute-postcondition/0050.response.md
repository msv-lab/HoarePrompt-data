According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `i < 10` is true, since the `while True` part will always be true. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which is less than 10. Therefore, the loop can execute without needing to adjust any states.

State: **`b` is reduced to 1 or a prime number greater than 1; `d_osn` contains at least one key representing the count of prime factors; `s` is 0; `cur` is an odd integer greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`; `izv` is 0; `res` is -1; `newk` is equal to `k`; `newn` is equal to `n`; `i` is 0**.
