According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys in the `d_osn` dictionary. For the loop to execute at least once, `d_osn` must contain at least one key. Therefore, we need to ensure that `d_osn` is not empty. The states that need to be adjusted are:

- `d_osn` should have at least one prime factor in it, which means it must contain at least one key.
- The loop variable `k` will take the first key from `d_osn` when the loop executes.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we conclude:

State: **`b` is reduced to 1 or a prime number greater than 1; `d_osn` contains at least one key representing the count of prime factors; `s` is 0; `cur` is an odd integer greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`; `izv` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to store integer counts; `res` is -1; for the loop to execute the first time, `d_osn` must not be empty, and `k` is the first key in `d_osn`.**
