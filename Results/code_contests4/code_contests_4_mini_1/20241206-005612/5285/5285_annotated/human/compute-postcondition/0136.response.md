The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newk` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
