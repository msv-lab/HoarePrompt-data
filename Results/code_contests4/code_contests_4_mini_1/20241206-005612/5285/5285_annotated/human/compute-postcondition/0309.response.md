The variable `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 1. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

newizv = 1 * 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

The other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `newnewk`, `i`, `izv`, and `st`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 2, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2.**
