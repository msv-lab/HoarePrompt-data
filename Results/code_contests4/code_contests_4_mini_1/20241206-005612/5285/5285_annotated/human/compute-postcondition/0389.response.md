According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `newn` is decremented by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk`. 

This means that the current state must be adjusted so that `newn` is greater than `newk`. Therefore, you would need to ensure that `newn` is at least `newk + 1` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decremented by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk` meaning `newn` must be at least `newk + 1`**
