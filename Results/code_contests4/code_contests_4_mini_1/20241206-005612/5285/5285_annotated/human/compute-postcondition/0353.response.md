The code `newn = newn - newk ** st` updates the value of `newn`. The value of `newk` is raised to the power of `st`, and this result is subtracted from the current value of `newn`. The variable `newn` is affected, but the states of `newnewk`, `st`, `i`, and `izv` remain unchanged. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this operation will not alter the relationship between these two variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the final value indicating the number of iterations, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the final value indicating the number of iterations, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st.**
