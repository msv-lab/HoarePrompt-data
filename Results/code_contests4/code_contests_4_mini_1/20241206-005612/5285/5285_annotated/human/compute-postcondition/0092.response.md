The value of `st` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `st` is 0, after execution, `st` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is `newk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is `newk * newk`**
