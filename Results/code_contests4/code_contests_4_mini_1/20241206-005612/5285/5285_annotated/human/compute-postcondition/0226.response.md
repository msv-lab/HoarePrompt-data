According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is 2; `newizv` is modified to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
