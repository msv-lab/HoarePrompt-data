The variable `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are not specified, but the operation updates the value of `izv`. The values of `newn` and `newk` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
