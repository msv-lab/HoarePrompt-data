To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop condition: `newn > newk ** st`.

1. **Variables:**
   - `newn` is equal to `n`.
   - `newk` is equal to `k`.
   - `st` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `newn` (or `n`) is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st` (or `k ** st`).

3. **Current State:**
   - Right before the loop: `newnewk = newk ** st`, `st` is a non-negative integer, `b` is reduced to 1 or a prime number greater than 1, `d_osn` contains at least one key representing the count of prime factors, `s` is 0, `cur` is an odd integer greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`, `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - For the loop to execute, we need `n > k ** st`. 
   - If `st` is 0, then `k ** st` is 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - If `st` is greater than 0, `k ** st` will be greater than or equal to `k` if `k` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, `n` must be sufficiently larger than `k ** st` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjustments:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust either `n` or `k` or both, depending on their values.
   - Specifically, we can ensure that `n` is greater than `k ** st` by setting `n` to a value greater than that result.

State: **`newnewk` = `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`**.
