The value of `izv` is increased by `newizv`, which is calculated as ((2^st) - 1). Since `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is a positive integer. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `st`; `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1); `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `st`; `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1); `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
