According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 after each iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

State: **`newnewk` is unchanged, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
