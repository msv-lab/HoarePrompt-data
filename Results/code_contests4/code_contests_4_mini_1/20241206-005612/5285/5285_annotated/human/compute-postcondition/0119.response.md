Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1), and `izv` is the total accumulated value from `izv` after adding `newizv` for each iteration of the loop.**
