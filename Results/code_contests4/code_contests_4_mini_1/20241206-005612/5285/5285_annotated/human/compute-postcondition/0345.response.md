According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `st`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2, and `st` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`**
