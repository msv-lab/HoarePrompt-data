The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the affected variables are not impacted by this assignment. The variable `i` is already stated to be increased by 1, but the value of `newizv` does not depend on `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `newizv` is now 0 and acknowledges the increment of `i`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0**
