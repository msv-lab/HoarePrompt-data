Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / cur` if `b` is divisible by `cur`; `s` remains 0; `d_osn[2]` is incremented either to 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cur` if `b` is divisible by `cur`, or incremented by 1 otherwise. If `cur` is 2, then `cur` is updated to 3; otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 2.***
