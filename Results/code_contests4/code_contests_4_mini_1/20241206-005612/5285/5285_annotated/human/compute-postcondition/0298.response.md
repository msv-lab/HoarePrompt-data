The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is 2.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is 2**
