`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The variable `newk` is not specified in the initial state, but since `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, the value of `newnewk` is set to whatever `newk` is. The other variables, `st`, `i`, and `newizv`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk**.
