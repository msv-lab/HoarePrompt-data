The code snippet `newnewk *= newk` multiplies the value of `newnewk` by `newk`. Since the initial state indicates that `newizv` is 0, but does not provide a value for `newk` or `newnewk`, we cannot determine the new value of `newnewk`. The other variables (`st`, `i`, and `newizv`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `newnewk` is modified, but without specific values for `newk` and `newnewk`, we cannot provide exact numbers.

Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`.**
