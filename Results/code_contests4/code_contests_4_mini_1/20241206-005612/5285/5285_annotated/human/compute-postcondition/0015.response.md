Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / 2` if it is divisible by 2, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0, and `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1 while continuing to the next iteration. If `b` is not divisible by 2, and `cur` is 2, then `cur` is updated to 3 and `b` is not divisible by 3; otherwise, `cur` is updated to 4.***
