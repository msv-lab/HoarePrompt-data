The variable `izv` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 10, `newizv` is the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is either -1 or updated based on the comparison with `mlt`, and `k` is the next element in `d_osn`.
