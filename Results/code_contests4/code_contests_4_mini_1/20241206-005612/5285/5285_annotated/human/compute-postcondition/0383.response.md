To determine the conditions under which the loop can execute, we need to analyze the `while` loop condition: `newn > newk ** st`.

Currently, we know:
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is equal to `st`

The loop will execute if `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, it suggests that `newn` is not currently greater than `newk ** st` unless `st` is adjusted.

For the loop to execute:
- Since `newnewk > newn`, we need to ensure that `newk ** st` is less than `newn`. This necessitates that `st` (and thus `i`) be adjusted so that `newk ** st` does not exceed `newn`.

To ensure that `newn > newk ** st`, at minimum, `newk ** st` must be significantly less than `newn`. As `st` is a non-negative integer, we can conclude that we need to decrease `st` or confirm that `newk` is appropriately small relative to `newn`.

So, we can summarize:
- `newn` must be greater than the current value of `newk ** st`, implying a need for either a lower `st` or a greater `newn`.

State: **`newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn > newk ** st` must hold true**.
