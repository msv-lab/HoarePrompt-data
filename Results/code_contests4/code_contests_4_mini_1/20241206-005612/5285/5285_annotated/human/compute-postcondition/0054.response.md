The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. Since `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` will also have the value of `k`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is reduced to 1 or a prime number greater than 1; `d_osn` contains at least one key representing the count of prime factors; `s` is 0; `cur` is an odd integer greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`; `izv` is 0; `res` is -1; `newk` is equal to `k`; `newn` is equal to `n`; `i` is 1; `st` is 0; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `k`.
