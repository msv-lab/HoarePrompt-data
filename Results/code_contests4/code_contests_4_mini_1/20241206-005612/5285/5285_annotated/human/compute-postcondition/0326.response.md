The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of 0. Other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `st`, `izv`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is equal to the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until `newn` became less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` remains unchanged, `newizv` is 0, and `i` is increased by 1 to 1.
