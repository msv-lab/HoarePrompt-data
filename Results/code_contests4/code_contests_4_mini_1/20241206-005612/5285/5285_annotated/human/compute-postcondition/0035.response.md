Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. If `cur` is equal to 2, then `cur` is 3, `b` remains unchanged, `s` remains 0, and `d_osn[2]` is either incremented to 1 or 2 depending on whether `b` is divisible by `cur`. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 2, `b` remains unchanged, `s` remains 0, `d_osn[2]` is either incremented to 1 or 2 depending on the divisibility condition of `b` by `cur`, and we break out of the most internal loop.***
