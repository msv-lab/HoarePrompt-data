The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is equal to `newn`, and since `newizv` is 0, it does not affect `izv`. The variable `st` remains 0, and `i` remains 0. The condition about `newn` and `newk` raised to the power of `st` does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newn` multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition regarding `newn` and `newk` remains valid.

Output State: **`newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newn` multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition regarding `newn` and `newk` remains valid.**
