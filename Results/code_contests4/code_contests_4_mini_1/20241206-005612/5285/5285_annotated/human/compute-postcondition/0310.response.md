According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3, and `st` must be greater than 3.

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 3, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 3.**
