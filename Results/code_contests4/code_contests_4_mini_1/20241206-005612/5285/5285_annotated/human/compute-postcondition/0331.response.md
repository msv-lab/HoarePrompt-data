According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`, and `st` is increased by 1. 

Since `newnewk` is updated in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must still be less than or equal to `newn` after this update. Therefore, we need to ensure that the new value of `newnewk` (which is `newnewk * newk`) is less than or equal to `newn`. 

Thus, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to the new value of `newnewk`, which is `newnewk * newk`. 

State: **`newn` must be greater than or equal to `newnewk * newk`**.
