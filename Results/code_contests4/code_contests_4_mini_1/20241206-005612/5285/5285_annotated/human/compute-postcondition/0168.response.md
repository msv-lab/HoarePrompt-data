The value of `i` is assigned 0, which replaces its previous value of 10. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is either -1 or updated based on the comparison with `mlt`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`.
