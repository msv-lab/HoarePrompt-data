`st` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `st` is 2, after execution, `st` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is now 3.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is now 3.**
