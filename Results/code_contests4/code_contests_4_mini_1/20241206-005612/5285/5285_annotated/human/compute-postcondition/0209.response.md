According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. For the loop to execute, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`, which means that `newn` must be at least equal to `newnewk`. 

Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, we need to ensure that `newn` is adjusted to be equal to or greater than `newnewk`. Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` must be adjusted to be at least equal to `newnewk`.

State: **`st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newnewk`**
