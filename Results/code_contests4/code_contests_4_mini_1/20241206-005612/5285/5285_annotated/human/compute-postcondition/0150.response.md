The code updates the value of `newn` by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from it. Since `newk` remains unchanged, and `st` is greater than 0, this operation will affect `newn`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` were not specified, but we know that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`. 

Thus, after execution, `newn` will be decreased by `newk ** st`. The values of the other variables (`newk`, `st`, `izv`) are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newk` remains unchanged, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.**
