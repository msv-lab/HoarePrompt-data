According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. The loop continues as long as `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated by subtracting `newk`, which implies that `newn` is now less than or equal to its previous value. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it is necessary that `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk * st` after the last iteration.

State: **`newnewk` is unchanged; `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`**
