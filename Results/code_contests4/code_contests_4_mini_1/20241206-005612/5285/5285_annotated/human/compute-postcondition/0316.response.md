According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. The loop will continue as long as `newn` is greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated by subtracting `newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk` after the subtraction.

If `newk` has not changed and `newn` is now equal to or less than `newk`, we need to adjust `newn` accordingly. 

State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk`**.
