According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it remains less than or equal to `newn`. 

Since `newn` is equal to `n`, we need to ensure that `newnewk` is still less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `st` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
