The value of `b` is divided by `cur`. The initial state indicates that `b` is greater than 1, but the specific value of `cur` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `b` is updated, but we cannot determine the exact value of `b` after the division without knowing `cur`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / cur`; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `d_osn[2]` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cur`.**
