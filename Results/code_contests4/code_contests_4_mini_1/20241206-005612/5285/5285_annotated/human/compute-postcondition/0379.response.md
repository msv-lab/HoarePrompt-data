`newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 1, so the calculation is `1 * 2 + 1`, which equals 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
