The `while` loop condition is `True and i < 10`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Since `True` is always true, the only condition that matters for the loop to execute is `i < 10`.

Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which is less than 10. Therefore, the loop can execute one time without needing any adjustments to the state.

State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is either -1 or updated based on the comparison with `mlt`, `k` is the next element in `d_osn`**
