`st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 2, so after execution, `st` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` (previous value of `newnewk` is unknown).

Output State: **`st` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` (previous value of `newnewk` is unknown)**.
