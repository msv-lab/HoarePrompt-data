`cur` is assigned the value 3. The values of the other variables (`n`, `b`, `s`, and `d_osn`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0; `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1; `cur` is 3.
