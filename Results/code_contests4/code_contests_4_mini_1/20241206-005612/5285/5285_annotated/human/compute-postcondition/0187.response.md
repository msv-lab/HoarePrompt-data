According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `st`. For the loop to execute, `st` must be greater than 0, as the range function in Python generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `st`. Since `st` is equal to 0 indicates that no multiplications were needed, the loop will not execute if `st` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `st` needs to be greater than 0. Given the state described, `newnewk` must have been multiplied by `newk` at least once to exceed `newn`, which implies that `st` must be at least 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
