The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, but the previous value of `newnewk` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk.**
