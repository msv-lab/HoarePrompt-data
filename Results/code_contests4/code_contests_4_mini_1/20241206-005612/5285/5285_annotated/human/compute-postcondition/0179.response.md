The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`newn`, `newnewk`, and `newk`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is incremented by 1.**
