`izv` is increased by `newizv`, and the previous value of `izv` is unknown. The state of `newn` is not affected directly by this operation, but it is noted that `newn` must still be greater than `newk * st` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated based on the calculation, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated based on the calculation, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`.**
