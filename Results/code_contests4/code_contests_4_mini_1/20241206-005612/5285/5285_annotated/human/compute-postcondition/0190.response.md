The variable `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, but it is multiplied by 2 and then increased by 1. The other variables (`newn`, `newnewk`, `st`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**
