To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition: `newn > newk ** st`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `izv` has been increased by `newizv`, where `newizv` is `2^st - 1`.
- `newn` has been decremented by `newk`.

For the loop to execute again, the condition `newn > newk ** st` must hold true.

Since `newn` has been decremented, it could potentially be less than or equal to `newk ** st`, depending on the values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. 

To ensure that the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `newn` such that it remains greater than `newk ** st`. This implies that `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st` after the decrement.

Therefore, we can express the necessary adjustment like this: `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st`.

State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`, where `newizv` is `2^st - 1`; `newn` is decremented by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`**.
