The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, after execution, `st` becomes 1. The other variables (`newizv`, `newnewk`, `i`, `newn`, and `newk`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newn` multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and the condition regarding `newn` and `newk` remains valid.

Output State: **`newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newn` multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and the condition regarding `newn` and `newk` remains valid.**
