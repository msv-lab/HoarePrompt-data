The value of `st` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `st` is 0, after execution, `st` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newk` is less than or equal to `1`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newk` is less than or equal to `1`**
