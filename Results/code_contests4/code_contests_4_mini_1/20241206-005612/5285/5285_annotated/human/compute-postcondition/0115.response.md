The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this operation will modify `newn`. The other variables (`st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `newn` after the computation.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `st`; `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1); `izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.**
