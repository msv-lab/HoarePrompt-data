The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Given that `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, this means `newnewk` will now be equal to `newk` raised to the power of four (since cubing `newk` and then multiplying by `newk` results in `newk` to the power of four). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of 2, `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` raised to the power of 4, `st` is 2, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of 2, `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` raised to the power of 4, `st` is 2, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0**
