The variable `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is unknown, but it will now be increased by 1. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newk`, and `newn`) are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and the loop will execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`; `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and the loop will execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`; `st` is increased by 1.**
