The value of `st` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The other variables `newn`, `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.**
