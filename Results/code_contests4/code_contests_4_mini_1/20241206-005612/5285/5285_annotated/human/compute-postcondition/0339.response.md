The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, indicating that `newnewk` was not multiplied by `newk`, and `newk` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
