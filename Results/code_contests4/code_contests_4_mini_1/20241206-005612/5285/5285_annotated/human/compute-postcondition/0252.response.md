`st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 3, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0, and `newnewk` is unchanged as it is multiplied by an unknown value of `newk`. 

Output State: **`st` is 3, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0, and `newnewk` is unchanged as it is multiplied by an unknown value of `newk`.**
