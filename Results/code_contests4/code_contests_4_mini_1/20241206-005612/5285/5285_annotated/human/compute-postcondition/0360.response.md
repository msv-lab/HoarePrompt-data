The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is `st - 1`, where `st` is currently 0. Therefore, `i` becomes `0 - 1 + 1`, which results in `i` being 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.**
