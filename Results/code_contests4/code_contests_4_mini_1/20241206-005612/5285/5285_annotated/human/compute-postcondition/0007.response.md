The value of `b` is divided by `cur`. Since `cur` is 2, `b` will be updated to `b / 2`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0, `cur` is 2; `d_osn[2]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0, `cur` is 2; `d_osn[2]` is 1**
