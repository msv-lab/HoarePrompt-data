The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. The previous value of `newn` is not specified, but it must have been greater than `newk` for the loop to execute again. The value of `izv` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st`, and `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st`, and `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`.**
