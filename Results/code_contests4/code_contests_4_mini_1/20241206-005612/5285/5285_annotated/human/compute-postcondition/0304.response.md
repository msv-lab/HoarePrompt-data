The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `st` is the number of times the loop executed until `newnewk` exceeded `newn`, and `st` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
