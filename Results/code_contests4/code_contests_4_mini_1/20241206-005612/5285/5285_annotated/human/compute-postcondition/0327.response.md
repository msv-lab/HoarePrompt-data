The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, which remains unchanged from its previous state. This operation does not affect any other variables, so the output state reflects the unchanged values. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is equal to the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until `newn` became less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` remains unchanged, `newizv` is 0, `i` is increased by 1 to 1; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.**
