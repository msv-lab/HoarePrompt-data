`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 1, the calculation will be `1 * 2 + 1`, which equals 3. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newk`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3, and `newk` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3, and `newk` remains unchanged**.
