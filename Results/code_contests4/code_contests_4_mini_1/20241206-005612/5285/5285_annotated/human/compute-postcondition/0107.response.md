According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated.**
