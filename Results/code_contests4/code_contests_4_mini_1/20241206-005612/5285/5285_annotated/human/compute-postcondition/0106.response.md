The value of `newizv` is updated according to the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially defined as `newizv * 2 + 1`, it will be recalculated based on its previous value. The states of other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated.**
