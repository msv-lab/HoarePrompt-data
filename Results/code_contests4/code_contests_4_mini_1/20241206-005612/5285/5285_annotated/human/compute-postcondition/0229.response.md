To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `newn > newk ** st`. 

Given the states right before the while loop:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is greater than 0
- `i` is `st - 1`
- `newizv` is `(2^st) - 1`

The condition for the loop to execute is for `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st`. 

1. **Understanding the variables**:
   - `newk` must be defined in relation to `newnewk` and `newn`. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we cannot currently determine the value of `newk` directly, but we know `newk` should be less than `newn ** (1/st)` for the loop to execute.
   - Since `st` is greater than 0, `newk` raised to `st` can lead to a very small value if `newk` is a fraction less than 1.

2. **Necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, we need `newk` to be adjusted such that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`. 
   - If `newk` is currently set to a value that makes `newk ** st` greater than or equal to `newn`, then it needs to be adjusted downwards or `newn` needs to be adjusted upwards.

Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we know that `newk` must be less than `newn`. Thus, to satisfy the loop condition, we would need to ensure that `newk` is less than `newn ** (1/st)`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time then `newk` must be adjusted to be less than `newn ** (1/st)`**.
