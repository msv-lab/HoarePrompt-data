The variable `newizv` is updated with the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, but it will be doubled and increased by 1. The values of `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**.
